6/10/2025,Article,School shooting leaves Austria's second city in shock and grief,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/cewd980dgl9o,"There is shock, sadness and disbelief in Graz, after the worst shooting in modern Austrian history left 11 people dead, including the gunman. ""We never could have imagined that this could have happened here, in our place. It's a sad day for the whole city,"" said Reka, who lives close to the school. For many years, Austria had been spared the pain of mass school shootings. But that all changed at about 10:00 on Tuesday when a former student ran amok at a secondary school in the Dreierschützengasse, close to the main station in Austria's second largest city. Morning classes were under way when the attack took place. Some students at the school would have been taking their final exams. It took police 17 minutes to bring the situation under control. By the time it was over six female victims and three males had died. Hours later, a seventh female victim, an adult woman, died in hospital. Several others remain in hospital, some with critical injuries. The gunman, a 21-year-old Austrian citizen with two firearms, took his own life at the school. A former pupil who never passed his final exams, he is reported to have seen himself as a victim of bullying. Local resident Reka told me she couldn't understand how an attack like this could have happened in her well-ordered city. ""This area is quiet, safe and beautiful,"" she said. ""People are nice, the school is good."" Austria's President Alexander Van der Bellen said: ""This horror cannot be put into words. What happened today in a school in Graz, hits our country right in the heart. These were young people who had their whole lives ahead of them. A teacher who accompanied them on their way."" He said there was ""nothing at this moment that can alleviate the pain that the parents, grandparents, siblings and friends of those murdered are feeling"". Austria's Chancellor Christian Stocker, who rushed to the scene with the Interior Minister Gerhard Karner, called it ""a national tragedy, that had shaken the entire country."" He said there were no words to describe ""the pain and grief that we all – the whole of Austria – is feeling"". Three days of mourning have been declared in Austria. Flags on the Hofburg Palace in Vienna, where President van der Bellen has his office, will fly at half-mast. Austria has one of the most heavily armed civilian populations in Europe, with an estimated 30 firearms per 100 persons, according to the Small Arms Survey, an independent research project. But school shootings here are rare. There have been a few incidents over the years that have involved far fewer casualties: Austria's most violent gun attack in recent years took place in the heart of Vienna in November 2020. Four people were killed and 22 injured when a convicted jihadist ran through the centre of the city opening fire, before he was eventually shot by police. Machine guns and pump action guns are banned, while revolvers, pistols and semi-automatic weapons are allowed only with official authorisation. Rifles and shotguns are permitted with a firearms licence or a valid hunting licence, or for members of traditional shooting clubs. The Graz gunman is understood to have owned both firearms legally, and he had no criminal record. One of his guns was bought only the day before the attack, according to one report. Outside the school, a young man on a bicycle watched as the police allowed security vehicles through the security cordon round the school. ""It's horrific,"" he told me. ""This is my home. I can't understand how so many people my age are dead. This shouldn't happen here."" Copyright 2025 BBC.

6/10/2025,Article,"World fertility rates in 'unprecedented decline', UN says",https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/clynq459wxgo,"Namrata Nangia and her husband have been toying with the idea of having another child since their five-year-old daughter was born. But it always comes back to one question: 'Can we afford it?' She lives in Mumbai and works in pharmaceuticals, her husband works at a tyre company. But the costs of having one child are already overwhelming - school fees, the school bus, swimming lessons, even going to the GP is expensive. It was different when Namrata was growing up. ""We just used to go to school, nothing extracurricular, but now you have to send your kid to swimming, you have to send them to drawing, you have to see what else they can do."" According to a new report by the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), the UN agency for reproductive rights, Namrata's situation is becoming a global norm. The agency has taken its strongest line yet on fertility decline, warning that hundreds of millions of people are not able to have the number of children they want, citing the prohibitive cost of parenthood and the lack of a suitable partner as some of the reasons. UNFPA surveyed 14,000 people in 14 countries about their fertility intentions. One in five said they haven't had or expect they won't have their desired number of children. The countries surveyed - South Korea, Thailand, Italy, Hungary, Germany, Sweden, Brazil, Mexico, US, India, Indonesia, Morocco, South Africa, and Nigeria - account for a third of the global population. They are a mix of low, middle and high-income countries and those with low and high fertility. UNFPA surveyed young adults and those past their reproductive years. ""The world has begun an unprecedented decline in fertility rates,"" says Dr Natalia Kanem, head of UNFPA. ""Most people surveyed want two or more children. Fertility rates are falling in large part because many feel unable to create the families they want. And that is the real crisis,"" she says. ""Calling this a crisis, saying it's real. That's a shift I think,"" says demographer Anna Rotkirch, who has researched fertility intentions in Europe and advises the Finnish government on population policy. ""Overall, there's more undershooting than overshooting of fertility ideals,"" she says. She has studied this at length in Europe and is interested to see it reflected at a global level. She was also surprised by how many respondents over 50 (31%) said they had fewer children than they wanted. The survey, which is a pilot for research in 50 countries later this year, is limited in its scope. When it comes to age groups within countries for example, the sample sizes are too small to make conclusions. But some findings are clear. In all countries, 39% of people said financial limitations prevented them from having a child. The highest response was in Korea (58%), the lowest in Sweden (19%). In total, only 12% of people cited infertility - or difficulty conceiving - as a reason for not having the number of children they wanted to. But that figure was higher in countries including Thailand (19%), the US (16%), South Africa (15%), Nigeria (14%) and India (13%). ""This is the first time that [the UN] have really gone all-out on low fertility issues,"" says Prof Stuart Gietel-Basten, demographer at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. Until recently the agency focused heavily on women who have more children than they wanted and the ""unmet need"" for contraception. Still, the UNFPA is urging caution in response to low fertility. ""Right now, what we're seeing is a lot of rhetoric of catastrophe, either overpopulation or shrinking population, which leads to this kind of exaggerated response, and sometimes a manipulative response,"" says Dr Kanem.  ""In terms of trying to get women to have more children, or fewer."" She points out that 40 years ago China, Korea, Japan, Thailand and Turkey were all worried their populations were too high. By 2015 they wanted to boost fertility. ""We want to try as far as possible to avoid those countries enacting any kind of panicky policies,"" says Prof Gietel-Basten. ""We are seeing low fertility, population ageing, population stagnation used as an excuse to implement nationalist, anti-migrant policies and gender conservative policies,"" he says. UNFPA found an even bigger barrier to children than finances was a lack of time. For Namrata in Mumbai that rings true. She spends at least three hours a day commuting to her office and back. When she gets home she is exhausted but wants to spend time with her daughter. Her family doesn't get much sleep. ""After a working day, obviously you have that guilt, being a mom, that you're not spending enough time with your kid,"" she says. ""So, we're just going to focus on one.""

6/10/2025,Article,UK sanctions far-right Israeli ministers for 'inciting violence' against Palestinians,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/c8xgk1ek19lo,"The UK has sanctioned two far-right Israeli ministers over ""repeated incitements of violence against Palestinian communities"" in the occupied West Bank. Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich will both be banned from entering the UK and will have any assets in the UK frozen as part of the measures announced by the foreign secretary. David Lammy said Finance Minister Smotrich and National Security Minister Ben-Gvir had ""incited extremist violence and serious abuses of Palestinian human rights"".  In response, Israel said: ""It is outrageous that elected representatives and members of the government are subjected to these kind of measures."" The sanctions are part of a joint move by the UK, Norway, Australia, Canada and New Zealand announced on Tuesday. Both Smotrich and Ben-Gvir have also been criticised for their stance on the war in Gaza. Both ministers oppose allowing aid into Gaza and have called for Palestinians there to be resettled outside the territory. The Foreign Office said: ""As Palestinian communities in the West Bank continue to suffer from severe acts of violence by extremist Israeli settlers which also undermine a future Palestinian state, the UK has joined Australia, Canada, New Zealand and Norway in stepping up the international response."" After announcing the sanctions, Lammy said: ""These actions are not acceptable. This is why we have taken action now – to hold those responsible to account. ""We will strive to achieve an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, the immediate release of the remaining hostages by Hamas which can have no future role in the governance of Gaza, a surge in aid and a path to a two-state solution."" Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said the cabinet would meet next week to respond to what he called an ""unacceptable decision"". The Foreign Office added that ""alongside partners Australia, Canada, New Zealand and Norway, the UK is clear that the rising violence and intimidation by Israeli settlers against Palestinian communities in the West Bank must stop"". In a statement it said the measures taken against Smotrich and Ben-Gvir ""cannot be seen in isolation from events in Gaza where Israel must uphold International Humanitarian Law"". The ministers lead ultra-nationalist parties in the governing coalition, which holds an eight-seat majority in parliament. The support of Ben-Gvir's Otzma Yehudit (Jewish Power) party, which holds six seats, and Smotrich's Religious Zionism party, which holds seven seats, is crucial to the government's survival. Speaking at the inauguration of a new settlement in the West Bank, Smotrich said he felt ""contempt"" towards the UK's move. ""Britain has already tried once to prevent us from settling the cradle of our homeland, and we cannot do it again,"" he said. ""We are determined, God willing, to continue building."" The minister was alluding to the period when Britain governed Palestine and imposed restrictions on Jewish immigration, most significantly from the late 1930s to late 1940s. Israel has built about 160 settlements housing some 700,000 Jews since it occupied the West Bank and East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war. The vast majority of the international community considers the settlements illegal under international law - a position supported by an advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) last year - although Israel disputes this. Speaking in the Commons on Tuesday, Foreign Office Minister Hamish Falconer said that 2024 had seen the ""worst settler violence"" in the West Bank in the past two decades and this year was ""on track to be just as violent"". Commenting on the sanctions imposed on the two ministers, Falconer said they were ""responsible for inciting settler violence"" in the West Bank which has ""led to the deaths of Palestinian civilians and the displacement of whole towns and villages"". Falconer said Smotrich and Ben-Gvir had continued their ""appalling"" rhetoric despite warnings from the UK government, and so action was taken. The possibility of sanctioning these two ministers has long been in the pipeline.  In October, Lord Cameron said he had planned to sanction the pair, when he was foreign secretary from 2023-24, as a way of putting pressure on Israel. The UK's decision reflects growing popular and parliamentary pressure to take further action against the Israeli government for its operations both in Gaza and the West Bank. It also comes after a steady escalation of pressure by the UK and other allies.  Last month the leaders of Britain, France and Canada issued a joint statement saying that Israel was at risk of breaking international law.  The UK also broke off trade talks with Israel. In the Commons last month, Lammy described remarks by Smotrich about ""cleansing"" Gaza of Palestinians as ""monstrous"" and ""dangerous"" extremism. Conservative shadow home secretary Dame Priti Patel did not directly comment on the sanctions, but said: ""We have been clear that the British government must leverage its influence at every opportunity to ensure the remaining hostages [held by Hamas] are released, that aid continues to reach those who need it, and a sustainable end to the conflict is achieved.""  Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey welcomed the sanctions, but said it was ""disappointing"" that the Conservative government and Labour ""took so long to act"". It is 20 months since Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza in response to the unprecedented Hamas-led cross-border attack on Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. At least 54,927 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Copyright 2025 BBC.

6/10/2025,Article,Newsom says Trump 'deranged' as thousands more troops sent to LA,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/cyvmz3egr7do,"US President Donald Trump's administration has sent thousands more troops to Los Angeles on a fourth day of chaotic protests against immigration raids, as the unrest spread to other US cities. Some 700 US Marines have been deployed to the LA area and the contingent of National Guard troops mobilised to help quell the disorder has been doubled to 4,000. California Governor Gavin Newsom said the move was fulfilling ""the deranged fantasy of a dictatorial president"". The state is suing the president for sending in troops without the governor's permission. It is highly unusual for the American military to have any domestic law enforcement role. At least four Mexican nationals detained in LA since Friday have already been deported back to Mexico, the country's foreign affairs office announced on Monday. The standoff in LA represents the first time since 1965 that a president has sent National Guard troops to a US city without a governor's approval. US Marines were previously deployed domestically for major disasters such as Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and the 11 September 2001 attacks. The Trump administration has so far not invoked the Insurrection Act, which would allow his deployed troops to directly participate in civilian policing. On Tuesday morning, the LA County prosecutor reiterated the view of state authorities that the extra deployment was unnecessary. ""We have not reached the point where local law enforcement has got beyond its means to deal with the situation,"" District Attorney Nathan Hochman told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Hochman said only a ""small fraction"" of the area's population were actually protesting, and an even smaller number had broken the law.  But he said there had been multiple instances of crime, ""whether it's burning Waymo vehicles, throwing cinder blocks and bricks at the police, driving a motorcycle into the police, or vandalising - and defacing through graffiti - public and private buildings"". The 700 members of 2nd Battalion, 7th Marines, from Twentynine Palms, California, will help protect federal property and personnel, including immigration agents, said the US military. On Monday evening, Los Angeles police officers fired stun grenades and gas canisters to disperse hundreds of demonstrators who gathered outside a federal detention centre in downtown LA where undocumented immigrants have been held. National Guard forces formed a cordon to keep protesters out of the building in the heart of America's second largest city. Some demonstrators had thrown objects at officers, the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) also said on Monday. Late that day, US Attorney General Pam Bondi revealed the identity of a man accused of assault for throwing rocks at federal agents. Bondi said a search warrant has been conducted on his home, and that the man, Elpidio Reyna, would be added to America's ""Most Wanted"" list.  Protests also sprang up in at least nine other US cities, including New York, Philadelphia, Dallas, Austin and San Francisco. Demonstrators originally took to the streets of LA on Friday after it emerged Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers were raiding Latino areas. The protests unravelled into looting, self-driving cars being torched, rocks thrown at law enforcement and a major freeway blocked by demonstrators. The LAPD says it arrested 29 people on Saturday night and 21 more on Sunday. Suspects face charges ranging from attempted murder with a Molotov cocktail, to assault on a police officer, to looting. The LAPD also says more than 600 rubber bullets and other less-than-lethal rounds were used over the weekend. At the White House on Monday, Trump said his decision to send in the National Guard had stopped the city from ""burning down"". ""You watch same clips I did: cars burning, people rioting, we stopped it,"" the president said. ""I feel we had no choice."" A CBS News/YouGov poll conducted in early June, before the protests kicked off, found 54% of Americans saying they approved of Trump's deportation policy, and 50% approved of how he is handling immigration.  That compares with smaller numbers of 42% who gave approval to his economic policy and 39% for his policy on tackling inflation.  On Monday, the Republican president said he supported a suggestion that California's governor should be arrested over possible obstruction of his administration's immigration enforcement measures. Newsom, who has engaged in a war of words in recent days with Trump, responded on X that ""this is an unmistakable step toward authoritarianism"". He said the troop deployment was ""about stroking a dangerous president's ego"". Trump's border tsar Tom Homan later told CNN he had ""not at this time"" seen anything that he felt would warrant an arrest of the California governor. Trump also sent a direct warning to protesters who confronted police and federal forces. He wrote on social media: ""IF THEY SPIT, WE WILL HIT, and I promise you they will be hit harder than they have ever been hit before. Such disrespect will not be tolerated!"" At a press conference on Monday evening, LA Mayor Karen Bass echoed the views of other local officials by saying the deployment of troops was a ""deliberate attempt"" by the Trump administration to ""create disorder and chaos in our city"". The city leader also said she was aware of at least ""five raids by ICE throughout the region"" on Monday, including one near her grandson's school. Trump's deployment of the National Guard faces a legal challenge from Newsom. The lawsuit argues that the president was violating the US Constitution and California's sovereignty. Newsom has also threatened to take separate legal action over the Marine deployment.  Trump has argued that the administration of his predecessor, Democratic President Joe Biden, allowed millions of immigrants to enter the country illegally. He has pledged to deport record numbers of undocumented migrants, setting a goal of at least 3,000 daily arrests. Copyright 2025 BBC.

6/10/2025,Article,Perfect storm as Trump's mass deportation drive collides with city of immigrants,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/c3d47v7394go,"This weekend, tensions boiled over in the Los Angeles area after a week of immigration sweeps in the region sparked violent protests against the Trump administration and the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency. President Donald Trump's decision to send 700 US Marines and 4,000 National Guard troops to the Los Angeles area to support the federal response to the unrest has opened a volatile chapter in his mass deportation campaign. The location of the raids and subsequent protests – a liberal-leaning city in a state controlled by Democrats – also gave the White House an ideal public foil as it seeks to show progress on removing undocumented immigrants and instilling law and order. Governor Gavin Newsom, a Democrat and prominent critic of the president, wrote on X that the troop deployment was a ""deranged fantasy of a dictatorial President"". The raids in America's second-biggest city are unfolding against the backdrop of an aggressive push to raise arrest and deportation numbers, as the administration has been disappointed with its current pace. ICE has ramped up its enforcement actions in recent weeks as it faces pressure to show progress on Trump's signature policy initiative. The agency arrested 2,200 people on 4 June, according to NBC News, a record for a single day.  The network reported that hundreds of those arrested were enrolled in a programme known as Alternative to Detention, which allows for the release and monitoring of individuals not deemed an immediate threat. White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, the man widely seen as the intellectual architect of the deportation policy, has repeatedly said the White House hopes that ICE can scale up to 3,000 arrests a day, up from 660 or so during the first 100 days of Trump's presidency. ""President Trump is going to keep pushing to get that number up higher each and every single day,"" Miller told Fox News in late May. The Trump administration has also lagged behind on its goals for mass deportations. During the first 100 days of the administration, deportations were on par with, and at times below, those recorded during the last year of Joe Biden's presidency - according to a year-over-year comparison of publicly available data.  It is difficult to know the exact rate of daily deportations; the White House stopped publishing this figure early in 2020, during Trump's first term. ""I'm not satisfied with the numbers,"" the administration's border tsar, Tom Homan, told reporters at the White House at the end of May. ""We need to increase."" Homan added that the Trump administration had ""increased the teams a lot"" and that ""we expect a fast increase in the number of arrests"". Several senior ICE officials - including Kenneth Genalo, its top deportation official - have left their roles at the agency in recent months.  In February, ICE also moved two top officials overseeing deportations, as well as the agency's acting director, Caleb Vitello. At the time of the more recent reshuffle, the agency characterised the move as organisational realignments that will ""help ICE achieve President Trump and the American people's mandate of arresting and deporting illegal aliens and making American communities safe"". The Department of Homeland Security said in a press release that the immigrants detained in the recent Los Angeles raids included individuals convicted of sex crimes, burglary, and drug related charges, among other offences.  Local immigration advocates and community members, however, say that families have been torn apart and nonviolent immigrants detained. At a rally on Monday, Los Angeles City Councilmember Ysabel Jurado said that a Friday raid at a warehouse in the Fashion District ""was not about public safety, it was a fear driven, state violence designed to silence, to intimidate, to disappear"". While opinion polls show that Trump's immigration policies are popular with a majority of Americans, some of his backers have expressed concern about tactics. The co-founder of Latinas for Trump, for example, Florida State Senator Ileana Garcia, wrote on X that ""this is not what we voted for"". ""I understand the importance of deporting criminal aliens, but what we are witnessing are arbitrary measures to hunt down people who are complying with their immigration hearings - in many cases, with credible fear of persecution claims - all driven by a Miller-like desire to satisfy a self-fabricated deportation goal,"" she added. Federal authorities have conducted more frequent immigration raids across the US, in states that lean both towards Democrats and Republicans. Some Republican-controlled states, like Tennessee, have assisted federal authorities. ""California was willing to resist,"" said John Acevedo, an associate dean at Emory Law School, who studies free speech and protests in the US. Images of violence and resistance on the streets of Los Angeles gave Trump a catalyst for the deployment of the National Guard. ""For his base, it does quite a bit. It shows he's serious, and allows them to show he will use all means necessary to enforce his [immigration] rules,"" Prof Acevedo said. Protesters in Los Angeles - which calls itself a sanctuary city, meaning it limits co-operation with federal immigration enforcement - did not relish the role they believed the administration had chosen for their city. ""This is my people, you know, I'm fighting for us,"" said Maria Gutierrez, a Mexican-American who protested for two days in Paramount, a city in LA County that saw protests after residents spotted ICE agents in the area. The unrest there involved looting and at least one car burning. Authorities used rubber bullets and tear gas. She said there are some protesting in LA, including those in the nearby city of Compton, that share a belief that they were protecting the city from immigration enforcement and saw the Trump administration's threats as a challenge. Ms Gutierrez believed undocumented immigrants who commit violent offences should be targeted, but not those who she believes work hard and aspire to a better life. ""This is our city. We're angry, we know how to protect ourselves and this isn't going to scare us,"" she said. But the community is not united in support for the protests that have captured national attention. Juan, who lives near Paramount, came to the US illegally and later became a citizen, but supports ICE's actions. ""ICE agents have a job to do, just like you and I,"" said Juan, who asked the BBC to withhold his last name given the federal operations in the area. He said he worked for years as a day labourer, but gained citizenship and has four children who graduated from college. ""It's hard,"" he said. ""I have family who don't have papers, too. ""But you can't really fight it if you're here and you're not supposed to be."" ""A crime is a crime,"" he said. Copyright 2025 BBC.

6/10/2025,Article,Ketamine swapped for salt as smugglers exploit Europe loophole in booming market,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/c201jjgkvjlo,"The customs officers at Brussels Airport were stunned. They had opened crates in the back of a lorry expecting to find a tonne of medical ketamine. But somewhere on its journey, the white powder had been switched for salt. After zigzagging hundreds of miles across Europe, the contents of the consignment had been verified five days earlier by customs officers at Schipol Airport in the Netherlands, ready for its road trip to Belgium. But somewhere between Amsterdam and Brussels the ketamine had vanished - the authorities believe most likely into the black market - replaced by the salt and freshly forged documents. While it is not known where the drug ended up, and no-one responsible has been caught, this case shows the increasingly elaborate methods crime gangs are using to traffic ketamine across Europe and into the UK. They exploit its classification in some countries as a legal medicine by transporting it across multiple borders to confuse the authorities. Consignments then disappear and are illegally sold as a hallucinogenic drug. ""It's clear that criminal organisations are misusing all these long routes,"" says Marc Vancoillie, head of Belgium's central directorate of drugs. Belgian investigators have uncovered at least 28 similar consignment switches - involving an estimated 28 tonnes of ketamine - since this case in 2023. Some criminal gangs are now making more money from selling ketamine than other illegal drugs such as cocaine, Mr Vancoille told us, describing the situation as an epidemic. In the UK, ketamine consumption has risen 85% between 2023 and 2024, wastewater analysis - sampling human waste from sewage plants to measure the scale of illicit drug use - suggests. Latest figures show there were 53 deaths involving ketamine in 2023. It has been linked to high-profile deaths including those of Friends actor Matthew Perry and drag star The Vivienne. Abuse of the drug can also lead to cognitive problems and permanent bladder damage. UK organised crime groups ""are clearly stepping into this new market"", says Adam Thompson from the National Crime Agency (NCA). The challenge for European law enforcement agencies is compounded by the fact that ketamine is used as a vital legitimate anaesthetic in hospitals and veterinary clinics, as well as being a popular illegal recreational drug. File on 4 Investigates has examined how organised crime groups are exploiting this dual classification. In countries such as the UK and Belgium, ketamine is classified as a narcotic. But in countries including Austria, Germany and the Netherlands, it is regulated as a medicine, meaning it faces less scrutiny during its import and transit. ""It starts off being produced for those markets and exported from countries like India,"" said Mr Thompson. ""But then it's diverted by organised crime groups into illicit supply."" Armed with this knowledge, the smugglers have developed a preferred route - shipping the drug from India, where it is legitimately produced as a medicine, into Germany, through the Netherlands and Belgium, then on to the UK. In the case of the disappearing consignment at Brussels Airport, the drug was originally flown from India to Austria. It was then driven to Germany before being flown to the Netherlands where it was unloaded again and readied for the road trip to Belgium. During all of these connections it was being moved legally. But, somewhere during this last leg, it was swapped with salt - and it is thought the ketamine entered the black market for illegal sales. In another case, a container arriving at the Belgian port of Antwerp which had been verified as containing ketamine, was found to hold sugar. Criminal groups are also exploiting legal supply chains by setting up front companies to import ketamine under the guise of legitimate use, only to divert it into illicit markets once it arrives in Europe. The more countries and jurisdictions it goes through, the more difficult it is to investigate, requiring liaison between law enforcement agencies, Belgian and Dutch Police told the BBC. It also helps disguise where the front company - an import company which obtains a legitimate licence - is based. ""They [the criminals] will put all kinds of steps - companies in different countries - in between. So it's hard for us to backtrack if we find any large quantities of ketamine,"" said Ch Insp Peter Jansen, a drug expert from the Dutch police. Germany, Europe's biggest importer of ketamine, has a huge pharmaceutical industry, so large consignments are less likely to raise suspicions. In 2023 alone,100 tonnes of ketamine were imported from India, Mr Vancoillie says - far more than would be expected for legitimate medical and veterinary use. ""Between 20 to 25% will be necessary for legal purposes and not more,"" he told us. ""It's tonnes and tonnes and tonnes that disappeared in criminal routes."" European police forces say they are planning to liaise with the Indian authorities to try to tackle the problem, with Germany's Federal Criminal Police Office telling us it carries out intensive monitoring of new psychoactive substances like ketamine. It added it was ""in close contact with national and international authorities, organisations and institutions in order to be able to anticipate and react to further developments and new trends"". The smuggling network sees plenty of reward in England and Wales, where an estimated 269,000 people aged 16-59 reported using ketamine in the year ending March 2024, government figures show. Among young people aged 16-24, usage has soared by 231% since 2013. ""Ketamine is a very cheap drug compared to some other illicit drugs,"" the NCA's Adam Thompson explained. ""It's sold for about £20 a gram at street level, compared to £60 to £100 for cocaine."" The drug is being smuggled into the UK through two main routes - concealed in small parcels sent by post, or hidden in lorries and vans arriving via ferries and the Channel Tunnel, the NCA believes. With hundreds of thousands of parcels arriving in the UK only a small percentage are spotted. It's ""very easy to hide that needle in the haystack,"" Mr Thompson added. In Belgium, some criminal groups are using AirBnBs to store ketamine before sending it through France to the UK, by cars, lorries or trucks, according to Mr Vancoillie. In one case, somebody reported as suspicious a group of men who were moving IKEA boxes into a van. The vehicle had been hired, which meant the authorities were able to track its prior movements back to an AirBnB in Staden, Belgium. There, they found 480kg (1,058lbs) of ketamine, along with 117kg of cocaine, and 63kg of heroin, stored in a garage. Eight British nationals were eventually linked to the case and prosecuted.

6/10/2025,Article,"We quit our jobs, sold our home twice and spent 10 years fighting for the truth",https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/cdxn5d4dzrwo,"Warning: This article contains upsetting details and reference to suicide There didn't seem to be anything out of the ordinary when Jane Figueiredo spoke to her daughter that night on the phone. ""Alice asked me to bring her some snacks for the next time we visited,"" Jane says. But that call, at 22:15 on 6 July 2015, was the last conversation they ever had. Around three hours later, Jane and her husband, Max, were being driven to hospital in a police car at speed. They had been told their daughter was gravely ill. Alice had got into a communal toilet at Goodmayes Hospital, in Ilford, east London, where she was a mental health patient, and taken her own life. She was just months away from her 23rd birthday. On Monday, almost 10 years later, the North East London NHS Foundation Trust (NELFT), which runs the hospital, and Benjamin Aninakwa, the manager of the ward Alice was on, were found guilty of health and safety failings over her death. The jury decided not enough was done by NELFT, or Aninakwa, to prevent Alice from killing herself. It's taken a decade of battling by Alice's parents to uncover the truth about how the 22-year-old was able to take her own life in a unit where she was meant to be safe. They twice had to sell their home, quit their jobs and have worked full-time on the case. The jury deliberated for 24 days to reach all the verdicts, after which time the Trust was cleared of the more serious charge of corporate manslaughter, while Aninakwa, 53, of Grays, Essex, was cleared of gross negligence manslaughter. During the seven-month trial, we sat a few seats away from the family. They've sometimes been overwhelmed, leaving the court angry or in tears, as they felt their voices - and that of Alice - were not being heard. Now, Jane hopes the verdicts will bring major change to psychiatric care providers around the country. ""You need to do far, far better to stop failing those people who you have a duty of care to,"" she said after the verdict. Weeks earlier, in mid-March this year, the Figueiredos were living in a hotel room in central London. While folding their clothes, they spoke to the BBC during a break in the trial, which was already running months longer than expected. They had been living out of suitcases since the end of October, when court hearings began. Even before the pain of hearing evidence about their daughter's death, they said simply existing like this had been a huge challenge.  For the couple, it was important to be at the Old Bailey every day in person - no matter the cost - because they felt this was their only chance to see the Trust held to account for their daughter's death. Alice was born in 1992, the second of three daughters. She was a bright and energetic child, and often the centre of attention. She loved music, poetry, reading and, in particular, art. Family and friends say she had a big personality. ""She had a really deeply thoughtful, sensitive, caring nature. She was really kind. She was really generous,"" remembers Jane. As a child, Alice started to develop what became an eating disorder, and by 15 she was showing symptoms of severe depression and was admitted to a mental health unit. In the following years she would be hospitalised on many more occasions. In 2012, then 19, she was admitted to the Hepworth Ward, at Goodmayes Hospital, for the first time. It is an inpatient mental health unit for women, run by NELFT. She was admitted there a total of seven times over the following three years. ""She needed safety. She was a risk to herself,"" says Jane. ""It was a question of, somehow managing the crisis and trusting the medical profession to make the right decisions,"" adds Max, Alice's stepfather. Between admissions, Alice had long periods when hospital treatment wasn't needed. She had been applying to go to university and was planning a brighter future. But on 13 February 2015, as her mental health took a serious turn for the worse, Alice was admitted to the Hepworth Ward for what would prove to be the final time. Three days later, Alice was detained on the unit under section three of the Mental Health Act to undergo treatment for her own safety and could not leave without her consultant's permission. Alice was put on one of the highest observation levels, reserved for patients at most risk of harming themselves. It meant a member of staff had to stay within arm's length of her 24-hours-a-day. In a letter to staff just over a month into her admission, Max and Jane wrote: ""She cannot contain the sense of sheer torment, intense depression and overwhelming despair she is experiencing."" The manager for Hepworth Ward at the time was Benjamin Aninakwa. The now 53-year-old had been working on the unit since it opened, in 2011. He was in charge of the unit during each of Alice's previous admissions, so knew her well. But other things on the ward had changed. The nurse and the consultant, who had previously cared for Alice, had both moved on and there was a high level of temporary agency staff filling long-standing gaps in the rota. Her parents say Alice felt unsettled. ""I think it became clear that there was an element of chaos in the ward,"" says Max. Jane, who was a chaplain to the mental health trust, would visit Alice every day; Max, who worked for the NHS as an accountant, would stop by a few times a week, often with food. Alice told her parents that staff weren't carrying out observations properly. On one occasion, within the first fortnight of her admission, she said an agency health care assistant who was supposed to be staying close to her, was instead making a phone call. The family later saw an internal email saying Alice had been left alone while the care worker continued this conversation. In that time, Alice attempted to harm herself using her bedding. The same email said that once the care assistant returned and found Alice she slapped her. ""Nothing was done about that. There was no safeguarding,"" says Jane. During the trial, the court heard that Alice had attempted to harm herself on at least 39 occasions during her admission - many of these involved plastic bags or bin liners. Even though they were in the dark about many of these incidents, her parents became so concerned they started raising it with staff at the hospital, in person and in several emails. On 16 May, three months into Alice's stay, Jane emailed the consultant for Hepworth Ward, Dr Anju Soni, about an incident of self-harm with a plastic bag in which Alice lost consciousness. ""If it had been a few minutes longer before she was found, the outcome could have been very different - she could have died,"" she wrote. The court heard that many of these incidents were not recorded properly by staff, nor communicated to the family. After several months, Alice's depression began to ease. In June, her observation levels were lowered to reflect her progress, and they were eventually reduced to hourly checks. She was able to leave the unit for short periods, even going to a Fleetwood Mac concert with her boyfriend Andrew. But her eating disorder remained a serious challenge, and she was still under section. She asked to be moved to a specialist unit to help her recovery. On 30 June, Alice complained of chest pain and was transferred to nearby King George Hospital. When she came back to Hepworth Ward a couple of days later, the court heard she was told she was too frail to go on planned leave. Her family remember intense fluctuations in her mood around this time. They say she was frustrated that her eating disorder wasn't improving, little progress was being made on her moving to another unit and she was getting bullied by other patients on the ward. On 4 July, three days before Alice died, Jane and Max went to visit her. The eating disorder was taking its toll. They could see their daughter was struggling. ""She sat there almost in silence, tears were rolling down her face,"" remembers Jane. Late on the night of 6 July, Alice and her boyfriend exchanged messages with each other, talking about their love of Bob Dylan's music. At 23:30 he wrote: ""I can't stop thinking about you, x."" The court heard that around that time Alice had asked to speak to a care assistant she got on with. The care assistant was called away to an emergency elsewhere in the hospital. When she returned to Hepworth Ward she looked for Alice. She eventually found her slumped in the communal toilet. Errors by two nurses on duty on Hepworth Ward slowed the arrival of an on-call doctor and paramedics. Alice was eventually taken to another hospital where she died. ""It's a moment where your entire life has changed and will never be the same. That's what we have had to learn to live with,"" says Jane. Still dealing with the devastating shock of losing their daughter, the Figueiredos set about piecing together what had happened to her. The Trust produced a Serious Incident (SI) report. These investigations are meant to help prevent similar incidents happening. But the Figueiredos felt it was incomplete and the Trust was avoiding accepting responsibility for Alice's death. Whatever their concerns, the report contained information that was new and troubling. It mentioned 13 incidents in which Alice had used a plastic bag or bin bag to self-harm. ""I was shocked and horrified when I saw that,"" says Jane. ""I thought, [the Trust] knew this had happened, and [they] still let her carry on doing this, and she died,"" she says. The family felt the risk of plastic bags for patients on an acute mental health ward, particularly Alice, should have been obvious. During a previous admission to Hepworth Ward the year before, Alice tried to harm herself using plastic bags on at least three occasions. In November 2015, sensing there was more to uncover, the couple holed themselves up in a hotel in Lindisfarne, off the Northumbria coast, and started piecing together their suspicions. ""We went very quickly into actually writing our own report and sending it to all the authorities that we knew of,"" says Max. They used their insiders' knowledge from working in the health service, to get their report in front of senior NHS people and regulators. They wrote to Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, then head of London's Metropolitan Police. He wrote back and a police investigation into what happened to Alice was launched. The Nursing and Midwifery Council launched inquiries into several of the nurses involved in Alice's care. Even with the police involved, the Figueiredos kept digging, getting hold of as much documentation as they possibly could. When they weren't able to get documents through official routes, they'd find other ways to get them, working like seasoned investigators. Once they had them, they'd analyse them and produce detailed reports that they sent to the police and regulators. ""If I could discover something that would be helpful to their investigation. I would try to do that. We were a parallel investigation,"" says Jane. All this digging came at a financial cost. ""We were in our 50s, we both stopped working and actually sold our house and lived off that to be able to do this,"" says Jane. The emotional price was even higher. ""You can't underestimate or even find the words to say, the toll that that takes on you. It's profoundly re-traumatising,"" she says. There were further shocks to come in Alice's medical notes, which showed gaps in the hospital's official SI report. They had been told Alice had attempted to self-harm with plastic bags on 13 occasions, in fact it happened at least 18 times. Most of these incidents weren't recorded in logs as they should have been. ""It still shocks us to the core today,"" says Max. On the unit, plastic bags were not used in the bins in patient bedrooms for safety reasons, but they were in a few communal locations, including a toilet that was often left unlocked. Alice used these bags to self-harm on multiple occasions, including the incident that led to her death. The trial heard there was little evidence that ward manager Benjamin Aninakwa made any attempt to restrict access to those bin bags, despite the issue being raised with him, and it appearing in Alice's care plan. He did not appear as a witness in court but told police the toilet door was locked and he had been overruled when he tried to remove the bin bags. The court heard there were no emails or evidence in Alice's clinical notes and records to corroborate this. A Care Quality Commission inspection in April 2016, the year after Alice's death, found bin bags still being used on the unit. The bags were eventually removed. The court heard that around the time Alice was admitted to the hospital for the final time, the Trust was carrying out a ""scoping exercise"", which looked at removing all plastic bin bags from the hospital's wards. It was revealed a bin which didn't need a plastic liner had been considered – it would have cost just £1.26. ""NELFT placed more value on their rubbish bins than they did on my daughter's life,"" says Jane. In a statement, the Trust said: ""Our thoughts are with Alice's family and loved ones, who lost her at such a young age. We extend our deepest sympathy for the pain and heartbreak they have suffered this past 10 years. ""We will reflect on the verdict and its implications, both for the trust and mental health provision more broadly as we continue to work to develop services for the communities we serve."" Jane and Max Figueiredo say they wanted to hold those at the Trust to account, but that they also wanted change for the future. But there will be no celebration at Monday's verdicts. ""Nothing will ever bring Alice back to us and we will never stop thinking of her and missing her,"" says Jane. ""There's always one place empty at our table, one very special voice silent that we long to hear in our conversations.""

6/10/2025,Article,Catherine visits behind the scenes at museum stores,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/c0k3lz67y0lo,"The Princess of Wales has visited the Victoria and Albert Museum's storehouse in East London, seeing a project that wants to make the museum's huge collection available to a wider range of people. The museum, which has its main building in South Kensington, has more than 600,000 objects in newly-opened store rooms at the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park. Catherine had a behind-the-scenes tour, where she praised how the public will be able to get a closer view of more of the museum's historic items. The V&A East Storehouse is a purpose-built arts storage centre, intended to widen access and ""unlock"" the collection of art, design and fashion items, much of which is not usually on display. ""What a fantastic idea to have all these pieces to learn from - so they're not just behind the scenes and stored away somewhere. You can see them in person and up close,"" said Catherine. ""What an opportunity for everyone to see historic pieces first hand,"" she said, praising the ""eclectic"" collection. Catherine was shown around the store's cavernous rooms by the museum's director Tristram Hunt and she saw examples of conservation work on textiles in the collection. Mr Hunt showed the princess some examples of textiles by the Victorian designer, William Morris, and she said how much she liked the foliage design. She spoke to the museum director about how some of the historic textiles on show could still look contemporary. The museum stores, free to visitors, has an ""order an object"" service which allows visitors to book an appointment to see an object close up and get information about it from museum staff. According to royal sources, the purpose of the visit was to highlight the importance of creative opportunity and to celebrate the ""power of creativity"".

6/10/2025,Article,Ed Sheeran says he identifies culturally as Irish,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/cn84e5xe4q3o,"Singer-songwriter Ed Sheeran has said he identifies culturally as Irish despite being born and raised in England. Brought up in Suffolk, the Galway Girl singer's dad hails from Belfast. ""I class my culture as Irish. I think that's what I grew up with,"" he told The Louis Theroux Podcast. ""My dad's family is... he's got seven brothers and sisters. We'd spend all of our holidays in Ireland. My first musical experiences were in Ireland, I grew up with trad music in the house. So I identify culturally as Irish, but I was obviously born and raised in Britain.""  ""I don't overthink it but I do feel like my culture is something that I'm really proud of and grew up with and want to express,"" he added. ""And I feel like just because I was born in Britain doesn't necessarily mean that I have to just be (British), there's loads of people I know that are half this or quarter this."" He added: ""I don't think there's any rules to it. It should be how you feel and how you were raised and what you lean into."" Asked if he gets ""a lot of love"" in Ireland, he said: ""I'd say it's basically my second home, musically. I'd say Ireland is the place that I am most successful musically.""  Sheeran is married to Cherry Seaborn and the couple have two children. He also spoke to Theroux about the difficulties of fame and having to have security for his family. He said that for him personally, ""it's kind of the part of the normal of being in the public eye"" but that is was different when it came to his wife and children. ""I'm very, very private about my children's image... I can't take them to zoos or parks or anything really without someone trying to film them. ""There are times where the normal parts of life I kind of mourn for and wish I could push my kid on a swing in a public park and it not be weird, you know?"" He said: ""People go, well that's the trade-off. But my kids have not signed up to that."" He added it was sometimes tricky when he was flying as he usually travels on commercial flights due to environmental concerns. ""We're flying back on Ryanair from a gig in Italy last year but all of my fans who'd been at the gig were flying back! ""I like the environment, I like trees. I'd find it hard to justify. No one's perfect. When we're doing intense promo trips, there will be the odd time [taking a private jet]"", he told Theroux.  Speaking about his music, Sheeran said: ""The two joys of my life professionally are writing songs and performing. I hate releasing music. I find the whole process quite stressful. ""You love the songs so much and then suddenly you're putting them out there, and that might change your relationship with them if other people don't like them. And I'm trying my hardest not to let that happen."" He also mused on his relationship with success. ""I kind of feel I had my peak with [the album] Divide and I'm kind of coasting now. I don't know if I'll ever get back up there again but [when I had] that level of fame, that was my unhappiest [time]. ""I'm much happier with the balance I've got now."" After releasing two acoustic albums in 2023, Sheeran's upcoming pop album, Play, his eighth studio album, will be released in September. Copyright 2025 BBC.

6/10/2025,Article,Despair to delight: lost Rodin 'copy'  sells for $1m,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/c2d5wl90x8xo,"A small marble sculpture thought to be a copy of the French artist Auguste Rodin's work has turned out to be the real thing, selling for almost $1m at an auction in France on Monday. The sculpture, called ""Despair"", a figure of a woman hugging her knees and holding one foot, is a work by the famed sculptor from 1892 that had disappeared after being sold at an auction in 1906. For the owners, ""Despair"" turned to delight when the piece they believed to be a Rodin copy was confirmed as authentic by the Comite Rodin after a six-week probe. French auctioneer Aymeric Rouillac described it as an ""extremely rare"" find and the work was put up for auction and eventually sold for €860,000 (£725,000; $982,000). ""Despair"" was originally modelled by Rodin as part of his series of figures for The Gates of Hell. According to the Musée Rodin, the figure is a depiction of sorrow and the French sculptor created other versions after it was positively received. After the family who owned the 28.5cm (11 inches) marble figure – which had sat on their piano for years – approached Mr Rouillac, he and his team spent months investigating the origins of the piece. In March, Mr Rouillac brought the piece to the Comité Rodin, a research group dedicated to studying the works of Rodin, who confirmed its authenticity six weeks later. The committee found that ""Despair"" had disappeared after being sold at an auction in 1906. ""We have rediscovered it,"" Mr Rouillac told the AFP news agency.  Copyright 2025 BBC.

6/11/2025,Article,'Un-American' or 'necessary'? Voters divided on Trump's LA protest crackdown,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/cj93x2egd0jo,"US President Donald Trump has sent thousands of National Guard troops and hundreds of US Marines to Los Angeles as protests take place against the administration's ramped-up immigration enforcement.  While the president's allies cheer him on, both the governor of California and the mayor of Los Angeles say Trump is overstepping his authority and stoking tensions. Everyday Americans are no less divided over the issue. But do they feel it is the president or the protesters who have gone too far?  Here's what six voters had to say about the news.  This Indiana man worries about the precedent Trump is setting by sending the National Guard into Los Angeles. I've seen some different takes on the legality of it, but it feels to me like the federal government is being very, very heavy-handed on this, which is concerning to me since protest is a protected form of expression in this country.   I'm concerned that this sets Americans against Americans, and specifically American military against American citizens.   The Trump administration is going about [the ICE raids] in an interesting manner... While making unilateral raids like these, they're making a lot of mistakes and those mistakes are costing people their freedoms. [The Trump administration] is not admitting to their mistakes and they're not following due process. We have laws in this country for a reason. This Mexico-born Texas resident - a naturalised US citizen - supports the deployment of troops to put down ""shameful"" protests in California. It's a shame that people who have come to this country to set themselves up are doing this, the riots. I tend to think that many of the rioters are people with criminal histories. Violent protesters.  People that want to be here to create a future and have a family in this generous country would not be doing that. Many are even waving Mexican flags. That's so shameful. I respect the president in so many ways. He is a guy who knows how to get things done. He's the law-and-order president. What was he supposed to do? Let them burn trash? Let them destroy Los Angeles? This California woman is distraught over what she sees in Los Angeles and an ""attack"" on immigrants by the Trump administration.  When I saw they called on the National Guard, I just started crying because he's weaponising everything he possibly can. There's no free speech, there's no dissent - it's Hitler's playbook all over again.  It's heartbreaking, really.  I just feel for the people he's targeting. It's wrong, it's so un-American. It's so against what this country was founded for.  I'm just shocked. I probably shouldn't be, but I just can't believe it's happening. I can't believe the military and the National Guard are supporting this. This Indiana man wants the violence to stop, but also worries about what deploying the military in response to protests means for the future. This goes far beyond just protest, in my view. This is an attack on our sovereignty and our civil society. We can debate immigration policy, but violence and chaos should not be tolerated.  [But Trump is] the one who's going to push the envelope to the legal limit, and if he can get by with more, he will, I think.  That's one of my concerns about this whole thing. I'm not 100% on board with it, but at the same time, I think something has to be done. It's not getting taken care of.  My trepidation is about precedent...I feel like everything we do, when we set new precedents, it will become new norms and not the exception. This Nebraska woman says she's likely to get involved with protests happening in her town because she's upset with what she sees Trump doing in LA. When watching clips, I saw some mostly peaceful protests. It seems like Trump is just mad that they're happening, rather than trying to prevent them from being violent.  More and more, he's become a president who uses his power to enforce his will [rather] than the will of the people.  I wonder to what extent is he going to keep doing this.  It's extremely valid that people are protesting ICE, because in all honesty there is very little proof of due process for people who have been taken by ICE and wrongfully detained.  A 29-year veteran of the US Army who retired as a colonel, this Texan - from the overwhelmingly Latino Rio Grande City on the border - believes that it is the protests that have gone too far. When state and local governments fail to support federal law - in this case deportation orders - the military deployment is necessary to protect lives, property and the movement of commerce. The protesters are blocking major highways, disrupting commerce, destroying and burning police cars, and interfering with police orders to disperse in certain areas. Everyone has the right to protest, but you don't have the right to make me or others listen to you. Creating violence so I can have your attention comes with consequences.

6/11/2025,Article,US tariff turmoil makes Spain's flagship foods seek other markets,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/cx2r1lp8e7go,"It's lunchtime in a bar in the southern Spanish city of Seville. The kitchen is humming with activity, and behind the bar a member of staff pours cold beer from a tap into a glass. Nearby, another uses a carving knife to cut slices from a large leg of jamón ibérico, or Iberian ham, placing each one on a plate, to be served as an appetiser. There are few more Spanish scenes. And there are few more Spanish products than jamón ibérico, whose unique salty flavour is renowned across the world, and part of a national cured ham industry worth nearly €750m ($850m; £630m) each year in exports. As he watches the jamón being carved, Jaime Fernández, international commercial director for the Grupo Osborne, which produces wine, sherry and the renowned Cinco Jotas brand of ham, describes it as a ""flagship"" national foodstuff. ""It's one of the most iconic gastronomic products from Spain,"" he says, pointing out how the pigs used to make the ham are reared in the wild and fed on acorns. ""It represents our tradition, our culture, our essence."" But jamón ibérico, like products across Spain and the rest of Europe, is facing the threat of trade tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump. There was no tariff on Spanish ham exports to the US until April of this year, when a 20% charge on all European imports was suddenly introduced, dropping to 10% pending negotiations. However, in May Trump unsettled European exporters again when he said that the tariff for all EU goods could rise as high as 50% if trade talks with Brussels do not come to a successful agreement. The current deadline for this is 9 July. ""The United States is one of our top, priority markets,"" says Mr Fernández. ""The uncertainty is there, and it complicates our medium-and long-term planning, investments and commercial development."" The tariffs, he adds, ""pose a threat to our industry."" Spain's overall economy is in rude health. The IMF has forecast growth this year of 2.5% – much higher than the other main EU economies – and unemployment is at a 17-year low. But the tariff issue comes as a blow for the country's pork industry, which represents more than 400,000 direct and indirect jobs, and is Europe's largest. Demand for cured ham in the US has grown substantially in recent years, and it has become the biggest importer of Spanish ham outside the EU. But the Spanish industry now faces the prospect of having to raise retail prices for US consumers and therefore losing competitivity to local products, or those not subject to the same tariffs. Spain's olive oil sector is in a similar quandary. The world's biggest producer of olive oil, Spain had set its sights on the US as a burgeoning market whose growth was driven by growing awareness of the health benefits of the product. Yet the the tariff turmoil comes just as Spanish producers and exporters have recovered from a drought that slashed harvests in the south of the country, and sent prices temporarily soaring. The US represents half of world olive oil consumption outside the EU. It is also the country whose imports of the foodstuff from Spain have grown the most in recent years, increasing from approximately 300,000 tonnes per year a decade ago to around 430,000 tonnes, says Rafael Pico Lapuente, director general of the Spanish association of olive oil exporters (ASOLIVA). Much will depend, he says, on the final tariff set for the EU. ""If there is a 10% tariff which is permanent, without differentiating between countries of origin, it's not going to create a distortion on the international market,"" says Mr Pico Lapuente. He explains that American consumers might have to absorb the extra cost. And although local US producers of olive oil or similar products would gain a competitive edge, their output is small enough for it not to concern the likes of Spain. However, he says it would be ""a different story"" if Trump introduced higher tariffs for the EU than for competitor olive oil countries outside the bloc – such as Turkey, the world's second-largest producer, or Tunisia, an emerging grower. That scenario, he says, would have a major impact on the world market and Spanish producers. But variations in tariffs between countries or trade blocs would also lead to a certain amount rule-bending and even chaos, according to Javier Díaz-Giménez, a professor of economics at the IESE business school in Madrid. He suggests two of Spain's direct neighbours as a hypothetical example. ""If Spain has a 20% tariff and Morocco and Andorra have a 10% tariff, all the Spanish products that can go through Morocco or Andorra… will do so."" He adds: ""They will be first exported to Morocco and Andorra and from there re-exported to the United States with a 10% tariff. ""And it's going to be really hard to make sure that these olives came from Andorra proper and not from Spain. Is Trump going to do something about that?"" For now, Spanish producers and exporters must hold their breath as EU negotiations take place with Washington. For Mr Pico Lapuente, a big cause of concern is the influence – or as he sees it, lack of influence – his sector wields within the European trade bloc. ""The negotiations representing the EU's 27 countries are carried out by Brussels,"" he says. ""In these negotiations, industrial products have a much bigger influence than food. ""I wouldn't like it if, in this negotiation, food products like olive oil were used as mere bargaining chips in order to get a better deal for Europe's industrial products. That worries me. And I hope it doesn't happen."" A spokesperson for the European Commission told the BBC that in negotiations with the US it will act ""in defence of European interests, protecting its workers, consumers and its industries"". Jaime Fernández, of the Grupo Osborne, believes his industry could live with the 10% tariff that is currently in place without suffering too much fallout. However, a 20% charge, he says would cause the industry ""to reconsider how to accelerate growth in some other markets, which would eventually lead to the relocation of resources from the US"". He says his company is already looking at alternative markets in which to invest, such as China, or proven European ham consumers such as France, Italy and Portugal. Mr Díaz-Giménez says that is the logical response to the current uncertainty. ""If I was the CEO of any company with a high exposure to the United States… I would have sent my entire sales team to find other markets,"" he says. ""And by now, they would have found them. There would be plan Bs and plan Cs, to make sure that we have reduced this exposure to the US."" Copyright 2025 BBC.

6/11/2025,Article,Elon Musk says he regrets some posts about Donald Trump,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/clyn4d33yyno,"Billionaire Elon Musk has said he regrets some of the posts he made about US President Donald Trump during their war of words on social media.  ""They went too far,"" he wrote on his social media platform X.  The two were embroiled in a public fallout after the Tesla owner stepped back from his White House role and called Trump's tax bill a ""disgusting abomination"".  His post comes after Trump said he was open to the possibility of reconciliation in an interview with the New York Post on Wednesday. The president said he was a ""little disappointed"" about the fallout, but there were ""no hard feelings"". ""I think he feels very badly that he said that,"" Trump said of Musk's blistering social media barrage.  The budget, which includes huge tax breaks and more defence spending, was passed by the House of Representatives last month and is now being considered by senators. Musk urged Americans to call their representatives in Washington to ""kill the bill"" as he believed it would ""cause a recession in the second half of the year"". The tech entrepeneur claimed, without evidence, that Trump appears in unreleased government files linked to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The White House rubbished those claims. In response, Trump said Musk had ""lost his mind"" and threatened to cancel his government contracts, which have an estimated value of $38bn (£28bn). A significant chunk of that goes to Musk's space technology company SpaceX. ""I think it's a very bad thing, because he's very disrespectful. You could not disrespect the office of the president,"" Trump said in an interview with NBC on Sunday.  Musk appeared to have deleted many of his posts over the weekend, including one calling for Trump's impeachment. Musk was the largest donor for Trump's 2024 presidential campaign and had been considered the president's right-hand man.  Former Trump aide Steve Bannon called for Musk, who was born in South Africa, to be deported. US Vice-President JD Vance said he hoped that ""eventually Elon comes back into the fold"" but that it might be difficult considering he went ""nuclear"".  Most Republicans have called for the two men to reconcile, while Democrats have watched on as the feud unfolded. Their fallout came shortly after Musk left the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge), after just 129 days in the job. Copyright 2025 BBC.

6/11/2025,Article,Who has been arrested by ICE under Trump?,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/c86p821p660o,"On the campaign trail, Donald Trump was crystal clear: ""On day one, I will launch the largest deportation programme of criminals in the history of America."" That promise, opinion polls suggested, proved broadly popular with the American people, including with legal immigrants, who felt that too many people were coming into the country the ""wrong way"". Since taking office, the president has widened the scope of his mission, targeting not just criminals, but migrant workers, some student activists and even tourists with visa issues. For almost five months, these moves met little resistance. But now parts of Los Angeles have erupted in protests after immigrations officers intensified their raids at workplaces. But who are the migrants caught up in these raids? And who else has the administration targeted? Here's a look at some of the people who have already been targeted. Since assuming office, the president has touted plummeting numbers of border crossings and record arrests under his administration. About 51,000 undocumented migrants were in Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention as of early June - the highest on record since September 2019.  While accurate and up-to-date figures for the total number of immigration detentions since 20 January are not publicly available, White House officials have said they hope ICE can scale up to 3,000 arrests a day, from 660 or so during the first 100 days of Trump's presidency.  Initially, US officials insisted that the operations were ""targeted"" at criminals and potential public safety threats. But a significant number of undocumented migrants detained by the Trump administration have otherwise clean records, according to one data tracker.  The Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse - a project from Syracuse University that compiles immigration figures - estimates that of the 51,302 people in ICE detention facilities as of 1 June, about 44% had no criminal record aside from entering the US without permission. The unrest in Los Angeles was sparked by a series of immigration arrests that netted a total of 118 people, which the Department of Homeland Security said included five gang members. ICE has characterised those arrested in LA as ""the worst of the worst"". The agency identified a handful of people with criminal histories, including drug trafficking, assault, cruelty to children, domestic violence, robbery and alien smuggling. How many of the total have criminal histories, however, is unclear.  The parents of a 23-year-old undocumented migrant, a member of Mexico's indigenous Zapotec community, told the Washington Post their son, who they said has no criminal history, was detained outside a clothing store. The BBC cannot independently confirm the details of this case. Border tsar Tom Homan has justified these arrests as ""collateral"" damage, arguing that agents cannot legally justify encountering undocumented immigrants and not detaining them.  There have been several instances of tourists being arrested and held in detention centres, including British, European and Canadian citizens.  In April, for example, a 28-year-old Welsh tourist was held for 19 days in an ICE processing centre in Washington state after being denied entry to Canada over what she later termed a ""visa mix-up"".  In another more recent incident in June, 25-year-old Italian citizen Khaby Lame - the world's most popular TikTok star with 162m followers - was detained at Las Vegas' airport for ""immigration violations"".  ICE alleged that Mr Lame overstayed the terms of his visa after having entered the country on 30 April. Authorities later said he was granted ""voluntary departure"" and left the country.  Additionally, in March, Canadian actress Jasmine Mooney was held for nearly two weeks after being detained at the San Ysidro border crossing, where she was attempting to renew her visa to enter the US.  She later described the conditions of her detention as inhumane, and described being kept in a concrete cell with no blanket and limited bathrooms. She was later released without being charged with any crime.  Her case caught the attention of British Columbia Premier David Eby, who said the incident further inflamed Canadian anxieties about traveling to the US.  ""The nature of our relationship is so fraught right now that this case makes us all wonder, what about our relatives who are working in the States?"" he said in a statement to CBC.  Others, like 34-year-old German national Fabian Schmidt, were held at airports.  Schmidt, who had lived in the US since 2007, was detained on his way into the US from Luxembourg.  In an interview with WGBH, a New Hampshire news outlet, Mr Schmidt said he was asked about a drug misdemeanour charge that was later dismissed and a later DUI that resulted in fines and probation. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has largely avoided commenting on specific cases, but has repeatedly insisted it is operating lawfully. Some of the most striking images of the Trump administration's immigration overhaul have come from thousands of miles away, in the Central American nation of El Salvador. There, over 250 people who the government claims are members of the gang Tren de Aragua have been transferred to a mega-prison.  Family members of some of those men, however, have disputed any gang ties, with some arguing that they were swept up as a result of innocent tattoos.  Dubbed ""alien enemies"", they were removed under a 1798 act that gives authorities sweeping powers to order the detention and deportation of natives or citizens of an ""enemy"" nation.  ""It is really disheartening,"" Adalys Ferro, the executive director of the Venezuelan-American Caucus, an advocacy group, told the BBC. ""All of these decisions are inhumane, cruel and also illegal.""  The most high-profile case is that of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a 29-year-old from El Salvador and Maryland resident who was deported from the US in March.  Various judges - including those on the US Supreme Court - have ruled that Mr Abrego Garcia was deported in error and that the government should ""facilitate"" his return to the US and his family.  On 6 June, he was returned to the US to face federal criminal charges after being charged in an indictment alleging he illegally transported undocumented migrants while still in the US.  Foreign nationals who participate in political protests have also found themselves in the administration's crosshairs, despite some having permanent residency or valid student visas in the US.  Anthony Enriquez, who leads advocacy efforts at Robert F Kennedy Human Rights, a non-profit human rights organisation, told the BBC that there have been ""more and more"" green card holders detained since Trump returned to office. ""Immigration authorities feel empowered to conduct arrests that they're legally not allowed to do,"" he said. Although the reasons for the decisions vary, over 1,600 international students have had their visas revoked, according to Nafsa, an organisation that focuses on international education. Many of the arrests follow the White House's crackdown on what it has classified as antisemitism on US campuses, including the arrest of Mahmoud Khalil, a prominent figure during Gaza war protests at Columbia University last year.  The 30-year-old green card holder has been fighting to stop his deportation in court.  Tufts University student Rumeysa Ozturk also spent six weeks in custody before being released. The university later said that it had been told that Ms Ozturk - a doctorate candidate who participated in pro-Palestinian protests - had had her student visa revoked. She continues to fight her deportation in court. While these cases have been subject to fierce criticism, ICE has justified some of the arrests by saying that the students participated in activities ""aligned"" to Hamas.  ""A visa is a privilege not a right,"" US Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said in a post on X.  Copyright 2025 BBC.

6/11/2025,Article,Which other US cities have joined LA's protests?,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/cj09604yrpzo,"Protests have spread across America following days of demonstrations in Los Angeles against immigration raids by the federal government. Thousands of troops and hundreds of marines have been deployed to LA by US President Donald Trump to quell the demos, causing a row with state politicians. Days of unrest were sparked after federal immigration officers arrested large groups of unauthorised immigrants in areas with large Latino populations. Rallies have since taken place from coast to coast, with more planned over the coming days. Texas Governor Greg Abbott ordered the state's National Guard to deploy to San Antonio on Tuesday, ahead of planned demonstrations. He wrote on X: ""Peaceful protest is legal. Harming a person or property is illegal & will lead to arrest."" In Austin, hundreds of protesters gathered on Monday between the state capitol building and a federal building that houses an office for staff of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).  State and local police used pepper spray and tear gas to disperse the crowd, while bottles, rocks and other objects were thrown towards officers. Demonstrators have also gathered in Dallas - where at least one arrest was made after protesters clashed with police - and in Houston. Thousands of protestors gathered in lower Manhattan on Tuesday.  Thirty-four people were arrested and charged, the New York City Police Department (NYPD) told the BBC. A further 52 people were detained and issued with court summonses after the largely peaceful protests. Mayor Eric Adams said protests like those in LA were ""unacceptable and will not be tolerated if attempted in our city"". LA is not the only Californian city that has been demonstrating. Thousands of people have protested in San Francisco - and more than 150 were arrested after a demonstration near another ICE office turned violent on Sunday. Buildings and vehicles were damaged, according to local police, while two officers were injured in the disorder. And on Tuesday, some 200 protesters gathered outside the San Francisco Immigration Court after activists said several arrests were made there. Hundreds of protestors gathered in downtown Santa Ana, also in California, on Monday - after reports of ICE raids in the city that morning. The gathering descended into violence. Federal authorities used tear gas to disperse the crowd, while local police said protesters had thrown fireworks, rocks and bottles towards officers. Congresswoman Lou Correa said the problems were caused not ""by us but by the federal government coming into our community"". Thousands gathered near an immigration court in the city before marching through the city's downtown on Tuesday evening. A car sped through the crowd at around 18:19 local time (23:19 GMT) and narrowly missed the demonstrators, according to the BBC's US partner CBS News. The vehicle appeared to be travelling at 50mph (80 km/h) at one point, a witness said. No injuries were immediately reported.  Police also clashed with protesters and several arrests were made. Fireworks were thrown towards police and tear gas used to disperse protestors in Atlanta on Monday, according to local media, as hundreds gathered along the city's Buford Highway on Tuesday. At least six people were arrested. At least 15 people were arrested after around 150 protestors gathered in Philadelphia on Tuesday, according to CBS. Local police said the crowd disrupted traffic and ""endangered public safety"". Several officers used force when making arrests, they added, saying this would be reviewed. Several unions gathered in the US capital on Monday, marching past the Department of Justice (DoJ) building. They rallied against the detainment of union leader David Huerta during the raids in LA on Friday. He was released from federal custody later on Monday. Hundreds gathered outside Boston City Hall on Monday, similarly calling for Huerta's release. The following day, hundreds marched through the city to the Massachusetts State House.  Around 50 people gathered outside Seattle's immigration court on Tuesday. Some tried to block vehicle access to the building using e-bikes and e-scooters.

6/11/2025,Article,What is the Insurrection Act?,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/c9qwez9zz7jo,"On his first day back in the White House, President Donald Trump signed an executive order declaring an emergency at the US southern border and directed his top officials to evaluate whether to invoke a rarely used 19th-century law to respond to that emergency. The Insurrection Act of 1807 allows the president to use active-duty military personnel to perform law-enforcement duties inside the US.  The law has recently come up again, as Trump sends National Guard troops and Marines to the immigration-related protests in downtown Los Angeles, which he describes as violent, over the objections of the mayor and California governor. ""If there's an insurrection, I would certainly invoke it,"" Trump said on Tuesday. ""We'll see."" Here's what to know. The 19th-century law would allow the use of active-duty military personnel to perform law-enforcement duties within the US. US presidents can invoke the law if they determine that ""unlawful obstructions, combinations, or assemblages, or rebellion"" against the government make it ""impracticable to enforce"" US law ""by the ordinary course of judicial proceedings"".  Once invoked, troops could be tasked with a range of duties, from quelling civil unrest and enforcing court orders to arresting and detaining migrants. This includes the National Guard - a branch of the US armed forces traditionally reserved for domestic emergencies and disasters.  Because the Insurrection Act was written in broad terms, with little specific guidance on how and when the powers can be used, it gives presidents wide latitude in deciding when to mobilise military personnel for domestic operations. Throughout his election campaign, Trump vowed to crackdown on illegal immigration, calling the southern border situation a ""national emergency"" that could be better tamed by invoking the 19th-century statute. On his first day in office in January, he asked for ""recommendations regarding additional actions that may be necessary to obtain complete operational control of the southern border, including whether to invoke the Insurrection Act of 1807"". The administration has already rolled out a series of sweeping measures targeting the border. These include a nationwide deportation sweep and the controversial move to transfer alleged Venezuelan gang members to a prison in El Salvador - a decision now facing legal challenges. This comes as US Border Patrol has recorded just 8,300 migrant apprehensions, marking the lowest number of border crossings since 2000.  The Insurrection Act has been invoked a handful of times in American history.  Abraham Lincoln used it when the southern states rebelled during the US Civil War, and former President Ulysses S Grant invoked it against a wave of racist violence by the Ku Klux Klan after the war. In the 20th century, former President Dwight D Eisenhower invoked it so the US Army would escort black students into their high school in Little Rock, Arkansas, after the state's governor refused to comply with a federal desegregation order. More recently, it was used in 1992 when massive riots broke out in Los Angeles over the acquittal of four white police officers in the beating of Rodney King, a black man. Then-President George Bush sent in active-duty members of the Marines and Army as well as National Guard troops. The US government has traditionally worked to limit the use of military force on American soil, especially against its own citizens. The Posse Comitatus Act of 1878 was enacted to restrict the military from acting as domestic law enforcement. In times of unrest, states typically deploy the National Guard themselves to help maintain order. Since returning to office, Trump has expanded his authority by declaring national emergencies - which gives the president access to powers and resources that are normally restricted. He has used this authority to impose tariffs and, more controversially, to take action on immigration. In March, following his emergency declaration at the border, Trump invoked the rarely used Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to deport migrants he alleged were gang members.  In April, the Supreme Court temporarily blocked that effort. If Trump chooses to invoke the Insurrection Act, it remains unclear what legal challenges he might face. Copyright 2025 BBC.

6/11/2025,Article,Solved after 47 years: The mystery of the North Sea message in a bottle,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/ckgxwg4738eo,"The mystery of a North Sea message in a bottle found on a Swedish island after 47 years has been solved by BBC Scotland News. Friends Ellinor Rosen Eriksson and Asa Nilsson found the washed-up bottle earlier this year. The damp and faded letter was hard to read, but they were able to make out the name Addison Runcie, the year 1978, and an address in Cullen, Banffshire. It has now been established the letter referred to fisherman James Addison Runcie who had been on board the fishing boat Loraley, but who died in 1995. It was written by his then crewmate Gavin Geddes - who was amazed to be told it had been found 47 years after they dropped it overboard. The two finders in Sweden said it was ""fantastic"" the mystery of the source had been solved, and Jim's sister described the story unfolding as ""amazing"". Ellinor, 32, and Asa, 55, found the bottle on Sweden's west coast back in February. ""I was out exploring the Vaderoarna islands with my best friend Asa,"" Ellinor said. ""We both love searching for beach finds, and that day we took the boat out to Torso, the northernmost island in the archipelago. ""Deep in the bushes on the island, Asa spotted something unusual - a thick glass bottle sticking out of the ground."" Inside was a damp note that was almost unreadable. They laid it out in the sun to dry, and were eventually able to make out some text. The full date appeared to be: ""14.9.78"". They could also make out the name and address  ""Addison Runcie, Seatown, Cullen, Banffshire, Scotland"". Ellinor said they were ""completely amazed"" to find a ""real message in a bottle"", and hoped to discover the story behind it. They posted about it on social media in the hope of learning more. On closer inspection, the letters ""es"" could also be made out before Addison Runcie, as well as the number 115 before the address. BBC Scotland News then established that James Addison Runcie had lived at that Seatown address in Cullen at the time - the ""es"" was the end of James - and started to investigate more.  Jane Worby, 78, who now lives at the house, described it as ""nice to have a little bit of history"" when told of the story. ""It does catch the imagination,"" she said of the message in a bottle. ""It almost makes me want to do it myself."" Jim Runcie - who was known locally as Peem - died in 1995 at the age of 67. The story took an unexpected twist when we spoke to Gavin Geddes, one of Jim's former crewmates on the Buckie-registered Loraley, which sailed out of Peterhead. ""As soon as I saw the letter I thought that is definitely my writing,"" Gavin, 69, said. Gavin, who lives a few miles from Cullen in Rathven, said he remembered writing it, and even compared his own hand-writing to confirm it. They had put a ""couple of bottles"" overboard, and had wanted one to be from Jim Runcie. ""We put one away for Jim - and now that's the only one found in 47 years,"" he said. ""Now at least we got one reply."" Mr Runcie's sister Sandra Taylor, 83, happened to be visiting Cullen where she is originally from, and was stunned to be told the story behind the find in Sweden. ""It's absolutely amazing,"" she said. ""To be bobbing around in the sea for 40-odd years and then just all of a sudden go onto the shore, it's unbelievable. ""The name and address means it was definitely him. ""All my family were in fishing, and it was never going to be anything but the sea for Jim. He was a fisherman all his life.""  Asked what she thought her older brother would have made of it all, she said: ""He would have been in stitches, he would find it hard to believe. ""He would have poured out a dram and said 'cheers'."" Back in Sweden, Ellinor and Asa described finding out where the message came from as meaning the world to them. ""This is such a cosy and fantastic story,"" Ellinor said. ""Finding a message in a bottle from someone far away, on a freezing February day, far out on a remote island with your best friend, that's truly magical."" She explained that if they had known how it would turn out, they would have tried to save the bottle itself too. ""I myself come from a fishing family and absolutely love the sea, spending time on the islands and searching for treasures,"" she said. ""Where I live, we call this activity vraga - it means going out to find something lost or hidden, and to uncover its story. And that's exactly what we've done here, with your amazing help."" Ellinor added: ""Asa and I would absolutely love to come to Cullen one day - to talk about the bottle and the story, and experience your beautiful coast and community. ""We are truly thrilled about this."" Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.  The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites. Read about our approach to external linking.  "
6/11/2025,Article,Pitbull says seeing fans dressed as him is priceless,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/cq85j7324lzo,"Pitbull is fascinated by his popularity in the UK - telling the BBC it makes him ""very, very happy"" to look out into the crowd and see thousands of people dressed like him, singing along to every word of his songs. Thanks to social media, it's become custom in recent months to attend a Pitbull show dressed as the star - in sunglasses, suit and a bald cap. ""Every time I'm at a show, I let them know that when you put on a bald cap, I hope you're ready to have the time of your lives - it feels deeper than just music,"" he says. The rapper and singer has recently returned to the UK for a second run of tour dates after a big reception from fans earlier in the year. The 44-year-old, real name Armando Christian Perez, has sold more than 25 million albums worldwide and 100 million singles. It's only during his most recent tours that people have been dressing as him en masse - something he says is ""an honour"". ""It's the ultimate trophy to be able to go on stage and see all the hard work that you put into the music. I've been in the game for 25 years and to see every demographic, everybody [dressing up] at the shows is priceless,"" he adds. Pitbull, whose parents are from Cuba, began his career in the Latin hip hop scene, taking inspiration from the musical influences of his hometown of Miami. His transition to pop began in the early 2010s, bringing with it chart success and collaborations with global artists such as Christina Aguilera, Usher and Shakira. Due to the emergence of streaming over radio plays, Spanish music has been able to thrive in countries where it's not a native language, something Pitbull has been able to use to his advantage. ""There's an irony as I'm kind of an anomaly in the music business,"" he says. ""In the Latin world they said I was too English, and in the English world I was too Latin, so to bring it together now, when it all really started around 2010, feels really good."" A section of Pitbull's setlist is dedicated to his favourite Spanish language songs and those from his own back catalogue. ""I now get the chance to merge the worlds together and to be able to hit the stage and see the power of music, no matter the language,"" he adds. Pitbull says it's a ""really powerful thing"" to have ""people coming up to me and say 'I learned Spanish due to your words'"".  Speaking to fans ahead of his O2 Arena show in London on Monday night, many said the nostalgia factor had inspired them to buy tickets, with Pitbull providing the soundtrack to important parts of their lives - like school trips and university nights out. ""My music gives that outlet, that escapism. It's like therapy,"" Pitbull says. His setlist for the tour was designed to get the party going, with tracks like Timber and Fireball causing a huge roar from the sea of bald caps. There was barely a moment to breathe - with Pitbull's several outfit changes punctuated by DJ sets that kept the momentum going. Overall, the show was a fun and light-hearted affair, with the music transporting the crowd back to happier times in the early 2010s. Pitbull says he doesn't ""worry about what the trends are"" or ""what's cool"" when putting his sets together and just wants people to have fun.  He didn't disappoint with his famous one-liners. There were plenty to enjoy during his set, including, ""This is for everyone going through tough times, been there done that, but everyday above ground is a great day"" and, ""Life is not a waste a time and time is not a waste of life. So let's stop wasting time and have the time of our life"".  Pitbull says: ""You don't know what a person is going through in their life, so I try to create phrases, which we grew up doing as Cubans. One-liners to help you out in any situation you're in,"" he says. The star says he's applied the same philosophy to the English language - creating the celebrated pop song lyrics that fans sang back to him all night long. Copyright 2025 BBC.

6/11/2025,Article,Iran executes man over 2022 anti-government protests,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/cj42jrjw8n1o,"A man has been executed in Iran, three years after he was arrested during the nationwide anti-government protests in 2022, the judiciary says. Mojahed Kourkouri, also known as Abbas Kourkouri, was sentenced to death after being convicted of armed attacks and membership of a ""rebellion group"", according to the judiciary's Mizan news agency.  He was accused of killing seven people, including nine-year-old Kian Pirfalak, during protests in the city of Izeh. Kian's family said he was killed by security forces, but authorities maintained that a ""rioter"" shot him.  Amnesty International said Kourkouri was subjected to torture and that his trial was ""grossly unfair"". Kourkouri is the 11th person known to have been executed in relation to the protests, which were sparked by the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old woman who was detained by morality police in Tehran in September 2022 for allegedly wearing her hijab ""improperly"". Hundreds of people were killed and thousands detained in a violent crackdown by security forces, which portrayed the protests as ""riots"". Kourkouri was accused of opening fire on a car carrying Kian Pirfalak and his family in Izeh, in the south-western province of Khuzestan, at the height of the unrest that November. State authorities blamed ""terrorist agents"" for Kian's killing, and later arrested Kourkouri during an armed raid the following month, during which Kourkouri was shot and injured in the knee, human rights groups said. Kian's family has repeatedly said it does not think Kourkouri was involved in the boy's killing. At Kian's funeral, the boy's mother was overheard in a video telling mourners: ""Hear it from me myself on how the shooting happened, so they can't say it was by terrorists, because they're lying.""  ""Plainclothes forces shot my child. That is it,"" Zeynab Molaei said. Later that the day, she appeared to recant the remarks in a state TV interview, warning that they should ""not be misused"". She looked visibly distressed, prompting many on social media to warn that she might have been coerced. The judiciary's announcement that Kourkouri had been executed sparked condemnation among human rights groups. Amnesty International said Kourkouri's trial was unfair because he had been denied access to an independently chosen lawyer and his confessions, which were broadcast on Iranian state media, had been forced. It added that following his arrest, Kourkouri was held in solitary confinement and repeatedly subjected to torture and other ill-treatment, including severe beatings. Kourkouri was initially sentenced in April 2023, but a judicial review of his case was filed to the Supreme Court in January 2024, Amnesty said. His conviction was later upheld and his sentence was sent for implementation later that year, it added. The director of the Oslo-based Iran Human Rights group, Mahmood Amiry-Moghaddam, said Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and Iran's other leaders ""must be held accountable for the extrajudicial killing"" of Kourkouri, ""as well as for the murders of Kian Pirfalak and thousands of other innocent people"". ""The international community must break its silence in the face of this tsunami of executions carried out by the Islamic Republic,"" he added. Kurdish human rights group Hengaw said at least 582 prisoners, including 19 political, religious, and security inmates, had been executed in Iranian prisons so far this year. The last person to be executed in connection with the 2022 protests was Reza Rasaei in August last year. The 34-year-old was sentenced to death in 2023 after what Amnesty called a ""grossly unfair"" trial that relied on forced confessions, which they said were ""obtained under torture and other ill-treatment, including beatings, electric shocks, suffocation and sexual violence"". Iranian authorities accused him of having a part in the death of a member of Iran's Revolutionary Guards during the protests - a charge Rasaei denied.

6/11/2025,Article,What joke made this class the funniest in Britain?,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/cd0l8vdmdvro,"Pupils at an east London primary school have been named ""Britain's funniest class"" by Beano magazine. Year 5 pupils in Stratus Class at Riverley Primary School in Leyton, were awarded the title for their joke submission to a UK-wide competition: ""What do you call the fanciest punctuation? An a-posh-trophe"". Mike Stirling, director of mischief at Beano said it was a ""perfectly crafted joke"" that had their team laughing out loud. The students and their teacher, Maisha Mahfuza, who was also named Britain's funniest teacher, were turned into artwork for The Beano comic by cartoonist Nigel Parkinson. Ms Mahfuza said: ""Seeing our class and joke featured in Beano was surreal.  ""Learning should always come with a healthy dose of fun."" The Beano competition was supported by children's mental health charity Place2Be.  Judges shortlisted the jokes into a top 10, which were put to a public vote. Fitzjohn's Primary School in Hampstead was also shortlisted with the joke: ""Gnasher tried to open a store. Business was ruff!""

6/11/2025,Article,Bodies of schoolchildren found after bus swept away by South Africa floods,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/ckgqwg9gej7o,"The search for schoolchildren swept away by floods in South Africa's Eastern Cape province has resumed after being halted overnight, officials have said. The children were on their way to school in the town of Mthatha when their bus was carried away in flood waters as it was crossing a bridge on Tuesday morning. A total of eight bodies, including that of the bus driver, have so far been recovered, Eastern Cape community safety official Xolile Nqatha has told private TV station Newzroom Afrika. Other officials said three students were rescued on Tuesday, but it was unclear how many pupils were on the bus, which has since been found on a riverbank with no-one inside. Public broadcaster SABC reported that the three children who were rescued were found clinging to trees.  On Wednesday morning, Eastern Cape Premier Oscar Mabuyane visited the scene to witness rescue efforts, and to meet affected communities. He told Newzroom Afrika that while the situation was a ""difficult one"", he was ""quite happy"" with the response of the emergency services. South Africa has been hit by heavy snow, rains and gale force winds that have officially claimed the lives of 14 people, nine from the floods and five in a road accident. Nearly 500,000 homes were left without electricity on Tuesday - and state-owned power provider Eskom says efforts are being made to restore connections. South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa has offered his condolences to the families of those who died as he urged citizens to ""display caution, care and cooperation as the worst impacts of winter weather take effect across the country"". The Eastern Cape - the birthplace of anti-apartheid icon Nelson Mandela - has been worst-affected by the icy conditions, along with KwaZulu-Natal province. The bad weather has forced the closure of some major roads in the two provinces to avoid further casualties. Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

6/3/2025,Article,Dutch government faces collapse as far-right leader exits coalition,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0r1x5yyd5wo,"The Dutch government has collapsed after Geert Wilders withdrew his far-right party from the governing coalition following a row over migration. Prime Minister Dick Schoof confirmed he was stepping down on Tuesday and offered the resignation of the cabinet to King Willem-Alexander. In televised remarks following an emergency cabinet meeting, Schoof said Wilders' decision to withdraw the support of his PVV party was ""irresponsible and unnecessary"".  ""As far as I'm concerned, this shouldn't have happened,"" he added. The governing coalition was in place for less than one year. The row which led to its collapse came after Wilders pushed for 10 additional asylum measures, including a freeze on applications, halting the construction of reception centres and limiting family reunification. Schoof had made a last-minute appeal to coalition party leaders on Tuesday morning, but the meeting lasted just one minute before Wilders walked out, ending the coalition. ""No signature for our asylum plans. PVV leaves the coalition,"" said Wilders on X. There was shock and anger among political leaders, many of whom pointed out that several of Wilders' demands were similar to policies already in the coalition agreement, and that they would not stand in the PVV's way to implement them. Many of the additional proposals put forward by Wilders had been dismissed during coalition talks because of  legal concerns. Wilders' decision has put an end to an uneasy governing coalition which was born in July 2024 after months of political wrangling following elections the previous year. His anti-immigration, far-right PVV was the largest party. The other members were the conservative-liberal VVD, the Farmers' Citizen Movement (BBB) and the centrist New Social Contract. From the start the coalition seemed a marriage of convenience, characterised by infighting and appeared to struggle to push through any of policies it had proudly promoted.  Following its collapse, Wilders' former coalition partners accused him of engineering the crisis. VVD leader Dilan Yesilgoz said the move was ""super irresponsible"", adding: ""This wasn't about asylum at all."" ""I think Wilders is betraying the Netherlands,"" said deputy Prime Minister Mona Keijzer from the BBB.  But Wilders appears to feel emboldened. On Tuesday he told reporters that he intended to become prime minister of the Netherlands ""and ensure that the PVV becomes bigger than ever in the next elections"". Sandra Phlippen, the chief economist for ABN AMRO bank, said the immediate economic impact of the cabinet's collapse appeared minimal because during its 11 months in office the government had ""barely made any concrete plans"".  Polls show the far right and Green-Left parties are neck-and-neck, with migration and cost-of-living issues fuelling political volatility across Europe.   Wilders wanted the government to collapse as the support for his Freedom Party continues to drop in the polls, according to Armida van Rij, the Head of the Europe Programme at Chatham House. With the Nato summit due to be held in the Hague at the end of the month, Schoof's ministers will seek to remain in power in a caretaker capacity until a date is set for the Netherlands to return to the polls - likely in the autumn, according to Dutch media. In the Dutch political system, becoming prime minister requires forming a majority coalition in the 150-seat parliament. Even if Wilders again surpasses the political pundits expectations, his decision to collapse the government is being seen as reckless - and perceptions he is putting personal ambition above national stability could further complicate his ability to form alliances after the next election.  The parties that were reluctant or refused to go into government with Wilders after the last election are likely to find that kind of partnership even less attractive now.  In addition, by toppling the coalition over the issue of asylum, it is likely Wilders will put it at the centre of his upcoming election campaign. However, given that his party had been responsible for asylum and immigration for almost a year, there are no guarantees that such a gamble will pay off. Copyright 2025 BBC.

6/3/2025,Article,Blake Lively drops two claims against Justin Baldoni,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62v5g81857o,"The actress Blake Lively has attempted to withdraw two of the claims she made about director Justin Baldoni. Both have been engaged in a legal dispute since Lively sued Baldoni in December 2024 after they worked together on the film It Ends With Us, accusing him of sexual harassment and a smear campaign. Baldoni's legal team asked Lively to release her medical records, including therapy notes, as part of its defence against her claims she suffered ""severe emotional distress and pain, humiliation, embarrassment"", Variety said.  Lively is trying to drop claims of intentional infliction of emotional distress and negligent infliction of emotional distress, the publication added.  The court will decide if it will dismiss the claims or compel Lively to hand over information related to her mental health. Variety approached Baldoni's lawyers, who have declined comment.  The BBC has also approached both parties for comment.  Documents filed by Baldoni's legal team on Monday said: ""Instead of complying with the Medical RFPs [Request for Proposal], Ms Lively's counsel recently advised us, in writing, that Ms Lively is withdrawing her [infliction of emotional distress] claims."" They wrote that Lively had refused their ""reasonable request that the withdrawal of such claims be with prejudice"" opening up the possibility they could be refiled.  Lively's lawyers told Variety Baldoni's filing was ""a press stunt"" and said her defence was ""streamlining and focusing"" her case. They added: ""The Baldoni-Wayfarer strategy of filing retaliatory claims has exposed them to expansive new damages claims under California law, rendering certain of Ms Lively's original claims no longer necessary.  ""Ms Lively continues to allege emotional distress, as part of numerous other claims in her lawsuit, such as sexual harassment and retaliation, and massive additional compensatory damages on all of her claims."" In January this year, Baldoni counter-sued Lively and her husband, the actor Ryan Reynolds, on claims of civil extortion, defamation and invasion of privacy. Lively and Baldoni have been locked in a dispute since It Ends With Us, which is an adaption of a best-selling Colleen Hoover novel, was released last summer. In the film Lively played the main character, Lily Bloom, a young woman who grew up witnessing domestic abuse, and winds up in the same position years later. The singer Taylor Swift had been summoned to a US court last month, after it was alleged she encouraged Baldoni to accept script rewrites by Lively. Representatives for Swift said at the time ""she was not involved in any casting or creative decision"" and ""never saw an edit or made any notes on the film"". The subpoena was dropped about two weeks later, after Swift's legal team objected that the legal order amounted to an ""unwarranted fishing expedition"", Variety said. Copyright 2025 BBC.

6/3/2025,Article,Major new Madeleine McCann search under way in Portugal,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy4k1vg34wlo,"Portuguese and German authorities have begun a new search for Madeleine McCann in Portugal, nearly two decades after she disappeared. Madeleine was three when she vanished from an apartment complex in Praia da Luz in the Algarve on 3 May 2007, sparking a Europe-wide police investigation that has become one of the highest-profile missing persons cases. Portuguese police said on Monday they were carrying out warrants from German prosecutors to search 21 plots of land between where Madeleine went missing and where the German investigators' prime suspect had been staying at the time. Tuesday's search appears to have focused on an abandoned building, where officers were seen digging and clearing rocks. The search - which covers the municipality of Lagos, near Praia da Luz - is due to continue until Friday. On Tuesday morning, a Portuguese fire engine and four vehicles carrying German police arrived at the search site - located around 3.5 miles from the Ocean Club resort, where Madeleine and her family had been staying. Roads leading up to the site - which is large and mostly scrubland - have been closed since Monday, where the team has been clearing grass and vegetation. The day's efforts appear to centre on disused buildings near the coast. The team has also examined wells, while firefighters have drained one particular well. Around 30 German officers are expected to take part in the search.  Charlie Hedges, the former missing children chief at the National Crime Agency (NCA), who has worked on some of the UK's highest-profile cases, said it appeared investigators were ""casting the net a bit wider"" with the latest search. ""It seems a bit widespread to be [that] they're looking for something particular,"" he told the BBC. ""If it was a firm lead, you'd have thought it would be defined and towards one place."" However, he said they must have had enough justification to acquire the search warrants. ""They'd need to get approval for funding from Germany, and it should be quite a considerable cost with the number of resources and working abroad and the rest of it."" Madeleine's case was initially handled by the Portuguese authorities with the aid of the Metropolitan Police.  German investigators have taken a lead since 2020, when they identified German national Christian Brückner as their prime suspect. The 48-year-old is currently serving a sentence in Germany for the rape of a 72-year-old American tourist in Portugal in 2005. He was due to be released in September, but that could be pushed back to early 2026 if he does not pay a fine he owes.  German authorities fear that if Brückner is not charged with anything, he will disappear following his release.  German police suspect him of murder. British police continue to treat the case as a missing persons investigation. Brückner has repeatedly denied any involvement and no charges have been brought against him relating to her disappearance.  Portuguese authorities have also named Brückner as a formal suspect, or ""arguido"". They said they will hand over any evidence seized in the latest search to German authorities. The Met Police, which said this week that it was aware of the searches being carried out by German police in Portugal, continues its investigation into Madeleine's disappearance. The case, known as Operation Grange, has been ongoing since 2011 and has cost around £13.3m to date. Officials have not disclosed if they are conducting this latest search in Portugal based on any new information, making it appear as if they are taking one last look in places where evidence or a body could have been hidden. German police have a European warrant, which has been approved by Portuguese prosecutors, to allow them to conduct searches on private land.  The last search took place two years ago and was focused around a reservoir to the north-east of where Madeleine was staying. Brückner, who spent time in the area between 2000 and 2017, was found to have photographs and videos of himself near the reservoir. Mr Hedges said the latest search area could be ""a gap they're trying to plug"". He suggested Brückner's impending release was ""probably driving things"" and police needed to ""nail down"" further evidence. Jim Gamble, founding chief executive of the Child Exploitation and Online Protection unit of the NCA, said a review of the case he led in 2010 had ""identified areas that should have been searched and could have been searched that weren't"". He told the BBC that mistakes in the original investigation had ""created a legacy of chaos that undermined the investigation for many years"", requiring new searches to  cover old ground. Mr Gamble added that, 18 years on, investigators would be using new forensic techniques, including equipment that can scan below the surface of the earth. On the night Madeleine disappeared, her parents had been at dinner with friends at a restaurant a short walk away while their three-year-old daughter and her younger twin siblings were asleep in the ground-floor apartment. Her mother, Kate, discovered she was missing at around 22:00. A German documentary in 2022 found evidence that Brückner occasionally worked at the Ocean Club as a handyman, while German prosecutors have also linked his mobile phone data and a car sale to their case against him. Last month, Madeleine's parents marked the 18th year anniversary of her disappearance, saying their ""determination to leave no stone unturned is unwavering"".

6/3/2025,Article,A timeline of Madeleine McCann's disappearance as new search begins,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2lkwzp0r81o,"Three-year-old Madeleine McCann vanished from a Portuguese holiday apartment 18 years ago. In the intervening years, a huge, costly police operation has taken place across much of Europe and Madeleine has became one of the most high profile missing people.  Madeleine's parents, Kate and Gerry, say all they have ever wanted is to find their daughter. Now German police investigating her disappearance are holding fresh searches in Portugal.  On 3 May Madeleine, from Rothley, Leicestershire, is on holiday with her family at the Ocean Club in Praia da Luz, Portugal. On 12 May, the McCanns say they ""cannot describe the anguish and despair"" they are feeling. Portuguese police say they believe Madeleine was abducted but is still alive and in Portugal. On 26 May, police issue a description of a man seen on the night of Madeleine's disappearance, possibly carrying a child. In June, a Portuguese police chief admits vital forensic clues may have been destroyed as the scene was not protected properly. In July, British police send sniffer dogs to assist the investigation, and inspections of the McCann's apartment and rental car are conducted. By August it is 100 days since Madeleine disappeared. Investigating officers publicly acknowledge she may not be found alive. On 6 September, Portuguese police interview Kate McCann as a witness. On 7 September, detectives make the couple ""arguidos"" and days later, the McCanns return to the UK. Prosecutors later say there is no new evidence to justify re-questioning them. Gerry McCann releases a video in November saying he believes his family was watched by ""a predator"" in the days before his daughter's disappearance. On 20 January the McCanns release sketches of a suspect, based on a description by a British holidaymaker of a ""creepy man"" seen at the resort. In April, Portuguese police fly to the UK to sit in on interviews conducted by Leicestershire Police of the McCanns' friends they had dinner with on the night Madeleine disappeared. On 3 May, one year since the disappearance, Kate McCann urges people to ""pray like mad"" for her little girl. By July Portuguese police say they have submitted their final report on the case. Weeks later, authorities shelve their investigation and lift the ""arguido"" status of the McCanns. On 3 November, new images of how Madeleine might now look are released. In March 2010, the McCanns criticise the release of previously unseen Portuguese police files - detailing possible sightings of Madeleine - to British newspapers. A month later, in April, Gerry McCann says it is ""incredibly frustrating"" that police in Portugal and the UK had not been actively looking for his daughter ""for a very long time"". In November, the couple sign a publishing deal to write a book about Madeleine's disappearance. The McCanns' book, Madeleine, is released in May. Prime Minister David Cameron asks the Metropolitan Police to help investigate. A two-year review follows. Det Ch Insp Andy Redwood, the detective leading the UK review of Madeleine's disappearance, tells an April broadcast of the BBC's Panorama his team is ""seeking to bring closure to the case"". A computer-generated image of what Madeleine might look like aged nine is released, a day before Portuguese authorities say they are not reopening their investigation. In May, UK detectives reviewing the case say they have identified ""a number of persons of interest"". By July, Scotland Yard announces it has ""new evidence and new witnesses"" in the case and opens a formal investigation. By October, Scotland Yard detectives say they have identified 41 potential suspects. A BBC Crimewatch appeal features e-fit images of a man seen carrying a blond-haired child of three or four in Praia da Luz at about the time Madeleine went missing. Portuguese police reopen their investigation - to run alongside Scotland Yard's - citing ""new lines of inquiry"". In January British detectives fly to Portugal amid claims they are planning to make arrests. In June searches in Praia da Luz are carried out, including an area of scrubland situated south-west of the Ocean Club complex. It yields nothing of interest. A month later, in July, four suspects are quizzed by police but no new developments emerge. In September 2015 the British government disclose that the investigation has cost more than £10m. In April 2017 the four official suspects investigated by police are ruled out of the investigation but senior officers say they are pursuing a ""significant line of inquiry"". In June 2019 the UK government says it will fund the Met Police inquiry, which began in 2011, until March 2020. A year later, in June 2020, police reveal that a 43-year-old German prisoner - named by German media as Christian B - has been identified as a suspect. The McCanns thank police, saying: ""All we have ever wanted is to find her, uncover the truth and bring those responsible to justice. ""We will never give up hope of finding Madeleine alive, but whatever the outcome may be, we need to know as we need to find peace."" German investigators have classed it as a murder inquiry and say they are assuming that Madeleine is dead. The UK's Metropolitan Police says it has received more than 270 calls and emails since a new appeal for information was launched on Wednesday. In April 2022, a German man is declared an official suspect by Portuguese prosecutors investigating the case. Christian Brückner, then 45, is made an ""arguido"", although Portuguese authorities do not formally reveal the suspect's name. The McCann family mark the 16th anniversary of Madeleine's disappearance on 3 May 2023, saying she is ""still very much missed"" and they ""await a breakthrough"". Later that month, a Portuguese news website reports that an area near a reservoir, about 30 miles (48km) from Praia da Luz, had been being sealed off. Police say they will begin searching the Arade dam on 23 May, but the search ends after three days.  In October, Portuguese police apologise to the McCanns saying the investigation into Madeleine's disappearance was not handled properly, there was insufficient importance given at the time to missing children and that her parents' position as foreigners in an environment they did not understand was not appreciated. In April, the UK government approved more than £100,000 in additional funding for Scotland Yard detectives investigating Madeleine's disappearance.  A month later in May, the McCann family marked 18 years since her disappearance, saying their ""determination to leave no stone unturned is unwavering"". In the same month, it emerged chief suspect in Madeleine's disappearance Christian Brückner - who is serving a sentence for a sexually assaulting an elderly American woman in Praia da Luz in 2005 - is set to be released from prison in Germany later than originally scheduled according to his lawyer. He is due to be released in September or, if he does not pay a fine, early 2026.  On 3 June, fresh searches led by German police start in Portugal, between Praia da Luz and Lagos. The areas being searched are close to a ramshackle dwelling where Brückner lived at the time of Madeleine's disappearance. Copyright 2025 BBC.

6/3/2025,Article,Why monsoon rains wreak havoc annually in India's cities,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr7zlm3mpejo,"""Who is responsible for this mess?"" The question recently echoed across India's financial capital Mumbai as thousands of residents once again found themselves stranded, soaked and frustrated. Heavy rains brought the city to a standstill, and this was before the monsoon had even begun in full swing. Roads turned into rivers, vehicles broke down mid-commute and low-lying neighbourhoods were waterlogged within hours.  Even a newly-built underground metro station could not withstand the heavy downpour as photos and videos of the station flooded with muddy water went viral.  The pre-monsoon deluge once again exposed the city's fragile infrastructure and sparked widespread outrage on social media. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), one of India's richest civic organisations responsible for maintaining Mumbai's infrastructure, initially blamed the problem on rubbish clogging the drains and debris from metro construction, The Hindustan Times newspaper reported. Following criticism, the BMC installed de-watering pumps in flood-prone areas and began manually clearing waste from drains to prevent further waterlogging. But for many residents, the action came too late. The crisis is neither new - nor is it unique to Mumbai. From Delhi in the north to Bengaluru in the south, India's biggest cities flood every monsoon season. Roads collapse, drains overflow, infrastructure is overwhelmed and traffic grinds to a halt. Experts blame rapid unplanned urbanisation, poor infrastructure and years of environmental neglect as the root causes of this problem.  ""The pace of urban expansion has far exceeded the evolution of supporting infrastructure, particularly in water and drainage systems,"" says Dikshu Kukreja, an architect and urban planner based in Delhi. ""Many cities rely on outdated systems designed decades ago. And in the process of unchecked expansion, natural drainage channels, wetlands and water bodies that once absorbed excess rainwater have been built over or neglected,"" he adds. Experts say there's no one-size-fits-all solution as each city faces unique challenges and factors such as geography, population and climate must be considered when designing effective responses. India receives 80% of its annual rainfall during the monsoon season, which usually starts from June and continues until September. The monsoon is crucial for agriculture and the livelihoods of millions of Indian farmers. They rely on seasonal showers in parts of the country where proper irrigation channels are absent. But experts say climate change has made erratic weather - such as unseasonal rains, flash floods and droughts linked to extreme heat - a more regular phenomenon, directly affecting millions of people. This year the monsoon arrived a week early in parts of southern India, catching authorities unprepared.  ""A depression developed over the eastern central Arabian Sea which was instrumental in pulling up the monsoon current,"" says Mahesh Palawat, vice-president of meteorology and climate change at weather forecasting company Skymet.  In Delhi, the Minto bridge has become a symbol of the city's annual monsoon chaos. Almost every year, after heavy rain, a bus or lorry gets stuck under the bridge - an image that highlights the city's struggle with urban flooding. This year, Delhi recorded its wettest May since 1901, with more than 185mm of rainfall, according to the Indian weather department.  Many residents reported damage to their property.  At least four people were killed and dozens more were injured in one of the two heavy storms that hit the city in May, according to media reports. Meanwhile, in Bengaluru, more than 2,000kms (1,240 miles) from the capital, the problem looks different but its root cause is the same.  Once known for its network of lakes that helped manage excess rainwater, Bengaluru has seen many of these water bodies encroached upon. In their place now stand apartment complexes, business hubs and roads - leaving the city vulnerable to flooding. ""Bengaluru is made up of three major valleys through which water naturally flows. Most of the city's lakes are located in these valleys,"" explains Ram Prasad, a lake conservation activist. These valleys were originally designated as no-construction zones but over the years, encroachment has taken place and later changes in the law permitted infrastructure projects to be built in the area, he says.  ""When you convert lakes - which traditionally act as flood buffers - into built-up areas, the water has nowhere to go. So, what we're seeing in Bengaluru today is the result of poor urban planning.""  Mr Prasad points out that Bengaluru, which sits atop a hill, was never meant to flood and the current situation is entirely man-made. Violations of building norms, especially construction that narrows stormwater drains or builds directly over them, have only made things worse, he says. Meanwhile, Mumbai faces natural challenges due to its geography. For example, many parts of Mumbai are low-lying and close to the sea, which makes them more vulnerable to flooding during heavy rains and high tides. But experts say it's human actions that have made things much worse: cutting down mangroves, which normally act like natural barriers against floods, and building on floodplains where water is supposed to drain. ""The breakdown is systemic - it begins with planning that often doesn't account for future climate variabilities, gets exacerbated by poor execution and is compounded by weak enforcement of regulations,"" Mr Kukerja says. ""Political will is often reactive - responding to disasters rather than investing in long-term resilience."" This isn't just a big city problem. Smaller towns often suffer equally, if not more.  Over the weekend, at least 30 people died in India's northeastern states after heavy rains triggered flooding and landslides. Tens of thousands have been affected, with rescue efforts under way.  So, can anything be done to prevent this? ""Yes,"" says Mr Kukreja, but only if it is part of a long-term, co-ordinated strategy. He suggests using mapping and real-time sensors to identify high-risk zones and alert communities. Predictive models can also help authorities plan better responses. ""But technology alone is not a fix, it needs to be paired with responsive governance and community involvement,"" he said. For India's cities to withstand the rains, they need more than just de-watering pumps and quick fixes. They need forward-thinking planning, before the damage is done.

6/3/2025,Article,The British jet engine that failed in the 'Valley of Death',https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y5zg85wnlo,"""It was going great until it fell apart."" Richard Varvill recalls the emotional shock that hits home when a high-tech venture goes off the rails. The former chief technology officer speaks ruefully about his long career trying to bring a revolutionary aerospace engine to fruition at UK firm Reaction Engines. The origins of Reaction Engines go back to the Hotol project in the 1980s. This was a futuristic space plane that caught the public imagination with the prospect of a British aircraft flying beyond the atmosphere. The secret sauce of Hotol was heat exchanger technology, an attempt to cool the super-heated 1,000C air that enters an engine at hypersonic speeds. Without cooling this will melt aluminium, and is, Mr Varvill says, ""literally too hot to handle"". Fast forward three decades to October 2024 and Reaction Engines was bringing the heat exchanger to life at sites in the UK and US. UK Ministry of Defence funding took the company into hypersonic research with Rolls-Royce for an unmanned aircraft. But that was not enough to keep the business afloat. Rolls-Royce declines to go into details about Reaction's collapse, but Mr Varvill is more specific. ""Rolls-Royce said it had other priorities and the UK military has very little money."" Aviation is a business with a very long gestation time for a product. It can take 20 years to develop an aircraft. This unforgiving journey is known as crossing the Valley of Death. Mr Varvill knew the business had to raise more funds towards the end of 2024 but big investors  were reluctant to jump on board. ""The game was being played right to the very end, but to cross the Valley of Death in aerospace is very hard."" What was the atmosphere like in those last days as the administrators moved in? ""It was pretty grim, we were all called into the lecture theatre and the managing director gave a speech about how the board 'had tried everything'. Then came the unpleasant experience of handing over passes and getting personal items. It was definitely a bad day at the office."" This bad day was too much for some. ""A few people were in tears. A lot of them were shocked and upset because they'd hoped we could pull it off right up to the end."" It was galling for Mr Varvill ""because we were turning it around with an improved engine. Just as we were getting close to succeeding we failed. That's a uniquely British characteristic."" Did they follow the traditional path after a mass lay-off and head to the nearest pub? ""We had a very large party at my house. Otherwise it would have been pretty awful to have put all that effort into the company and not mark it in some way."" His former colleague Kathryn Evans headed up the space effort, the work around hypersonic flight for the Ministry of Defence and opportunities to apply the technology in any other commercial areas. When did she know the game was up? ""It's tricky to say when I knew it was going wrong, I was very hopeful to the end. While there was a lot of uncertainty there was a strong pipeline of opportunities."" She remembers the moment the axe fell and she joined 200 colleagues in the HQ's auditorium. ""It was the 31st of October, a Thursday, I knew it was bad news but when you're made redundant with immediate effect there's no time to think about it. We'd all been fighting right to the end so then my adrenalin crashed."" And those final hours were recorded. One of her colleagues brought in a Polaroid camera. Portrait photos were taken and stuck on a board with message expressing what Reaction Engines meant to individuals. What did Ms Evans write? ""I will very much miss working with brilliant minds in a kind, supportive culture."" Since then she's been reflecting ""on an unfinished mission and the technology's potential"". But her personal pride remains strong. ""It was British engineering at its best and it's important for people to hold their heads up high."" Her boss Adam Dissel, president of Reaction Engines, ran the US arm of the business. He laments the unsuccessful struggle to wrest more funds from big names in aerospace. ""The technology consistently worked and was fairly mature. But some of our strategic investors weren't excited enough to put more money in and that put others off."" The main investors were Boeing, BAE Systems and Roll-Royce. He feels they could have done more to give the wider investment community confidence in Reaction Engines. It would have avoided a lot of pain.  ""My team had put heart and soul into the company and we had a good cry. "" Did they really shed tears? ""Absolutely, I had my tears at our final meeting where we joined hands and stood up. I said 'We still did great, take a bow."" What lessons can we draw for other high-tech ventures? ""You definitely have no choice but to be optimistic,"" says Mr Dissel. The grim procedure of winding down the business took over as passwords and laptops were collected while servers were backed up in case ""some future incarnation of the business can be preserved"". The company had been going in various guises for 35 years. ""We didn't want it to go to rust. I expect the administrator will look for a buyer for the intellectual property assets,"" Mr Dissel adds. Other former employees also hold out for a phoenix rising from the ashes. But the Valley of Death looms large. ""Reaction Engines was playing at the very edge of what was possible. We were working for the fastest engines and highest temperatures. We bit off the hard job,"" says Mr Dissel. Despite all this Mr Varvill's own epitaph for the business overshadows technological milestones. ""We failed because we ran out of money."" Copyright 2025 BBC.

6/3/2025,Article,How Ukraine carried out daring 'Spider Web' attack on Russian bombers,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq69qnvj6nlo,"It was an attack of astonishing ingenuity – unprecedented, broad, and 18 months in the making. On 1 June more than 100 Ukrainian drones struck air bases deep inside Russia, targeting nuclear-capable long-range bombers. The scale of the operation dubbed ""Spider Web"" became clear almost as soon as it began, with explosions reported across several time zones all over Russia - as far north as Murmansk above the Arctic Circle, and as far east as Irkutsk, over 4,000km from Ukraine. The Russian Defence Ministry confirmed the attacks had occurred in five regions of Russia - Murmansk, Irkutsk, Ivanovo, Ryazan and Amur -  but stated planes had been damaged only in Murmansk and Irkutsk, while in other locations the attacks had been repelled. In photos released shortly after the attack, Vasyl Maliuk, the head of the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), can be seen looking at a satellite map of airfields in which the bases in the locations listed by Russia are clearly identifiable. Maliuk said the drones were first smuggled into Russia, then placed inside wooden cabins mounted on the back of lorries and concealed below remotely operated detachable roofs. The lorries were then apparently driven to locations near airbases by drivers who were seemingly unaware of their cargo; then, the drones were launched and set upon their targets. Videos circulating online show drones emerging from the roof of one of the vehicles involved. One lorry driver interviewed by Russian state outlet Ria Novosti said he and other drivers tried to knock down drones flying out of a lorry with rocks. ""They were in the back of the truck and we threw stones to keep them from flying up, to keep them pinned down,"" he said. According to unverified reports by Russian Telegram channel Baza – which is known for its links to the security services – the drivers of the lorries from which the drones took off all told similar stories of being booked by businessmen to deliver wooden cabins in various locations around Russia. Some of them said they then received further instructions over the phone on where to park the lorries; when they did so, they were stunned to see drones fly out of them.  In a triumphant post shared on social media on Sunday night, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky – who directly supervised the operation - said 117 drones had been used in the daring attack that took ""one year, six months and nine days"" to prepare.  He also said one of the targeted locations was right next to one of the offices of the FSB Russian security services.  Russia has said it has detained people in connection with the attack, although Zelensky stated the people who had helped facilitate the operation ""were withdrawn from Russian territory... they are now safe"". In a now-deleted Telegram post, local authorities from the city of Ust-Kut in the Irkutsk region said they were looking for a Ukrainian-born 37-year-old in connection with the drone attack on the Belaya military airfield. Images shared by the SBU show dozens of small black drones neatly stashed in wooden cabins inside a warehouse, which Russian military bloggers pinpointed to a location in Chelyabinsk. Dr Steve Wright, a UK-based drone expert, told the BBC the drones used to hit Russian aircraft were simple quadcopters carrying relatively heavy payloads. He added that what made this attack ""quite extraordinary"" was the ability to smuggle them into Russia and then launch and command them remotely – which he concluded had been achieved through a link relayed through a satellite or the internet. Zelensky said each of the 117 drones launched had its own pilot.  Dr Wright also suggested it was likely the drones were able to fly in using GPS but may have also overcome localised Russian jamming measures by manually piloting drones remotely. Kyiv has not shared details on the origin of the drones, but since the start of the war Ukraine has become extremely efficient at manufacturing them – and it is possible the ones used in this operation were produced at home.  ""Russia has had very tangible losses, and justifiably so,"" said Zelensky in his nightly video address. According to Ukraine, 41 strategic bombers were hit and ""at least"" 13 destroyed. Moscow has not confirmed any losses of aircraft beyond saying some planes had been damaged. Videos verified by the BBC show damaged aircraft at the Olenegorsk air base in Murmansk and the Belaya air base in Irkutsk.  The strategic missile-carrying bombers targeted in the attack are thought to be – among others - the Tu-95, Tu-22 and Tu-160. Repairing them will be difficult and, because none are still in production, replacing them is impossible. Radar satellite imagery shared by Capella Space reveals at least four badly damaged or destroyed Russian long-range bombers at Belaya airbase. This matches Ukrainian drone footage also showing an attack on a Tu-95 bomber. ""According to the laws and customs of war, we have worked out absolutely legitimate targets – military airfields and aircraft that bomb our peaceful cities,"" said SBU head Vasyl Malyuk.  Tu-95 bombers are said to have launched a large-scale Kh-101 missile attack on Ukraine as recently as last week. Each bomber can carry eight guided cruise missiles and each missile itself carries a 400kg (882lb) warhead. A-50 military spy planes were also reportedly targeted. They are valuable aircraft that boost Russia's ability to both intercept Ukrainian missiles and to launch its own strikes.  It is not known how many A-50s Russia has - but in February 2024 military intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov put that number at eight, so any loss or damage could be a serious blow to Moscow. In a post on social media, the SBU said operation Spider Web cost Russia $7bn (£5.2bn). Russian state media stayed studiously quiet on the attacks, with primetime Sunday TV shows merely quoting statements by regional authorities. By Monday morning, the story had disappeared from the bulletins. On the internet and beyond Ukrainians celebrated, with one lauding the operation as ""titanic"". ""Of course, not everything can be revealed at this moment,"" Zelensky wrote on Telegram, ""but these are Ukrainian actions that will undoubtedly be in history books.""

6/3/2025,Article,Toxic mushroom cook tells murder trial wild fungi have 'more flavour',https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce82lj7g1g7o,"An Australian woman who cooked a toxic mushroom meal has told her murder trial she has long been a mushroom lover, but more recently developed a taste for wild fungi varieties that have ""more flavour"". Erin Patterson has pleaded not guilty to the murder of three relatives, and the attempted murder of another, after serving them death cap mushrooms at her home in Victoria in July 2023.  Prosecutors say she deliberately put the poisonous mushrooms in the meal but her defence team says it was a ""terrible accident"". Ms Patterson - during her second day on the witness stand - told the jury she began foraging for wild mushrooms during the Covid pandemic, years before the fatal meal. Ms Patterson's in-laws, Don and Gail Patterson, both 70, and Gail's sister Heather Wilkinson, 66, were all hospitalised after eating beef wellington at the lunch and died several days later. Ian Wilkinson, the uncle of Ms Patterson's estranged husband, also fell seriously ill but survived after weeks of treatment. After telling the court she accepted that death cap mushrooms were in the food she had served, Ms Patterson described foraging for mushrooms at various locations - botanic gardens, a rail trail near her house, and on her own property.  ""I mainly picked field mushrooms,"" she told the court, explaining she sometimes foraged with her two children.  She recounted the first time she tried wild mushrooms, cutting off a small part before cooking it in butter.  ""[It] tasted good and I didn't get sick,"" she told the jury. The court also heard she had bought a food dehydrator in April 2023, in part because wild mushrooms had such a ""small season"" and she wanted to preserve them for later use. Asked where the mushrooms for the lunch at the centre of the case came from, Ms Patterson said ""the vast majority"" were purchased from a supermarket in Leongatha while some had been bought a few months earlier from an Asian grocery store in Melbourne.  She couldn't remember ""the specific purchase"", but had previously bought a variety of mushrooms - shitake, porcini, enoki - from similar stores, she said. Other times, she'd purchased ""wild mushroom mix"" or ""forest mushrooms"" which didn't specify exact contents. These store-bought mushrooms were often put in the same container as ones she had foraged and dehydrated herself - including in the months before the lunch - she said. Earlier Ms Patterson had stepped through changes in her dynamic with Simon Patterson and her in-laws following the couple's separation in 2015. ""In the immediate aftermath it was difficult... but that only lasted a couple of weeks... we went back to being really good friends."" Her relationship with her in-laws Don and Gail ""never changed"", she said. ""I was just their daughter-in-law - they just continued to love me."" However, she told the court her relationship with Simon turned tense amid conflict over finances from October 2022 onwards, and she had tried to get her in-laws to mediate. The court was shown expletive-laden Facebook messages that Ms Patterson sent to a private group chat, which were critical of the Simon, Don and Gail.  ""I needed to vent... to get my frustration off my chest,"" she said, and her choice was either to tell the sheep in her paddock, or speak to what she called her ""cheer squad"". Becoming emotional, she repeatedly told the court how much she cared for Don and Gail and how she wished she ""had never said that"". She also testified about a deep mistrust of the health system, developed after medical concerns she raised about her two children were initially dismissed by clinicians. These experiences led to her decision to discharge herself early from the hospital after the toxic lunch in 2023, despite doctor's advice, she said.  She also experienced health anxiety and did a lot of Dr Googling - searching the web about symptoms - which at different points in time lead her to falsely suspect she had a brain tumour, MS (multiple sclerosis) and ovarian cancer. Ms Patterson admitted that she had never been diagnosed with ovarian cancer, despite allegedly asking the lunch guests to her house to discuss the diagnosis, but said her family had a history of it. Ms Patterson is expected to continue giving evidence on Wednesday morning, local time, when the court reopens.  Copyright 2025 BBC.

6/3/2025,Article,Disney makes hundreds more layoffs as it cuts costs,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce80j93wrd2o,"Disney says it is laying off several hundred more people around the world, with workers in its film, television and finance departments impacted. The entertainment giant has been under pressure as viewers move away from cable TV subscriptions in favour of streaming platforms. ""As our industry transforms at a rapid pace, we continue to evaluate ways to efficiently manage our businesses while fuelling the state-of-the-art creativity and innovation that consumers value and expect from Disney,"" a spokesperson told the BBC. The latest job cuts follow major layoffs announced in 2023, when around 7,000 workers were let go as part of a drive by chief executive Bob Iger to save $5.5bn (£4.1bn). The cuts will impact multiple teams including marketing departments for its film and television units. Workers in Disney's casting and development and corporate finance departments will also be affected. ""We have been surgical in our approach to minimise the number of impacted employees,"" said a spokesperson. The company also said that no teams will be closed down entirely. The California-based firm employs 233,000 workers, with just over 60,000 of those based outside the US. Disney owns a host of companies across the entertainment industry including Marvel, Hulu and ESPN. The firm reported stronger than expected earnings in May, with overall revenue of $23.6bn for the first three months of the year. That was a 7% increase from the same period in 2024. It said the growth was fuelled by new subscribers to its Disney+ streaming service. The company has released a number of new films this year including Captain America: Brave New World and Snow White. The live action remake of the iconic Snow White animated film did not perform as well as expected at cinemas, after facing a number of negative reviews.  But Disney's latest release, Lilo & Stitch, broke box office records in the US for the Memorial Day holiday weekend. The animated film has seen global ticket sales of more than $610m since its release in May, according to industry data firm Box Office Mojo. Copyright 2025 BBC.

6/3/2025,Article,Trump tariffs forecast to hurt global growth,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq69j753egeo,"UK economic growth will suffer because of US tariff barriers and high interest payments on government debt, an influential global policy group has said. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) cut its expectations for UK growth this year to 1.3% from the 1.4% it had predicted in March. The think tank has cut forecasts globally due to trade tensions, but said the UK faced particular issues due to its ""very thin"" buffer in public finances, calling on Chancellor Rachel Reeves to boost tax take and cut spending. In response to the OECD's comments, Reeves said she was ""determined to go further and faster to put more money in people's pockets through our plan for change"". Next week, Reeves will set out her Spending Review where she faces tough choices on allocating departmental budgets. The government has already committed billions of pounds to defence, while the NHS is also expected to be a focus amid Labour's pledge to reduce waiting lists. In March, Reeves was forced to announce £14bn in measures, including £4.8bn in welfare cuts, to restore headroom against her self-imposed fiscal rules. While the OECD highlighted better-than-expected UK economic growth, which strengthened to 0.7% between January and March, it cautioned that ""momentum is weakening"" due to ""deteriorating"" business sentiment. It forecast the UK economy would expand by 1% in 2026, compared to the 1.2% it pencilled in a few months ago. ""The state of the public finances is a significant downside risk to the outlook if the fiscal rules are to be met,"" the OECD said. It suggested that Reeves should adopt a ""balanced approach"" of ""targeted spending cuts"" and tax increases to improve the UK's public finances. ""Strengthening the public finances remains a priority... including through the upcoming Spending Review,"" the OECD said. It suggested closing tax loopholes and re-evaluating council tax bands based on updated property values.  Under the current system, council tax in England is calculated based on the price the property would have sold for in April 1991. For Wales, it is evaluated on property prices in April 2003. Meanwhile, worldwide growth is now expected to slow to a ""modest"" 2.9%, down from a previous forecast of 3.1%, the OECD said. It blamed a ""significant"" rise in trade barriers and warned that ""weakened economic prospects will be felt around the world, with almost no exception"". The OECD's comments come as Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey told a Treasury Select Committee on Wednesday that the global system of trade agreements had been ""blown up to a considerable degree"" by global trade tensions.  Since US President Donald Trump returned to the White House, a long list of countries have been targeted by tariffs, but Trump's unpredictable approach to implementing the measures has created widespread uncertainty.  ""We are forecasting basically a downgrade for almost everybody,"" Alvaro Pereira, the OECD's chief economist told the BBC.  ""We'll have a lot less growth and job creation than we had forecasted in the past."" The group also slashed the outlook for the US economy this year from 2.2% to 1.6% and predicted growth would slow again in 2026. It warned that the US was at risk from rising inflation, something that Trump repeatedly promised would fall during his presidential campaign. Prior to the release of the OECD report on Tuesday, Trump wrote on social media: ""Because of Tariffs, our Economy is BOOMING!"" However, the most recent official data showed the US economy shrank at an annual rate of 0.2% in the first three months of this year, the first contraction since 2022.  Copyright 2025 BBC.

Matt Jones walked the Llangollen Round twice in 34 hours, raising money for children's hospice Hope House Ty Gobaith, in honour of his wife Vicky, who died just before Christmas. He made a bet with his wife in September after having a hip replacement, which he needed after getting injured while completing the walk in his hometown in 2018.

6/4/2025,Article,Meghan shares new photos of Lilibet to mark fourth birthday,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cewd79ey270o,"The Duchess of Sussex has posted a video of her dancing while pregnant with Princess Lilibet four years ago to mark her daughter's birthday.  The video features Meghan and the Duke of Sussex dance and gyrate in a hospital room.  The couple were recreating a TikTok challenge which sees pregnant women and their partners dance to a song called Baby Mama Dance.  She wrote on Instagram: ""Four years ago today, this also happened. Both of our children were a week past their due dates... so when spicy food, all that walking, and acupuncture didn't work - there was only one thing left to do!"" It is not known if the dance challenge, created by comic Cameron Henderson in 2013 and includes the lyrics ""been pregnant for way too long"", did indeed induce Meghan's labour.  The post came after a series of posts by the duchess sharing intimate family photos of four-year-old Princess Lilibet.  Meghan shared a black-and-white snap of her cuddling her daughter, who is sitting on her lap, with the pair both sporting windswept hair, appearing to be on a boat.  The second image shows Meghan tenderly cradling the princess as a newborn following her birth in 2021.  Meghan wrote: ""Happy birthday to our beautiful girl! Four years ago today she came into our lives – and each day is brighter and better because of it. ""Thanks to all of those sending love and celebrating her special day!"" The duchess also released an image of a newborn Princess Lillibet looking up at her father.  Another image shows the duke and his daughter in a dress walking bare feet in the sand, with their backs turned to the camera, surrounded by palm trees.  ""The sweetest bond to watch unfold,"" she said of the pictures. ""Daddy's little girl and favourite adventurer. Happy birthday Lili!"" Meghan usually only shares photos of the princess pictured from behind to protect her privacy, but in one of the newly released photos you can see Lilibet's eyes and top half of her face, with the bottom half covered by Meghan's arms as she hugs her daughter.  The princess - the youngest child of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex - was born on 4 June 2021, a year after her parents stepped back from being senior royals and moved to the US. She became a princess when her grandfather the King became monarch.  The couple also share Prince Archie, aged six.   On Tuesday, Meghan said she wondered about launching a future business with her daughter as she chatted to Beyonce's mother Tina Knowles on her podcast Confessions Of A Female Founder.  ""I wonder if one day I'll be in business with Lili and we'll be building something,"" the duchess said, with Knowles adding: ""That's the best."" Last week, the duchess shared a clip of her and the princess beekeeping in protective suits, writing: ""Like mother, like daughter; she's even wearing my gloves.""  Lilibet is named after her great-grandmother Queen Elizabeth II.  The nickname was coined when then-Princess Elizabeth was a toddler and could not pronounce her own name properly.  Her grandfather King George V would affectionately call her Lilibet, imitating her attempts to say her name. It stuck and came to be used by close relatives.

6/4/2025,Article,South Korea's new president has a Trump-shaped crisis to avert,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpvkxxerln1o,"South Korea's new president, Lee Jae-myung, has secured a storming victory, but his honeymoon will barely last the day. The former opposition leader is not getting to enjoy the two-month transition period usually afforded to new leaders, so they can build their team and nail down their vision for the country.  Instead he is entering office immediately, to fill the hole left by the impeachment of the former president, Yoon Suk Yeol, who last December tried and failed to bring the country under martial law. In electing Lee, with almost 50% of the vote , South Koreans have vehemently rejected the military dictatorship that was almost forced upon them. Lee campaigned on the promise that he would strengthen South Korea's democracy and unite the country, after a divisive and tumultuous six months. But that will have to wait. First, he has a Donald Trump shaped crisis to avert. In the coming months, Trump has the power to destabilise South Korea's economy, its security, and its volatile relationship with North Korea. South Koreans were dismayed when Trump slapped 25% tariffs on all Korean imports in April, after already hitting the country with aggressive tariffs on its core industries – steel and cars. They had assumed that being longstanding military allies from the days of the Korean War, and having a free-trade agreement with the US, would spare them. If these tariffs take effect ""they could trigger an economic crisis"", a seasoned advisor to Lee's Democratic Party, Moon Chung-in, said.  Before Trump's announcements, South Korea's economy was already slowing down. The martial law chaos constricted it further. Then, in the first quarter of this year, it contracted. Fixing this has been voters' number one demand, even above fixing their beleaguered democracy. But without a president, talks with Trump have been on hold. They cannot be put off any longer. And there is much more than South Korea's economy at stake in these negotiations. The US currently guarantees South Korea's security by promising to come to its defence with both conventional and nuclear weapons were it to be attacked by its nuclear-armed neighbour, North Korea. As part of this deal there are 28,500 US troops stationed in the South. Yet Trump has made clear he does not plan to differentiate between trade and security when negotiating with the country, signalling that Seoul is not pulling its weight in either area. In a post on his Truth Social platform in April, Trump said that during initial tariff talks with South Korea he had ""discussed payment for the big time military protection we provide"", calling it ""beautiful and efficient one-stop shopping"". This approach makes Seoul uniquely vulnerable.  Evans Revere, a former senior US diplomat based in Seoul, fears a crisis is coming. ""For the first time in our lifetime we have a US president who does not feel a moral and strategic obligation towards Korea"". In his first term as president, Trump questioned the value of having US forces stationed in Korea and threatened to withdraw them unless Seoul paid more to have them. It seems likely he will demand more money this time around. Seoul may not want to pay more, but it can afford to. A bigger problem is that Trump's calculations, and that of his defence department, seem to have changed. This is no longer just about the money. Washington's top priority now in Asia is not just stopping North Korea attacking the South, it is also to contain China's military ambitions in the region and against Taiwan. Last year, a now-senior US defence official, Elbridge Colby, said that South Korea was going to have to take ""overwhelming responsibility for its own self-defence against North Korea"", so the US could be ready to fight China. One option is that the troops stationed here would switch their focus to constraining China. Another, touted by a couple of US defence officials last month, is that thousands of soldiers would be removed from the peninsula altogether and redeployed, and that Seoul's military would also have to play a role in deterring Beijing. Not only could this put South Korea in a dangerous military predicament, but it would also create a diplomatically difficult one. President Lee, who historically has been sceptical of Korea's alliance with the US, wants to use his presidency to improve relations with China, South Korea's powerful neighbour and trading partner. He has stated several times that South Korea should stay out of a conflict between China and Taiwan. ""We must keep our distance from a China-Taiwan contingency. We can get along with both"", he said during a televised debate last month. The political advisor Mr Moon, who once served as national security advisor, reiterated Lee's concerns. ""We are worried about America abandoning us, but at the same time we are worried about being entrapped in American strategy to contain and encircle China"", he said. ""If the US threatens us, we can let [the forces] go"", he said. For Mr Revere, the former US diplomat, this combination of Lee, Trump and China threatens to create ""the perfect storm"". ""The two leaders may find themselves on very different pages and that could be a recipe for a problematic relationship. If this plays out, it would undermine peace and stability in North East Asia"". In Pyongyang, Kim Jong Un will no doubt be watching closely, keen to exploit the shifting ground. His nuclear weapons programme is more dangerous than ever, and nothing or no-one has been able to convince him to wind it down - including Donald Trump who, during his first term, was the first US president to ever meet a North Korean leader. Since returning to office Trump has indicated he would like to resume talks with Kim, which ended without agreement in 2019. In Seoul, there is real concern that this time the pair could strike a deal that is very bad for South Korea. The fear is that Trump would take an ""America first"" approach, and ask Kim to stop producing his intercontinental ballistic missiles that threaten the US mainland, without addressing the multiple short-range nuclear weapons pointed at Seoul. And in return, Kim could demand a high price. Kim has far more leverage than he did in 2019. He has more nuclear warheads, his weapons are more advanced, and the sanctions that were supposed to put pressure on his regime have all but collapsed, thanks largely to Vladimir Putin. The Russian leader is providing Kim with economic and military support in return for North Korea's help fighting the war in Ukraine. This therefore gives Kim the cover to make more audacious requests of the US. He could ask Trump to accept North Korea as a nuclear weapons state, and agree to a deal that would reduce Pyongyang's weapons count rather than get rid of them altogether. Another of his requests could likely be for the US to remove some of the security it provides South Korea, including the troops. ""North Korea is in the driver's seat now. The only curveball is how much risk President Trump will take"", said Sydney Seiler, who was involved in the 2019 negotiations on the US side. ""The idea there might be some sort of troop withdrawal [included in a deal] is really not that far-fetched"". Mr Seiler stressed that the US would ""not leave South Korea in the dust,"" but advised South Korea's new president to ""establish a relationship with Trump early on"", and be clear they expect to be part of any process, if talks materialise. The new president must move quickly on all fronts, added Mr Revere, arguing that Lee's first homework assignment should be to come up with a list of 10 reasons why South Korea is an indispensable partner and why American dollars are being well spent; reasons that can convince a sceptical and transactional Trump. One Ace card South Korea is hoping to play is its shipbuilding prowess. It builds more vessels than any other country bar China, which is now the world's dominant ship builder and home to the largest naval fleet. This is a frightening prospect for the US whose own industry and navy are in decline. Last month I visited South Korea's flagship shipyard in Ulsan on the south coast - the largest in the world – where Hyundai Heavy Industries builds 40-50 new ships a year, including naval destroyers. Sturdy cranes slotted together sheets of metal, creating vessels the size of small villages. Seoul is hoping it can use this expertise to build, repair and maintain warships for the US, and in the process convince Washington it is a valuable partner. ""US shipbuilding difficulties are affecting their national security"", said Jeong Woo Maan, head of strategy for Hyundai's naval and ship unit. ""This is one of the strongest cards we have to negotiate with"". In his campaign for president, Lee Jae-myung declared he did not want to rush into any agreements with Trump. Now in office, he could quickly find himself without this luxury.  Copyright 2025 BBC.

6/4/2025,Article,"Cologne evacuates 20,000 so WW2 bombs can be defused",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj6r04e870do,"Authorities in the German city of Cologne have defused three unexploded World War Two bombs after the evacuation of more than 20,000 people. Bomb squad technicians deactivated the American bombs on Wednesday after evacuating an area of around 10,000 sq m (107,639 sq ft) following their discovery in a shipyard in Deutz on Monday. Homes, shops, hotels and schools were told to evacuate, as well as a large hospital and a major train station in what the city called ""the largest operation since WW2"". Cologne was subjected to particularly heavy bombing during WW2 and unexploded ordnance can still pose a danger. Germany's bomb disposal service was only able to begin the operation after all residents in the densely populated area were evacuated. ""If you refuse, we will escort you from your home - if necessary by force - along with the police,"" the authorities said.  Residents were told if they refused to leave their homes after the evacuation began they could face expensive fines.  Some intensive care patients were helped out in ambulances from the Eduardus Hospital.  Finding bombs from WW2 is not unusual in German cities such as Cologne and Berlin, but these bombs were particularly large. The evacuation in the Old Town and Deutz neighbourhoods began with officials going door to door to tell people they must leave their homes.  Many of the city's usually bustling streets were eerily deserted as shops, restaurants and businesses were told to stop operating during the day.  Cultural institutions including the Philharmonic Hall and many museums were also affected, as well as government buildings, 58 hotels, and nine schools.  Transport was severely disrupted, with all roads closed in the area, many trains cancelled and the Messe/Deutz train station was closed from 08:00 local time (07:00BST).  The authorities had set up two drop-in centres for people who did not have anywhere to go during the evacuation period.  Residents were told to ""stay calm"", bring their ID and any essential medications, and to take care of their pets.  For some people, the evacuation was more than a little inconvenient.  Fifteen couples were scheduled to get married at Cologne's historic town hall but the ceremonies were relocated to a location in another part of the city, local media reported.

6/4/2025,Article,"On the hunt for Tiger, the fugitive linked to illegal South African gold mine where 78 died",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg5k518gq2o,"Nobody in South Africa seems to know where Tiger is. The 42-year-old from neighbouring Lesotho, whose real name is James Neo Tshoaeli, has evaded a police manhunt for the past four months. Detained after being accused of controlling the illegal operations at an abandoned gold mine near Stilfontein in South Africa, where 78 corpses were discovered underground in January, Tiger escaped custody, police allege. Four policemen, alleged to have aided his breakout, are out on bail and awaiting trial, but the authorities appear no closer to learning the fugitive's whereabouts. We went to Lesotho to find out more about this elusive man and to hear from those affected by the subterranean deaths. Tiger's home is near the city of Mokhotlong, a five-hour drive from the capital, Maseru, on the road that skirts the nation's mountains. We visit his elderly mother, Mampho Tshoaeli, and his younger brother, Thabiso. Unlike Tiger, Thabiso decided to stay at home and rear sheep for a living, rather than join the illegal miners, known as zama zamas, in South Africa. Neither of them has seen Tiger in eight years. ""He was a friendly child to everyone,"" Ms Tshoaeli recalls.  ""He was peaceful even at school, his teachers never complained about him. So generally, he was a good person,"" she says. Thabiso, five years younger than Tiger, says they both used to look after the family sheep when they were children. ""When we were growing up he wanted to be a policeman. That was his dream. But that never happened because, when our father passed away, he had to become the head of the family."" Tiger, who was 21 at the time, decided to follow in his father's footsteps and headed to South Africa to work in a mine - but not in the formal sector. ""It was really hard for me,"" says his mother. ""I really felt worried for him because he was still fragile and young at that time. Also because I was told that to go down into the mine, they used a makeshift lift."" He would come back when he got time off or for Christmas. And during that first stint as a zama zama his mother said he was the family's main provider. ""He really supported us a lot. He was supporting me, giving me everything, even his siblings. He made sure that they had clothes and food."" The last time his family saw or heard from him was in 2017 when he left Lesotho with his then wife. Shortly after, the couple separated. ""I thought maybe he'd remarried, and his second wife wasn't allowing him to come back home,"" she says sadly. ""I've been asking: 'Where is my son?' ""The first time I heard he was a zama zama at Stilfontein, I was told by my son. He came to my house holding his phone and he showed me the news on social media and explained that they were saying he escaped from the police."" The police say several illegal miners described him as one of the Stilfontein ring leaders. His mother does not believe he could have been in this position and says seeing the coverage of him has been upsetting. ""It really hurts me a lot because I think maybe he will die there, or maybe he has died already, or if he's lucky to come back home, maybe I won't be here. I'll be among the dead."" A friend of Tiger's from Stilfontein, who only wants to be identified as Ayanda, tells me they used to share food and cigarettes before supplies dwindled.  He also casts doubt on the ""ringleader"" label, saying that Tiger was more middle management. ""He was a boss underground, but he's not a top boss. He was like a supervisor, someone who could manage the situation where we were working."" Mining researcher Makhotla Sefuli thinks it was unlikely that Tiger was at the top of the illegal mining syndicate in Stilfontein. He says those in charge never work underground. ""The illegal mining trade is like a pyramid with many tiers. We always pay attention to the bottom tier, which is the workers. They are the ones who are underground. ""But there is a second layer… they supply cash to the illegal miners. ""Then you've got the buyers… they buy [the gold] from those who are supplying cash to the illegal miners."" At the top are ""some very powerful"" people, with ""close proximity to top politicians"". These people make the most money, but do not get their hands dirty in the mines. Supang Khoaisanyane was one of those at the bottom of the pyramid and he paid with his life. The 39-year-old's body was among those discovered in the disused gold mine in January. He, like many of the others who perished, had migrated to South Africa from Lesotho. Walking into his village, Bobete, in the Thaba-Tseka district, feels like stepping back in time. The journey there is full of obstacles. After crossing a rickety bridge barely wide enough to hold our car, we are faced with a long drive up unpaved mountain roads with no safety barriers. More than once it feels likely we will not make it to the top. But when we do, the scenery is pristine. Seemingly untouched by modernity. Dozens of small, thatched huts, their walls made from mountain stone, dot the rolling green hills. Right next door to the late Supang's family home is the unfinished house he was building for his wife and three children.  Unlike most of the dwellings in the village, the house is made of cement, but it is missing a roof, windows and doors. The empty spaces are an unintentional memorial to a man who wanted to help his family. ""He left the village because he was struggling,"" his aunt Mabolokang Khoaisanyane tells me.  Next to her Supang's wife and one of his children lay down on a mattress on the floor, staring sadly into space. ""He was trying to find money in Stilfontein, to feed his family, and to put some roofing on his house,"" Ms Khoaisanyane says. The house was built with money raised from a previous work trip to South Africa by Supang - a trip that many of those from Lesotho have made over the decades drawn by the opportunities of the much richer neighbour. His aunt adds that before he left the second time, three years ago, his job prospects at home were non-existent. ""It's very terrible here, that's why he left. Because here all you can do is work on short government projects. But you work for a short time and then that's it."" This landlocked country - entirely surrounded by South Africa - is one of the poorest in the world. Unemployment stands at 30% but for young people the rate is almost 50%, according to official figures. Supang's family say they did not realise he was working as a zama zama until a relative called them to say he had died underground. They thought he had been working in construction and had not heard from him since he left Bobete in 2022. Ms Khoaisanyane says that during the phone call, they were told that what caused the deaths of most of those underground in Stilfontein was a lack of food and water. Many of the more than 240 who were rescued came out very ill. Stilfontein made global headlines late last year when the police implemented a controversial new strategy to crack down on illegal mining. They restricted the flow of food and water into the mine in an attempt to ""smoke out"" the workers, as one South African minister put it. In January, a court order forced the government to launch a rescue operation. Supang's family say they understand what he was doing was illegal but they disagree with how the authorities dealt with the situation. ""They tortured these people with hunger, not allowing food and medication to be sent down. It makes us really sad that he was down there without food for that long. We believe this is what ended his life,"" his aunt says. The dead miner's family have finally received his body and buried him near his  half-finished home. But Tiger's mother and brother are still waiting for news about him. The South African police say the search continues, though it is not clear if they have got any closer to finding him.

6/4/2025,Article,The Indian pilot set for a historic space journey on Axiom-4,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce80glkl7nno,"The Axiom Mission 4 (Ax-4), set to take off from Nasa's Kennedy Space Center in Florida next week, will be piloted by an Indian as it soars towards the International Space Station (ISS). Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla of the Indian air force is among the four-member multi-country crew of Ax-4 that will be spending two weeks on the ISS. The flight, scheduled for 10 June at 08:22 EDT (12:22GMT; 17:52IST), has generated a huge interest in India as Group Captain Shukla will only be the second Indian ever to travel to space and the first to visit the ISS. The trip comes 41 years after cosmonaut Rakesh Sharma became the first Indian to fly to space aboard a Russian Soyuz in 1984. He spent nearly eight days there. Ax-4 is led by former Nasa astronaut Peggy Whitson - a space veteran who has been commander of ISS twice, spent hundreds of days in space and done 10 space walks.  The team also includes Slawosz Uznanski-Wisniewski from Poland and Tibor Kapu from Hungary - just like the Indian astronaut, they will also be taking their countries back to space after more than four decades.  Experts say the pilot's role is key, as he would serve as second-in-command to the mission commander, assisting with spacecraft operations during launch, docking, undocking and return to Earth. The astronauts, who have been in quarantine since 25 May to prepare for the trip, addressed a press conference on Tuesday night where they showed-off Joy - a small, white toy swan they said would be ""the fifth crew member"" on Ax-4. ""We are good for the launch, we have completed all the training and the team has bonded well,"" Commander Whitson said. Describing the past year as ""nothing short of transformative"" for him, Group Captain Shukla said he did not have words to describe his excitement. ""It has been an amazing journey so far, but the best is yet to come,"" he said.  ""As I go into space, I carry not just instruments and equipment, I carry hopes and dreams of a billion hearts. ""I request all Indians to pray for the success of our mission,"" he added. The 39-year-old was among four Indian air force officers shortlisted last year to travel on the country's first-ever human space flight, scheduled for 2027. The Gaganyaan mission aims to send three astronauts to an orbit of 400km and bring them back after three days. India has also announced ambitious plans to set up a space station by 2035 and send an astronaut to the Moon by 2040. India's space agency Isro has been carrying out a number of tests to prepare for Gaganyaan. In December, it plans to send a female humanoid robot to space as part of the tests. So, officials say the mission comes as a ""unique exciting opportunity"" for Isro and has generated a lot of interest in India. The trip to ISS aboard Ax-4 - a commercial flight operated by Houston-based private company Axiom Space - is a collaborative effort between Nasa, Isro and European Space Agency (Esa). Tuesday's flight will be launched using the SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule on a Falcon 9 rocket.  Isro, which has paid 5bn rupees ($59m; £43m) to secure a seat for Group Captain Shukla and his training, says the experience he will gain during his trip to the ISS will help India immensely. ""The benefit we will get from this mission is phenomenal in terms of the training, exposure to the facilities and the experience of jointly conducting experiments in space,"" Isro Chairman V Narayanan recently said. Sudeesh Balan, Isro project director, said Group Captain Shukla had been training since August last year.  ""He's undergone rigorous training, including physical and psychological assessments, to prepare for the journey."" Born on 10 October 1985 in the northern city of Lucknow, Group Captain Shukla joined the Indian air force as a fighter pilot in 2006.  According to Axiom Space, he has over 2,000 hours of flying experience and has flown MiGs, Sukhois, Dorniers, Jaguars and Hawks. His sister Shuchi Mishra, however, told the BBC that his entry into the air force was ""accidental"". ""When he was 17 and in high school, his friend got a form to apply to the National Defence Academy. But this friend was slightly overage so he was not qualified. Not wanting to waste the form, Shubhanshu filled it up,"" Ms Mishra said. ""He was selected - and has never looked back."" Ms Mishra says their family ""is thrilled as one of ours has been chosen out of India's 1.4 billion people"" for this mission. ""We all feel so privileged and proud that he's a part of our family and that we've been a part of his journey."" Her brother, she says, is undertaking this journey for his country - for the next generation. ""He always tells people to dream big, to do something for the nation. We are hoping that his trip will inspire the next generation."" Besides piloting the mission, the Indian astronaut will have a busy schedule during his time on ISS. Considering the huge interest in the flight, Isro has said they are organising events for him to interact with Indian students and answer their questions while floating in space. ""We believe it will motivate our young minds to become passionate about space tech,"" Mr Balan said. But most of the time, the four-member crew will be conducting 60 scientific experiments, seven of which come from India.  Former Nasa scientist Mila Mitra says Isro's experiments will help improve our understanding of space and its effects on biology and micro-gravity. One of the key experiments, she explains, will investigate the impact of spaceflight on six varieties of crop seeds.  ""This project aims to help understand how crops may be grown in space for future exploration missions. After the mission, seeds will be grown for multiple generations and plants showing preferred traits will be selected for genetic analyses."" Another Isro experiment involves growing three strains of microalgae which could be used as food, fuel or even in life support systems and this will help identify the most suitable ones for growing in microgravity, she says. The Isro projects would also investigate how tardigrades - micro-animals on Earth that can survive extreme environments - would fare in space.  ""The project will examine the revival of dormant tardigrades, count the number of eggs laid and hatched during a mission, and compare space-flown versus ground control populations,"" Ms Mitra says. The other experiments aim to identify how muscle loss occurs in space and how it can be treated; and the physical and cognitive impact of using computer screens in microgravity.  ""The research will study how gaze fixation and rapid eye movements are affected by being in space, and how this may affect an astronaut's stress and wellbeing. The results could influence future spacecraft computer design and interaction,"" she says. Follow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook. Copyright 2025 BBC.

6/4/2025,Article,Why Labour is strengthening ties with China after years of rollercoaster relations,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c071jr159p0o,"Listen to Ankur read this article The sprawling city of Chongqing in southwestern China is an incredible sight. Built on mountainous terrain and crisscrossed by rivers, it is connected by vast elevated roads. Trains even run through some buildings. TikTokers have begun documenting their commutes in the striking urban architecture, generating millions of likes and much hype.  But it is also where, on a somewhat quieter trip, mayors and their deputies from the UK recently visited - the largest British civic delegation to go there in history. The whole trip, which took place in March, received substantial Chinese media coverage, despite flying more under the radar in the UK. The impression it left on some of the politicians who travelled there was vast. ""[The city is] what happens if you take the planning department and just say 'yes' to everything,"" reflects Howard Dawber, deputy London mayor for business. ""It's just amazing."" The group travelled to southern Chinese cities, spoke to Chinese mayors and met Chinese tech giants. So impressed was one deputy mayor that, on returning home, they bought a mobile phone from Chinese brand Honor (a stark contrast from the days the UK banned Huawei technology from its 5G networks, just a few years ago). Roughly half-a-dozen deals were signed on the back of the trip. The West Midlands, for example, agreed to establish a new UK headquarters in Birmingham for Chinese energy company EcoFlow.  But the visit was as much about diplomacy as it was trade, says East Midlands deputy mayor Nadine Peatfield, who attended. ""There was a real hunger and appetite to rekindle those relationships."" To some, it was reminiscent of the ""golden era"" of UK-China relations, a time when then-Prime Minister David Cameron and Chinese President Xi Jinping shared a basket of fish and chips and a pint. Those days have long felt far away. Political ties with China deteriorated under former UK Conservative Prime Ministers Boris Johnson, Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss. The last UK prime minister to visit China was Theresa May, in 2018.  The recent delegation - and the talk of Sir Keir Starmer possibly visiting China later this year -  all suggests a turning point in relations. But to what greater intent? The course correction seemed to begin with the closed-door meeting between Sir Keir and Chinese President Xi in Brazil last November. The prime minister signalled that Britain would look to cooperate with China on climate change and business. Since then, Labour's cautious pursuit of China has primarily focused on the potential financial upsides.  In January, Chancellor Rachel Reeves co-chaired the first UK-China economic summit since 2019, in Beijing. Defending her trip, she said: ""Choosing not to engage with China is no choice at all."" Reeves claimed re-engagement with China could boost the UK economy by £1bn, with agreements worth £600m to the UK over the next five years — partially achieved through lifting barriers that restrict exports to China. Soon after, Energy Secretary Ed Miliband resumed formal climate talks with China. Miliband said it would be ""negligence"" to future generations not to have dialogue with the country, given it is the world's biggest carbon emitter. Labour simply describes its approach as ""grown-up"". But it all appears to be a marked shift from the last decade of UK-China relations. During the so-called ""golden era"", from 2010, the UK's policy towards China was dominated by the Treasury, focusing on economic opportunities and appearing to cast almost all other issues, including human rights or security, aside.  By September 2023, however, Rishi Sunak said he was ""acutely aware of the particular threat to our open and democratic way of life"" posed by China. Labour claimed in its manifesto that it would bring a ""long-term and strategic approach"". China has a near monopoly on extracting and refining rare earth minerals, which are critical to manufacturing many high-tech and green products. For example, car batteries are often reliant on lithium, while indium is a rare metal used for touch screens. This makes China a vital link in global supply chains. ""China's influence is likely to continue to grow substantially globally, especially with the US starting to turn inwards,"" says Dr William Matthews, a China specialist at Chatham House think tank. ""The world will become more Chinese, and whilst that is difficult for any Western government, there needs to be sensible engagement from the get-go.""  Andrew Cainey, a director of the UK National Committee on China, an educational non-profit organisation, says: ""China has changed a lot since the Covid-19 pandemic. To have elected officials not having seen it, it's a no brainer for them to get back on the ground"". Certainly many in the UK's China-watching community believe that contact is an essential condition to gain a clearer-eyed view of the opportunities posed by China, but also the challenges. The opportunities, some experts say, are largely economic, climate and education-related. Or as Kerry Brown, Professor of Chinese Studies at King's College London, puts it: ""China is producing information, analysis and ways of doing things that we can learn from"". He points to the intellectual, technological, AI, and life sciences opportunities. Not engaging with China would be to ignore the realities of geopolitics in the 21st century, in Dr Matthew's view, given that it is the world's second largest economy. However he also believes that engagement comes with certain risks. Charles Parton, who spent 22 years of his diplomatic career working in or on China, raises questions about the UK's economic and national security. For example, the government is reportedly weighing up proposals for a Chinese company to supply wind turbines for an offshore windfarm in the North Sea. Mr Parton warns against allowing China access to the national grid: ""It wouldn't be difficult in a time of high tension to say, 'by the way, we can turn off all your wind farms'"". But earlier this year, the China Chamber of Commerce to the EU issued a statement expressing concern over the ""politicisation"" of deals between wind developers in Europe and Chinese turbine suppliers. James Sullivan, director of Cyber and Tech at defence think tank Rusi, notes there are also some questions around cyberspace. ""China's activities in cyberspace appear to be more strategically and politically focused compared to previous opportunistic activities,"" he says. As for defence, the UK's recently published defence review describes China as a ""sophisticated and persistent challenge"", with Chinese technology and its proliferation to other countries ""already a leading challenge for the UK"". Ken McCallum, MI5 director general, meanwhile, has previously warned of a sustained campaign on an ""epic scale"" of Chinese espionage abroad. But Prof Brown pushes back on some concerns about espionage, saying some media narratives about this are a ""fairytale"". Beijing has always dismissed accusations of espionage as attempts to ""smear"" China. Sir Keir and his team will no doubt be closely monitoring how this is all viewed by Washington DC. Last month, President Donald Trump's trade advisor Peter Navarro described Britain as ""an all too compliant servant of Communist China"", urging the UK against deepening economic ties. ""When it comes to foreign policy towards China, America's influence on policy will be quite substantive compared with say continental Europe,"" says Dr Yu Jie, senior research fellow on China at Chatham House think tank. Most analysts I speak to in both the UK and China are still clear on the need for the two countries to get back in the same room, even if they differ on where to draw the line: in which areas should Westminster cooperate and where should it stay clear. These red lines have not yet been drawn, and experts say that without some kind of playbook, it is difficult for businesses and elected officials to know how to engage. ""You can only keep firefighting specific issues for so long without developing a systematic plan,"" warns Mr Cainey. Certain thorny issues have arisen, including Chinese investments in the UK. For example in April when the government seized control of British Steel from its former Chinese owner Jingye, to prevent it from being closed down, Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds admitted that he would ""look at a Chinese firm in a different way"" when considering investment in the UK steel industry. China's foreign ministry spokesperson, Lin Jian, warned that Labour should avoid ""linking it to security issues, so as not to impact the confidence of Chinese enterprises in going to the UK"". After Starmer met Xi last year, he said the government's approach would be ""rooted in the national interests of the UK"", but acknowledged areas of disagreement with China, including on human rights, Taiwan and Russia's war in Ukraine. Securing the release of pro-democracy activist and British citizen Jimmy Lai from a Hong Kong prison is, he has said, a ""priority"" for the government.  Labour's manifesto broadly pledged: ""We will cooperate where we can, compete where we need to, and challenge where we must."" What is still lacking, however, is the fine print. Asked about the British government's longer-term strategy, Mr Parton replied: ""No.10 doesn't have a strategy."" He tells me he has some specific advice: ""Go with your eyes open,"" he says. ""But have a clear idea of what needs protecting, and a willingness to take some short-term financial hits to protect long-term national security."" Labour has suggested that some clarity on their approach will be provided through the delayed China ""audit"", a cross-government exercise launched last year, which will review the UK's relations with China. The audit is due to be published this month, but many doubt that it will resolve matters. ""If we see a visit from Starmer to Beijing, that will be an indication that the two sides have actually agreed with something, and that they would like to change and improve their bilateral relationship,"" says Dr Yu. But many people in Westminster remain China-sceptic. And even if the audit helps Britain better define what it wants out of its relationship with China, the question remains, do MPs and businesses have the China-related expertise to get the best out of it? According to Ruby Osman, China analyst at the Tony Blair Institute, there is an urgent need to build the UK's China capabilities in a more holistic way, focusing on diversifying the UK's points of contact with China. ""If we want to be in a position where we are not just listening to what Beijing and Washington want, there needs to be investment in the talent pipeline coming into government, but also think tanks and businesses who work with China,"" she argues. And if that's the case, then irrespective of whether closer ties with China is viewed as a security threat, an economic opportunity, or something in between, the UK might be in a better position to engage with the country.

6/4/2025,Article,Kenyan author prosecuted for writing a book about president's daughter,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgnrlp6vgzo,"Kenyan free-speech advocates and lawyers have condemned the prosecution of the author of an unauthorised biography of Kenyan President William Ruto's daughter. Charlene Ruto accused Webster Ochora Elijah of ""misusing"" her name by writing the book without first seeking permission from her. On Tuesday, the author was arrested and charged with impersonation over the book titled Beyond the Name: Charlene Ruto and the Youth Uprising. He pleaded not guilty and was released on bail. Ms Ruto told journalists that she had reported the matter to the police and was following legal procedures. She is listed as the complainant on the charge sheet. The charge alleges that the accused published the book on or before 22 May, alongside others who are yet to be charged, with intention to defraud. The president's daughter has not complained about the contents of the book, just that it was written without her permission. But critics say this is not illegal. Politician and lawyer Willis Otieno said to ""criminalise authorship"" was misusing the ""state machinery in defence of fragile egos"". Literary critic Mbugua Ngunjiri said the author did ""nothing wrong"", giving an example of an unauthorised biography of former President Uhuru Kenyatta, in 2014, where the ""author did not need to consult"". ""A million writers can write 'her book' and it will be perfectly legal. The only time Charlene would be justified to go after the author is if he misrepresented her in any way,"" he posted on Facebook. The president's daughter told journalists that there was a ""bad culture"" in Kenya ""where we misuse people's names and we get away with it and that is not right"".   She said the author had not sought permission from her and it did not matter whether the book was ""positive"" about her. ""The gentleman never came to me with a suggestion that he wants to write a book on my behalf and for me that is a misappropriate use of my name,"" she said. The self-published book, by a little-known author, aged 25, has not been widely distributed and there is not much publicly available information about its contents. It is not available online. His legal team have argued that his work did not constitute a crime. Lawyer Kennedy Mong'are told local media that he had previously written books about public figures, including on veteran politician Raila Odinga and US President Donald Trump. Another lawyer, Evan Ondieki, said that high-ranking government figures should expect public scrutiny and that the arrest undermined Kenya's democratic values. ""You cannot be so thick-skinned that the use of your name or image becomes an offence,"" he stated. In April, a secondary school teacher was charged for impersonating another daughter of President Ruto, by pretending to be June Ruto on Facebook.  Charlene Ruto is a high-profile figure who has in the past been likened to a version of Ivanka Trump, daughter of the US president. She has often been a guest at public events, and in the past met leaders across the country and attended international forums. In 2022, she denied that public money was being used to fund what she called the ""Office of the First Daughter"". The court case has amplified concerns about restrictions on free expression, particularly following the recent detention of software developer Rose Njeri. Njeri was arrested on Friday for creating a tool that helped citizens oppose the government's annual finance bill. She was charged with cyber-crime and computer misuse on Tuesday and freed on bail until 20 June when the court will determine whether she will answer the charges. She has since thanked Kenyans for raising their voices against her ""ludicrous"" arrest and detention.

6/4/2025,Article,US Navy to rename ship honouring gay rights leader and veteran Harvey Milk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1w344zzn5wo,"The US Navy plans to remove the name of gay rights leader and Navy veteran Harvey Milk from one of its ships, and may change the titles of other vessels honouring civil rights leaders. The plans were outlined in documents obtained by BBC's US partner CBS News that show a timeline for when the renaming of USNS Harvey Milk would be shared with the public. It comes during Pride Month in June, an annual commemoration of the LGBT community that coincides with the anniversary of the Stonewall riots in 1969. The directive also comes amid a broader movement by the Trump administration to curb programmes that promote diversity and inclusion across federal departments. Sean Parnell, a spokesman for the Pentagon, told CBS on Tuesday that the renaming of the USNS Harvey Milk is to realign the US military with the Trump administration's goal of ""re-establishing the warrior culture"" in the armed forces. The memo calls for Navy Secretary John Phelan to select a new name for the fleet oiler. That name change would then be communicated to other senior US Navy officials after a legal review. It also outlines other vessels recommended for renaming, including the USNS Ruth Bader Ginsburg, named after the late liberal Supreme Court justice, and the USNS Harriet Tubman, named after the American slavery abolitionist. Harvey Milk is known for being the first openly gay man to be elected to public office in California, winning a seat on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors. He was assassinated 10 months after he was sworn in. The push to rename the USNS Harvey Milk comes after a directive issued by Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth earlier this year instructing US military personnel to stop hosting events tied to heritage or awareness months.  This directive banned resources and manpower from being used on events like Pride Month, Black History Month and Women's History Month, citing concerns that they would undermine unity in the military. US President Donald Trump also issued executive orders earlier this year that banned diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) in the government, and that made it official US policy to recognise two sexes, male and female. Supporters of DEI programmes say they address historical underrepresentation and discrimination against certain groups, including racial minorities, but critics say such initiatives are themselves discriminatory. The move to rename the Harvey Milk and other ships has been criticised by prominent Democrats, including former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi.  In a statement to CBS, Pelosi called the move a ""vindictive erasure of those who fought to break down barriers for all to chase the American dream"".

6/4/2025,Article,TikTok blocks searches for extreme thinness 'skinnytok' hashtag,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gr6q6256do,"TikTok is preventing users searching for ""skinnytok"" - a hashtag which critics say directs people towards content which ""idolises extreme thinness."" Content associated with the hashtag includes videos showing people's work-out routines or what they eat in a day.  TikTok said it had ""blocked search results for #skinnytok since it has become linked to unhealthy weight loss content."" People using the hashtag will now be redirected to mental health support resources instead. Tom Quinn, from the eating disorder charity, Beat, welcomed the move saying ""skinnytok"" and related content could have ""devastating"" impacts on ""struggling"" people. However, he stressed there was more to do. ""We know that users will very often find workarounds to content blocks and there will still be damaging content which isn't shared under the ""skinnytok"" umbrella, which TikTok and other social media platforms must now address,"" he told BBC News. According to the US-based National Alliance for Eating Disorders, the skinnytok hashtag has more than half a million posts associated with it. It says the hashtag includes content such as low-calorie recipes which on the face of it appear to promote healthy lifestyle advice. But the organisation says, in reality, it ""glorifies thinness and vilifies weight gain"" and ""promotes disordered eating behaviours."" The  trend has caused particular alarm in France, where experts have warned of how social media can push vulnerable young people towards developing eating disorders. ""The patients are completely indoctrinated -- and my 45-minute weekly consultation is no match for spending hours every day on TikTok,"" the nutritionist Carole Copti told the AFP news agency. The blocking of the hashtag has been celebrated by France's digital minister, who wrote on social media that ""skinnytok is over"" thanks to lobbying by European politicians.  In its statement, TikTok said it regularly reviewed its safety measures to ""address evolving risks"". ""We continue to restrict videos from teen accounts and provide health experts and information in TikTok Search,"" it added. It is not the first time TikTok has been forced to take action over content which raised body image concerns. In March, it blocked so-called ""chubby filters"" - a viral tool which made people appear overweight. Sign up for our Tech Decoded newsletter to follow the world's top tech stories and trends.

6/4/2025,Article,South African politician sacked over visit to fugitive pastor,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c308r56rzdmo,"A top official in one of South Africa's biggest political parties has been sacked after he visited a controversial Malawian pastor in April. Floyd Shivambu has been removed as secretary-general of the uMkhonto weSizwe (MK) party barely six months into the job after he attended an Easter service at self-proclaimed pastor Shepherd Bushiri's church. Mr Bushiri, from Malawi, was one of southern Africa's best known preachers when he was arrested and charged with fraud in South Africa in 2020. After being released on bail, he managed to flee to his home country in unclear circumstances. South Africa has been trying to extradite him ever since. Mr Bushiri denies any wrongdoing and, together with his wife Mary, has applied to review a judgment that approved their extradition to South Africa, according to local news site Eyewitness News.  The MK party, which was founded by former President Jacob Zuma, said in a press conference on Wednesday that Mr Shivambu's removal came after his actions ""were found to be against the spirit and prescripts of the MK party's constitution"". ""The president and national officials were left with no other option but to act swiftly,"" said MK national chair Nathi Nhleko. He added that the trip ""was not an officially sanctioned programme of the organisation"". However, Mr Shivambu remains a member of the party and will instead represent MK in the National Assembly. Reacting to news of his demotion, Mr Shivambu said he ""fully accepts"" the decision taken by the party and looked forward to taking up his new role in parliament. Mr Shivambu joined the MK party in August last year from the rival Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) and was later appointed secretary-general - one of the party's top positions. Under the leadership of former President Zuma, the newly formed MK party came third in last year's elections - a major factor in the governing ANC losing its majority for the first time since democratic elections were introduced in 1994. Mr Shivambu was widely criticised in April when he reposted footage shared on X by Mr Bushiri showing the self-proclaimed pastor asking hundreds of worshippers at his Jesus Nation church to welcome the South African politician. The politician, in his retweet, also praised Mr Bushiri for his ""good work"" and ""for hosting us"".  Mr Bushiri is a millionaire who set up churches in several African countries. He is accused of preying on poor people who were desperate to improve their lives by selling merchandise including ""miracle oil"". The self-proclaimed prophet claims to have cured people of HIV, made the blind see, changed the fortunes of the impoverished and, on at least one occasion, walked on air. Mr Bushiri has also been charged with rape. He and his wife have denied any wrongdoing. Sanet Solomon, an analyst based at South Africa's University of the Free State, said Mr Shivambu's removal was ""expected"" given the negative publicity his visit to Malawi garnered. ""His removal does, however, raise questions and concerns around leadership retention and succession planning as the party is preparing to welcome its sixth secretary general in its second year of existence. These changes further exacerbate concerns around the party's stability,"" she told the BBC. Mr Shivambu has been the MK party's longest-serving secretary general since the party's formation in December 2023. Ms Solomon added that Shivambu's ""leadership style"" and ""tension with other party leaders"" were contributing factors in his ultimate downfall within the party. The internal conflict between Mr Shivambu and some MK party leaders played out publicly when Zuma's daughter, Duduzile, was forced to apologise after calling him ""useless"" and ""the worst thing that happened to MK"" in a post on X earlier this year. ""It would not be surprising if he [Shivambu] soon announces his departure from the party,"" Ms Solomon predicted.  Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

6/5/2025,Article,Trump and Musk enter bitter feud - and Washington buckles up,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/c3wd2215q08o,"What happens when the richest person and the most powerful politician have a knock-down, drag-out fight? The world may be about to find out. A disagreement between Elon Musk and Donald Trump started at a simmer last week, began bubbling on Wednesday and is now in full-on boil. And like everything these two men do, it is all spilling out into public view. These two men have two of the world's biggest megaphones, and they clearly enjoy using them. In remarks at the Oval Office on Thursday afternoon, Trump sounded a bit like a spurned lover. He expressed surprise at Musk's criticism of his ""big, beautiful"" tax and spending legislation. He pushed back against the notion that he would have lost last year's presidential election without Musk's hundreds of millions of dollars in support. And he said Musk was only changing his tune now because his car company, Tesla, will be hurt by the Republican push to end electric vehicle tax credits. Musk took to his social media site, X, with a very Generation X response for his 220 million followers: ""Whatever"". He said he didn't care about the car subsidies, he wanted to shrink the national debt, which he says is an existential threat to the nation. He called Trump ""ungrateful"" for his help last year and insisted that Democrats would have prevailed without him. Musk and Trump had formed a powerful but unlikely alliance , culminating in the tech billionaire having a key position of budget-slashing authority in the Trump administration. Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, or Doge, became one of the biggest stories of Trump's first 100 days, as it shuttered entire agencies and dismissed thousands of government workers. It wasn't long, however, before speculation began over when – and how - the two outsized personalities would ultimately fall out. For a while, it seemed like those predictions were off the mark. Trump stood by Musk even as the latter's popularity dropped, as he feuded with administration officials and as he became a liability in several key elections earlier this year. Every time it appeared there would be a break, Musk would pop up in the Oval Office, or the Cabinet room or on the president's Air Force One flight to Mar-a-Lago. When Musk's 130 days as a ""special government employee"" ended last week, the two had a chummy Oval Office send-off, with a golden key to the White House and hints that Musk might someday return. It's safe to say that any invitation has been rescinded and the locks have been changed. ""Elon and I had a great relationship,"" Trump said on Thursday – a comment notable for its use of the past tense. There had been some thought that Trump's surprise announcement on Wednesday night of a new travel ban, additional sanctions on Harvard and a conspiracy-laced administration investigation of former President Joe Biden were all efforts to change the subject from Musk's criticism. The White House and its allies in Congress seemed careful not to further antagonise him after his earlier comments. Then Trump spoke out and … so much for that. Now the question is where the dispute goes next. Congressional Republicans could find it harder to keep their members behind Trump's bill with Musk providing rhetorical – and, perhaps financial – air for those who break ranks.  Trump, who takes pride in being a devastating counterpuncher, will have plenty of opportunity to lay into Musk. What will happen to Musk's Doge allies still in the Trump administration or government contracts to Musk-related companies or Biden-era investigations into Musk's business dealings? ""The easiest way to save money in our budget, billions and billions of dollars, is to terminate Elon's governmental subsidies and contracts,"" Trump posted menacingly on his own social media website. If Trump turns the machinery of government against Musk, the tech billionaire will feel pain. Tesla's stock price slipped on Thursday.  But Musk also has near limitless resources to respond, including by funding insurgent challengers to Republicans in next year's elections and primaries. He may not win a fight against the whole of Trump's government, but he could exact a high political price. Meanwhile, Democrats are on the sidelines, wondering how to respond. Few seem willing to welcome Musk, a former donor to their party, back into the fold. But there's also the old adage that the enemy of an enemy is a friend. ""It's a zero-sum game,"" Liam Kerr, a Democratic strategist, told Politico. ""Anything that he does that moves more toward Democrats hurts Republicans."" At the very least, Democrats seem happy to stand back and let the two men exchange blows. And until they abandon this fight, the din is likely to drown out everything else in American politics. But don't expect this spat to end anytime soon. ""Trump has 3.5 years left as president,"" Musk wrote on X, ""but I will be around for 40-plus years."" Copyright 2025 BBC.

The elephant, named Plai Biang Lek, is known by locals for entering people's homes in search of food. He ventured about one kilometre from the park entrance gate to the store. Shopkeepers say Biang munched down nine bags of sweet rice crackers, a sandwich and some bananas before they managed to usher him out. Copyright 2025 BBC.

6/5/2025,Article,"Trump's new ban dodges pitfalls faced by last attempt, experts say",https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/cd7gp8l1241o,"US President Donald Trump has issued a sweeping new travel ban for people from 12 countries, revisiting a hallmark policy of his first term in office. There are some key differences, however. The original travel ban suffered a series of legal defeats. This time, the policy appears to have been designed to avoid the same pitfalls. Its predecessor, which targeted seven predominantly Muslim countries and was dubbed the ""Muslim ban"" by critics, was ordered just a week after Trump took office in 2017, during his first term in the White House. The ban was amended twice to overcome court challenges, after opponents argued it was unconstitutional and illegal because it discriminated against travellers based on their religion. A scaled-back version was eventually upheld by the US Supreme Court in 2018, which this new ban closely resembles. Legal experts told the BBC that it appeared Trump had learned lessons from his first attempt. Christi Jackson, an expert in US immigration law at the London firm Laura Devine Immigration, said the new ban was more legally robust as a result. While the first lacked ""clarity"", the new restrictions were ""wider in scope"" and had ""clearly defined"" exemptions, she said. While there are some similarities in the nations chosen by the 2017 ban and the 2025 ban, Muslim-majority states are not the express target of the latest order. Barbara McQuade, professor of law at the University of Michigan and former US attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan, told the BBC World Service's Newshour programme that, on this basis, it seemed likely to win the approval of the Supreme Court if it was ever referred up to that level. The 12 countries subject to the harshest restrictions from 9 June are mainly in the Middle East, Africa and the Caribbean, including Afghanistan, Iran and Somalia. There will be partial restrictions on travellers from another seven countries, including Cuban and Venezuelan nationals. Trump said the strength of the restrictions would be graded against the severity of the perceived threat, including from terrorism. But besides Iran, none of the 12 countries hit by the outright ban are named on the US government's state sponsors of terrorism list. Trump cited Sunday's incident in Boulder, Colorado, in which a man was accused of throwing Molotov cocktails at demonstrators attending a march for Israeli hostages, in a video announcing the ban on X. The alleged attacker was an Egyptian national. However, Egypt does not appear on either list.  Trump also specified high rates of people overstaying their visas as a reason for listing certain countries. However, Steven D Heller, an immigration lawyer based in the US, said there was a ""lack of clarity"" over what threshold had to be met by a country's overstaying rate in order for that country to be placed on Trump's ban list. That could be the basis for a successful legal challenge, he suggested. ""If they're relying on this notion of excessive overstay rates... they have to define what that actually means,"" he told the BBC. But he noted that existing US law gave the president broad powers over immigration policy. Unlike the first ban, which was to last for only 90 to 120 days, today's order has no end date. It has been met with dismay in the targeted countries.  Venezuela has described the Trump administration as ""supremacists who think they own the world"", though Somalia has pledged to ""engage in dialogue to address the concerns raised"". The original ban spurred mass protests and sowed chaos at US airports.  It was repealed in 2021 by Trump's successor, President Joe Biden, who called the policy ""a stain on our national conscience"". Immigration lawyer Shabnam Lotfi, who challenged the previous travel ban, said it would be an ""uphill battle"" to overturn the new one.  ""The president does have the authority to determine who is admissible to the US,"" she said, adding that because of the way the ban had been written, it was ""harder to find a huge group of people that could file a class-action lawsuit"". ""They've put more thought into it."" Ms Lotfi noted that the new restrictions could have consequences for students and other visa applicants abroad. ""Students who are stuck in administrative processing are impacted. So are winners of the diversity visa lottery who paid fees and went to interviews - they're unlikely to get visas now,"" she said. ""Even EB-5 investors - people who've put over $1 million into the US economy - are affected. And H-1B visa holders stuck abroad, waiting to return to their US employers, could also be blocked.""

6/5/2025,Article,Supreme Court rules for heterosexual woman in discrimination case,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/cr7zlr1rdpdo,"The US Supreme Court has sided with an Ohio woman who alleged she was discriminated against at her job because she was heterosexual. The justices voted unanimously in a ruling focused on evidence standards that could make it easier to file similar ""reverse discrimination"" cases.  Marlean Ames said that despite working for the Ohio Department of Youth Services for more than 20 years, she was denied a promotion and then demoted. She had appealed to the court to challenge the standards required to prove her case. The decision effectively lowers the burden of proof required for people who are members of a majority group - such as white or heterosexual people - to make discrimination claims. US court precedent covering some states, including Ohio, had required that members of majority groups show additional ""background circumstances"" to prove their case or evidence showing a pattern of discrimination.  The court has now ruled that the standard of evidence for a discrimination claim should be the same, regardless of a person's identity. Justice Kentaji Brown Jackson, one of the court's liberals, wrote the official opinion, with concurring opinions from conservatives Justice Clarence Thomas and Justice Neil Gorsuch.  The court concluded that anti-discrimination and equal protection laws were meant to apply to all Americans. ""By establishing the same protections for every 'individual'—without regard to that individual's membership in a minority or majority group—Congress left no room for courts to impose special requirements on majority-group plaintiffs alone,"" she wrote. The court did not consider Ms Ames' original discrimination suit. The justices said it was up to lower courts that had initially ruled against her to evaluate the case under the clarified evidence standards.  Legal experts say employment discrimination and bias cases can be difficult to demonstrate, regardless of the burden of proof. Ms Ames had said she had positive performance reviews, but a promotion she sought was given to a lesbian. She was then demoted and her job was given to a gay man.  In a lawsuit, she argued her employer had a preference for LGBTQ staff members and denied her opportunities because she identifies as straight. Lower courts ruled that she had failed to provide sufficient evidence of her claim, propelling the burden of proof question to the Supreme Court.  At a February hearing, justices on both sides ideologically appeared sympathetic to her argument. Copyright 2025 BBC.

6/5/2025,Article,Why are these 12 countries on Trump's travel-ban list?,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/cz6329yvwdvo,"A travel ban issued on Wednesday by US President Donald Trump is set to primarily affect countries in Africa and the Middle East.  Twelve countries face full bans, which will come into force on Monday. People from a further seven nations are facing partial restrictions.  Trump has depicted it as a matter of national security. He cited a recent attack on members of Colorado's Jewish community, which was allegedly carried out by an Egyptian national. Egypt itself is not on the banned list. Other reasons cited include alleged breaking of US visa rules by people from the countries in question. Here is a closer look at some of the president's reasoning. A range of accusations have been made against Afghanistan in a presidential proclamation signed by Trump. The document highlights that the Taliban, which controls the country, is a Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT) group.  The move comes just weeks after the Trump administration appeared to signal that it believed the situation had improved in Afghanistan, when it announced the end of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Afghans living in the US. Afghanistan is further accused by Trump of lacking a ""competent or co-operative"" central authority for issuing passports or civil documents. As with other countries on Trump's list, the issue of Afghan nationals overstaying their visas is also cited. Trump's proclamation identifies Iran as a state sponsor of terrorism - a longstanding charge that the Middle Eastern nation has previously rejected.  The US has previously censured Tehran, Iran's capital, for its alleged sponsorship of proxy groups operating in the region, such as Hamas and Hezbollah. The new proclamation from Trump says the country is ""the source of significant terrorism around the world"", does not co-operate with the US on security risks and has ""historically failed to accept back its removable nationals"". The move comes amid diplomatic wrangling between the two sides over the creation of a new deal over Iran's nuclear weapon-building capabilities. Similar reasons are given in the case of Somalia. The east African country is branded by Trump as a ""terrorist safe haven"".  Like Iran, it is also accused of failing to accept its nationals when removed from the US. However, a further point was made by Trump: ""Somalia stands apart from other countries in the degree to which its government lacks command and control of its territory, which greatly limits the effectiveness of its national capabilities in a variety of respects."" Somalia's internationally-based government faces a significant challenge from armed Islamists. It has pledged to ""engage in dialogue to address the concerns raised"" by Trump. Libya, in north Africa, is cited for its ""historical terrorist presence"", which is painted as a security threat to Americans. Libya and Somalia are also among the countries on Trump's list which have been criticised for their perceived incompetence at issuing passports. The document highlights that ""hundreds of thousands of illegal Haitian aliens flooded into the United States during the Biden Administration"".  Trump points to various perceived risks that this has entailed - including the creation of ""criminal networks"" and high visa overstay rates. Data from the US Census Bureau suggested more than 852,000 Haitians were living in the US in February 2024, though it does not give a breakdown of when those migrants arrived.  Many came after a devastating earthquake in 2010, or after fleeing gang violence that took hold in the Caribbean nation. The US president also points to a lack of central authority in Haiti for matters including law enforcement.  These countries are solely accused by Trump of having relatively high visa overstay rates.  The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) defines an ""overstay"" as a person who remains in the US beyond their authorised period of admission, with no evidence of any extension. The ""rate"" signals the proportion of people who overstayed. The central African nation Chad is singled out for showing a ""a blatant disregard for United States immigration laws"".  The document highlights an overstay rate of 49.54% by Chadians on business or tourist visas in 2023, citing a DHS report. Congo-Brazzaville and Equatorial Guinea have equivalent rates of 29.63% and 21.98% respectively. But these rates are lower than Laos, which faces a lesser restriction.  Myanmar - referred to as Burma in the Trump proclamation - is similarly accused of a high visa overstay rates.  As with others on the list, including Iran, the country is further accused of not co-operating with the US to accept deported Burmese nationals. For each of these countries, the first allegation made by Trump is that they have questionable competence at issuing passports and civil documents.  Eritrea and Sudan are further accused of having relatively high visa overstay rates. Eritrea is also blamed for failing to make the criminal records of its national available to the US, and of refusing to accept deported nationals. As with Somalia, Yemen is also accused of lacking control over its own land. Trump's proclamation highlights that it is the site of active US military operations. The US has been combating Houthis, who have seized much of the north and west of the country during an ongoing civil war.

6/5/2025,Article,Chad halts US visas in revenge for Trump travel ban,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/cyvm2j32pvmo,"The central African nation of Chad says it is suspending all visas to US citizens as a matter of ""reciprocity"", after learning that it is one of a dozen countries whose nationals are banned from travelling to the US. ""Chad has neither planes to offer nor billions of dollars to give, but Chad has its dignity and pride,"" continued President Mahamat Idriss Déby Itno in a Facebook post (in French) on Thursday. Africa is the continent worst affected by the travel ban announced by US President Donald Trump, with seven of the 12 countries on the list. It is set to come into effect on Monday. The order prohibits people from Chad, Congo-Brazzaville, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Libya, Somalia and Sudan - as well as Afghanistan, Myanmar, Haiti, Iran and Yemen - from entering the US. In addition, there will be travel restrictions on nationals of Burundi, Sierra Leone, Togo, Cuba, Laos, Turkmenistan and Venezuela - they will no longer be able to travel to the US on certain visas. ""We will not allow people to enter our country who wish to do us harm,"" Trump said in a video posted on X.  The US president said the list could be revised if ""material improvements"" were made and additional countries could be added as ""threats emerge around the world"". The White House said these ""common-sense restrictions"" would ""protect Americans from dangerous foreign actors"". Somalia was quick to react to the travel ban, immediately pledging to work with the US to address any security issues. In a statement, Somali ambassador to the US, Dahir Hassan Abdi, said his country ""values its longstanding relationship"" with America. Chad did not disguise its dismay, and in addition to the president's stern words, its Foreign Minister Abdoulaye Sabre Fadoul told the AFP news agency his government was ""surprised by this announcement and even more by the terrorism-related reason [which] completely disregards Chad's commitment and results in this area"". The African Union said it was ""concerned about the potential negative impact"" of the measures and called on the US to adopt ""a more consultative approach... with the countries concerned."" BBC Tigrinya has spoken to several Eritreans who are alarmed by the ban. ""As Eritreans, we've already suffered under our regime at home and now we're facing the same hardship under Trump's immigration policies. We've endured so much pain,"" one man told the BBC on condition of anonymity.  Eritrea is a one-party state where President Isaias Afwerki has been in power since it won independence from Ethiopia in 1993 after a bitter 30-year struggle. Young Eritreans are subject to compulsory military service, prompting many thousands to flee the country and seek refuge elsewhere. Another Eritrean woman said she worried that she and her children would no longer be able to join her husband who is already living in the US. ""We've waited so long and done everything legally, but now we're left in limbo. No-one is giving us clear answers,"" she told the BBC. In a video posted to his Truth Social website, Trump said the recent alleged terror attack in Boulder, Colorado ""underscored the extreme dangers"" posed by foreign nationals who had not been ""properly vetted"". However, the suspect in that attack is an Egyptian national and Egypt is not one of the affected countries. According to the White House explanation of the travel ban, countries such as Libya, Somalia and Sudan lack competent authorities to issue passports or civil documents and conduct ""appropriate screening measures"". All three are currently embroiled in civil wars. In addition, the White House said: ""A persistent terrorist threat also emanates from Somalia's territory"" and there was a ""historical terrorist presence within Libya's territory"". The other African countries affected had high rates of people overstaying their visas, ranging from 15% in Togo to 70% for some types of visa for nationals of Equatorial Guinea.  The ban takes effect on 9 June, a cushion that avoids the chaos that unfolded at airports nationwide when a similar measure took effect with virtually no notice eight years ago. Visas issued before that date will not be revoked, the order said. There will be exemptions for dual nationals and athletes in major sporting events such as the 2026 men's football World Cup and the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. The travel ban fulfils a promise Trump made during his 2024 election campaign but is likely to be challenged in court.  He signed a similar order in 2017, during his first term in office. It featured some of the same countries as his latest order, including Libya, Somalia and Iran. Critics called that a ""Muslim ban"" as the seven countries initially listed were Muslim majority. The White House revised the policy, ultimately adding two non-Muslim majority countries, North Korea and Venezuela. This was upheld by the Supreme Court in 2018. President Joe Biden, who succeeded Trump, repealed the ban in 2021, calling it ""a stain on our national conscience"".

6/5/2025,Article,What we know about Trump's latest travel ban,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/cx271g270v7o,"Donald Trump has signed a ban on travel to the US from 12 countries, citing national security risks. There are also seven additional countries whose nationals will face partial travel restrictions. The US president said the list could be revised if ""material improvements"" were made, while other countries could be added as ""threats emerge around the world"".  It is the second time he has ordered a ban on travel from certain countries. He signed a similar order in 2017 during his first term in office. Trump has signed a proclamation banning travel to the US from nationals of 12 countries: Nationals from these countries will not be allowed to enter the US unless they qualify for an exemption.  There are an additional seven countries whose nationals face partial travel restrictions:  Those under the partial restrictions will not be able to travel to the US with certain visas. The ban takes effect on Monday at 00:01 EDT (04:01 GMT), a cushion that avoids the chaos that unfolded at US airports when a similar measure took effect with virtually no notice eight years ago.  No end date has been provided. The order calls for periodic review. The White House said these ""common sense restrictions"" would ""protect Americans from dangerous foreign actors"". In a video posted to his Truth Social website, Trump said the recent alleged terror attack in Boulder, Colorado ""underscored the extreme dangers"" posed by foreign nationals who had not been ""properly vetted"". Twelve people were injured in Colorado on Sunday when a man attacked a group gathering in support of Israeli hostages, throwing two incendiary devices and using a makeshift flamethrower. The man accused of carrying out the attack has been identified as an Egyptian national, but Egypt is not included on the list of banned countries. Trump has close ties with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who has in the past been described by the US president as his ""favourite dictator"". Only two of the 19 countries are on the US government's State Sponsors of Terrorism list - Iran, which has a full ban, and Cuba, which faces partial travel restrictions. But national security is given as a partial reason for the choices. In the proclamation, Trump said many of the countries listed have a ""historic failure to accept back their removable nationals"" from the US, as well as having ""taken advantage"" of the US by exploiting its visa system. He added that nationals from certain countries also ""pose significant risks"" of overstaying their visas. There are a number of people from affected countries who may still be able to enter the US due to a number of exceptions. The order does not apply to:  In addition, the US Secretary of State may grant exemptions to individuals on a ""case-by-case"" basis, if ""the individual would serve a United States national interest"". Trump's latest order, which is expected to face legal challenges, drew a swift response, at home and abroad.  Chad has retaliated by suspending all visas to US citizens, with President Mahamat Idriss Déby Itno saying the country ""has its dignity and pride"". Somalia promised to work with the US to address any security issues, with ambassador to the US, Dahir Hassan Abdi, saying his country ""values its longstanding relationship"" with the US.  Venezuela's Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello warned that ""being in the United States is a great risk for anyone, not just for Venezuelans"". The African Union, which represents all 55 countries on the continent, called on the US to ""engage in constructive dialogue with the countries concerned"".   It appealed to the US to exercise its right to protect its borders and its citizens' security ""in a manner that is balanced, evidence-based, and reflective of the long-standing partnership between the United States and Africa"". The union said it remained concerned about the ""potential negative impact of such measures"". The UN's human rights chief, Volker Turk, said the ban ""raises concerns from the perspective of international law"" ""The broad and sweeping nature of the new travel ban raises concerns from the perspective of international law,"" Volker Turk said in a statement. That included ""the principle of non-discrimination and of the necessity and proportionality of the measures deployed to meet the security concerns stated"", he told news agency AFP. In the US, Democrats were quick to condemn the move. ""This ban, expanded from Trump's Muslim ban in his first term, will only further isolate us on the world stage,"" Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal wrote on social media. Congressman Don Beyer said Trump had ""betrayed"" the ideals of the founders of the US. Human rights organisation Amnesty International USA described it as ""discriminatory, racist, and downright cruel"", while the US-based Human Rights First called it ""yet another anti-immigrant and punitive action taken"" by the president. But others support the ban. Congressman Clay Higgins of Louisiana said travel to the US was ""a privilege, not a right"".  He claimed on BBC Radio's Today programme that Americans had ""had enough of immigrants coming to our country, violating our laws and committing violence among our people"". Greg Swenson, chairman of Republicans Overseas UK, said the list of countries subject to the travel ban proves the White House is using a ""common sense policy"", but expressed suprise that Egypt had not been included. ""I think what the president has decided was that Egypt, despite having one particular incident from an illegal migrant, might have some policies that are in place which are better than other countries,"" he said. Trump's original ban took place in 2017, during his first White House term, and featured some of the same countries as his latest order, including Iran, Libya and Somalia.   Critics called it a ""Muslim ban"" as the seven countries initially listed were Muslim majority, and it was immediately challenged in courts across the US. The White House revised the policy, ultimately adding two non-Muslim majority countries, North Korea and Venezuela. It was upheld by the US Supreme Court in 2018. Joe Biden, who succeeded Trump as US president, repealed the ban in 2021, calling it ""a stain on our national conscience"". US immigration law expert Christi Jackson said the new ban suggested ""lessons have been learned"" from Trump's first attempt. The latest ban was not being implemented immediately, the restrictions were ""wider in scope"" and it had ""clearly defined"" exemptions, she told the BBC. Professor of law and former US attorney Barbara McQuade said the last travel ban had ""caused chaos at the border"", while this time Trump had given some advance notice. ""The first time around it included lawful permanent residents or Green Card holders, people who had established status in the United States, which courts found to be a violation of the Constitution,"" she told BBC Newshour. ""This time I think there has been more thought given to this,"" she said, adding it was ""very likely"" to be upheld by the Supreme Court.

6/5/2025,Article,Women warned weight-loss jabs may affect the pill,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/cn0gp2pl7zwo,"Women using weight-loss jabs have been warned by the UK's medicines regulator that they must use effective contraception. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) says it is not known whether taking the medicines, such as Wegovy and Mounjaro, could harm an unborn baby. It also warns that weight-loss jabs may make the contraceptive pill less likely to work in those who are overweight or obese. There are concerns that the growing popularity of 'skinny jabs' means many women aren't using the drugs safely or getting the right advice. It's thought the contraceptive pill may not be absorbed properly due to common side-effects of the jabs such as vomiting and diarrhoea, and because they slow the emptying of the stomach.  The MHRA says women should use contraception while taking GLP-1 medicines and for a certain period afterwards before trying to become pregnant - two months for Wegovy and Ozempic, and one month for Mounjaro. It also advises that those using Mounjaro and taking an oral contraceptive should also use a condom for four weeks after starting the drug, or switch to another method such as the coil or implant.  Advice on contraception already appears in patient information leaflets that come with the medicines, but the MHRA has now issued its own guidance. The drugs safety body says weight-loss injections must not be taken: Women should be told this information when they starting taking the jabs, but there are fears the message is not getting through. Natasha Major, 26, started using Mounjaro to lose weight before planning to try for her third baby in a few years' time, but was shocked six weeks later to find she was pregnant. She was taking the contraceptive pill at the time. ""I have polycystic ovaries as well, so I can't get pregnant easily or quickly. So it was an even bigger shock that I had, which didn't make any sense to me,"" she says. She then worried she could be harming the baby or it would not develop properly. Natasha rang her GP for advice and was told to stop taking it. ""We're over the initial shock now and really happy, just wasn't expected,"" she says.  ""The last injection I took, I found out about the pregnancy three hours later and haven't taken it since then. ""I've had an early scan to make sure the pregnancy was viable and okay - baby had a little heartbeat and everything looks good,"" Natasha says.  The MHRA, as well as doctors and pharmacists, are worried that popular GLP-1 medicines, known as Wegovy, Mounjaro, Saxenda, Victoza and Ozempic, are not being used safely. These prescription medicines, which are licensed to treat obesity (and Ozempic for type 2 diabetes), make people feel full by mimicking a hormone released after eating. Mounjaro also acts on another hormone linked to appetite and blood sugar control. They are only available on the NHS to people with a very high BMI, but can also be bought privately from high street and online chemists. Such is the demand for the jabs, they are also being sold illegally on social media and from beauty salons, without any medical advice or prescription, as a quick fix to lose weight.  The MHRA advises people to have a conversation with their prescriber about the risks and benefits of taking them, and understand the potential side-effects by talking to a doctor or pharmacist. It has acted now because it has received around 40 reports relating to pregnancy made to its Yellow Card scheme, where the public can report suspected side-effects of medicines. Some of these have been unintended pregnancies. Dr Alison Cave, chief safety officer at the MHRA, said there was evidence from animal studies ""that these medicines may harm the unborn baby"". ""But we don't know whether we have the same effects in humans, so much more data is needed to determine that."" Women of child-bearing age are usually not included in clinical trials, which is why there is a lack of safety information for them. ""If you are taking this medicine and you are pregnant, you should talk to your doctor about stopping the medicine as soon as possible,"" Dr Cave said. Sukhi Basra, vice-chairwoman of the National Pharmacy Association, said women should visit their pharmacist for advice if they are confused about when to stop using the drugs, and always buy them from an official pharmacy. Dr Bassel Wattar, pregnancy expert and consultant at Epsom and St Helier University Hospitals, said the implant or the intrauterine coil offered ""more robust contraception"" than the oral combined contraceptive pill while taking the injections. Losing a lot of weight can sometimes help some women restore natural ovulation and boost their chances of becoming pregnant, but he said this should be planned under the care of specialist doctors ""to ensure a pregnancy can be planned safely after a washout period off these drugs"". BPAS, the British Pregnancy Advisory Service, says women in the UK ""face significant challenges"" when trying to access their contraceptive method of choice. A lack of appointments, long waiting lists and high costs are just some of the barriers they face, BPAS said, as it called for a better plan for providing the choice women need.

6/5/2025,Article,How airline fees have turned baggage into billions,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/c0qg3ylx2g9o,"With Air Canada and Southwest the latest airlines to charge passengers for check-in luggage, the ballooning cost of such ancillary or ""junk fees"" is provoking anger among politicians and consumer groups. At the same time, sales of suitcases small enough for passengers to take on the plane as hand luggage are booming. Standing outside Toronto's downtown airport, Lauren Alexander has flown over from Boston for the weekend. She describes such additional charges as ""ridiculous"". ""It feels like a trick,"" says the 24-year-old. ""You buy the ticket, you think it's going to be less expensive, then you have to pay $200 (£148) extra [to bring a suitcase]."" To avoid the fee, Ms Alexander instead travelled with a small backpack as hand luggage. Sage Riley, who is 27, agrees, telling the BBC, ""It can be pricey."" There was a time when checked bags, seat selection and your meals all came as standard on commercial flights. But that all changed with the rise of the budget airlines, says Jay Sorensen of US aviation consultancy IdeaWorks. It was in 2006 when UK low-cost carrier FlyBe became what is believed to be the world's first airline to start charging passengers to check in bags. It charged £2 for a pre-booked item of luggage, and £4 if the customer hadn't paid in advance.  Other budget carriers then quickly followed suit, with the so-called flag carriers or established airlines then also doing so, at least on shorter flights. In 2008 American Airlines became the first US airline to charge a fee, $15, for the first checked bag on its domestic routes. Mr Sorenson says such traditional airlines felt they had no choice when they ""began to realise that the low-cost carriers were providing very significant competition"". He adds: ""They felt they had to do something to meet that."" Fast forward to today, and US airlines alone made $7.27bn from check-in baggage fees last year, according to federal figures. That is up from $7bn in 2023, and $5.76bn in 2019. Little wonder then that more of us are trying to just take carry-on. Kirsty Glenn, managing director of UK luggage firm Antler, confirms that there is an ongoing surge in demand for small suitcases that meet airline dimension limits for carry-on luggage. ""We have seen huge spikes in searches online and on our website,"" she says. Describing a new small-dimension case her company launched in April, Ms Glenn adds: ""Testament to the trend of only travelling with hand luggage, it's sold like crazy."" At the same time, social media content about travel packing ""hacks"" and luggage that meets airlines' carry-on size measurements, have soared according to travel journalist Chelsea Dickenson. She makes this content for TikTok. ""Social media has really propelled this idea of needing a bag that fits the baggage allowance requirements, says Ms Dickenson. ""It's become a core part of the content that I create and post on social media."" Ms Dickenson, whose social media following has ballooned to close to a million followers, adds that her luggage videos have become a ""core part of the content"" she creates. ""It blows my mind,"" she says. ""I could spend weeks and weeks researching a big trip, and the resulting videos will not come close to doing as well as me going and buying a cheap suitcase, taking it to the airport, testing it in one of those baggage sizes and reporting back."" The overall global cost of all airline extra fees, from luggage to seat selection, buying wifi access, lounge access, upgrades, and food and drink, is expected to reach $145bn this year, 14% of the sector's total revenues. That's according to the International Air Transport Association, which represents the industry. This compares with $137bn last year. These numbers have caught the attention of some politicians in Washington, and last December airline bosses were grilled before a senate committee. It was a Democrat senator who used the term ""junk fees"".   He wants the federal government to review such costs and potentially fine airlines. We asked the US Department of Transportation for a comment, but did not get a response. But if having to pay for check-in wasn't enough, a growing number of airlines are now charging for hand luggage. For example, Irish budget airline Ryanair will only allow you to carry a small bag that fits under the seat in front of you for free. If you want to take a bigger bag or suitcase to go in the overhead locker that will cost you from £6. Other European airlines that now have similar charges for hand luggage are Easyjet, Norwegian Airlines, Transavia, Volotea, Vueling, and Wizzair. This has annoyed pan-European consumer group Becu (The European Consumer Organisation), which last month filed a complaint with the European Commission. Becu cites a 2014 EU Court of Justice ruling, which said ""carriage of hand baggage cannot be made subject to a price supplement, provided that it meets reasonable requirements in terms of its weight and dimensions, and complies with applicable security requirements"". However, what determines ""reasonable requirements"" continues to be a grey area in need of an official ruling. There can, however, be a different way of doing things, as shown by Indian airline IndiGo. Its boss Pieter Eibers says that it does not charge for check-in luggage. ""The entire philosophy here is different,"" he says. ""We don't want long lines, and endless debates at gates about the weight of luggage. We don't have any of that. We turn our planes around in 35 minutes."" Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.  The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites. Read about our approach to external linking.  "
6/5/2025,Article,'I slowly realised I was running two households',https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/c5y4zzwr943o,"As retirement age rises for many people, more grown-up children than ever are providing their parents with the support they need to go on living independently, while also continuing to work full time themselves. Christine Bell is one of these so-called ""carents"". Christine is preparing to take her 95-year-old father Colin to a routine hospital appointment. But, for Christine, who lives in Guiseley, Leeds, that means a 400-mile round trip and two days away from running her own business as her father lives in London. It is a train journey she has made many times in the last 15 years.  Her late mum, Beryl, once broke her knee in a fall and, in order for her to stay at home, Christine and her sister decided to divide up her care between them. ""Slowly, I realised I was running two households,"" Christine says. ""I was doing all their bills; I had more contact with their GP than mine."" As Beryl's health deteriorated and Christine tried to manage her mother's palliative care long-distance alongside managing her own life, she says she eventually reached breaking point. Becoming emotional, Christine explains: ""There were times I just wanted my mum to die because she was suffering."" Having packed for her latest trip to the South, Christine takes one train into Leeds city centre and then another one to London, before finally getting the tube to her father's house.  By the time she returns to Leeds, she will have been travelling for more than nine hours, all so she can accompany her father to a 10-minute appointment at a nearby pacemaker clinic. Christine says she has been lucky to have a ""really loving"" relationship with her parents, but at times she has found it overwhelming trying to support them to stay at home alongside continuing her own work. According to Dr Jackie Gray, Christine is far from alone. Dr Gray, a retired GP and public health consultant based in Northumberland, says she has watched the role adult children play in ageing parents' lives change ""dramatically"" over the course of her career.  She explains that when she first qualified, it was rare to see people living past 75. ""But, medical advancements, people living and working longer, as well as living further away from their parents, has caused a kind of perfect storm - a societal shift,"" she says. In 2020, after seeing increasing numbers of patients - usually women, she says - struggle with caring for their parents, Dr Gray launched the Carents Room website, offering forums and information. Dr Gray says ""nobody really knows"" how many ""carents"" there are, but a 2023 King's Fund report suggested that about 57% of unpaid carers were looking after a parent or grandparent. That means there could be up to four million people in this position in England alone, she says. A recent Carents Room survey of at least 1,000 members found more than half provided about 20 hours of care a week.  Meanwhile, 70% said they had reduced their working hours or left work altogether so they could care for their relatives. According to Dr Gray, family relationships can be complex and older people can find the idea of their children as carers upsetting - as can the grown-up children themselves. Relationships with siblings can also be fraught, she says. Plus, Dr Gray points out that ""carents"" can often struggle with what she calls a sense of ""anticipatory grief"". All of this means the support group she set up has seen a rise in people seeking help. ""We have a signed-up community of about 40,000 people, and that is growing by almost 100 people a day,"" she says. Common themes, including struggling with ""life admin"", appointments, travel, and balancing work commitments all emerge from the online forums and focus groups, Dr Gray explains. According to the Office of National Statistics (ONS), there were an estimated 1.4 million so-called ""sandwich"" carers - people who provide care for sick, disabled, or older adult relatives as well as for dependent children - in the UK between 2021 and 2023. The ONS found that 61% of ""sandwich"" carers were female. It also found that in England, the North East had the highest proportion of unpaid carers, at 10.1%, compared to other regions, as well as the highest proportion of people providing 50 or more hours of care. Meanwhile, according to figures compiled by Carers UK, in England and Wales, unpaid carers provided care worth £183bn in 2021-22 - an increase of £64.9bn since 2011. Dr Gray says that each family affected in this way has its own set of circumstances and, crucially, each family member has their own feelings about the situation. But, as the population lives longer and with more health needs, and with women also now expected to work for longer, the state's reliance on families to protect an already creaking social care system increases. Dr Gray says recognition and support are key. ""It can be hard for an adult child to accept they are a carer,"" she says. ""But once you've got that recognition in place and people feel heard, I think we're looking at really practical solutions,"" she says. Dr Gray explains that ""coordinating healthcare"" and ""opportunities for respite care"" could help people like Christine who care for elderly relatives.   She adds that she believes ""some sort of commissioner, a commissioner for frailty, perhaps"" should be introduced by the government.  Those taking part in Dr Gray's focus groups say more flexibility in appointment systems, as well as ""carental"" leave and tax breaks, might also help. A spokesperson for the government said it recognised ""the immense contribution of carers who selflessly dedicate their time to supporting others, and want families to receive the support they deserve.  ""We have increased the Carer's Allowance earnings threshold by around an additional £2,000 a year – the biggest rise since it was introduced in 1976. ""We have also launched an independent review into social care, which will include exploring the needs of unpaid carers who provide vital care and support."" Back in Leeds after her 400-mile round trip taking her father to his appointment, Christine Bell says at times she found it hard to think of herself as carer to her parents. ""I am, because without me, their house wouldn't have run, they wouldn't have had the care that they need,"" she says. ""But I want to be a daughter, first and foremost.""

6/5/2025,Article,Supreme Court rejects Mexico lawsuit against US gunmakers ,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/c1dez6rwz07o,"The US Supreme Court has blocked a lawsuit brought by Mexico that sought to hold American gunmakers accountable for playing a role in country's struggle with drug cartels. The court voted 9-0 to reject the suit, in the process upholding a 2005 law that shields gun manufacturers from liability if weapons they produce are misused. Mexico's government had argued that the ""flood"" of illegal guns across the border is a result of ""deliberate"" practices by US firms that they say appealed to cartel members with their products.  The decision overturns a lower court's ruling that allowed the suit, brought against manufacturer Smith & Wesson and wholesaler Interstate Arms, to proceed. Mexico's original lawsuit was filed in 2021 against eight gun manufacturers, but the cases against six of them were dismissed by a district court.  The Supreme Court has now rejected the suit in its entirety, agreeing the case satisfied an exception to the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA), which limits the liability of gun manufactures.  In its complaint, the Mexican government argued that the gun manufacturers ""supply firearms to retail dealers whom they know illegally sell to Mexican gun traffickers"". It also claimed that the manufacturers did not impose any controls on their distribution networks to prevent the sale of these weapons to traffickers in Mexico.  The Supreme Court said Mexico's complaint ""does not plausibly allege that the defendant manufacturers aided and abetted gun dealers' unlawful sales of firearms to Mexican traffickers"". The court said it has ""little doubt"" some guns are sold to Mexican firearm traffickers. However, it added that the government had been unable to prove that the manufacturers ""participate in"" those sales, as its complaint did not identify any specific criminal transactions.  Mexico's accusation was more general, the court said - that the manufacturers help a number of unidentified ""rogue gun dealers"" sell firearms illegally. This case is the first time the court has taken up the PLCAA shield law, which limits the ability of victims of gun violence to sue firearms manufacturers and dealers for the misuse of their products.  At a hearing in March, the court appeared sceptical of Mexico's challenge, with justices on both sides of the ideological spectrum questioning the validity of the suit.  An investigation by the BBC's US partner CBS News revealed that between 200,000 and 500,000 US-made firearms are trafficked to Mexico each year.  Almost half the guns recovered at crime scenes in Mexico are manufactured in the US, CBS reported citing data from the US' Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Copyright 2025 BBC.

6/5/2025,Article,First bacteria we ever meet can keep us out of hospital,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/cgr5lej9l8lo,"The first bacteria our bodies meet – in the hours after we're born – could protect us from dangerous infections, UK scientists say. They have shown, for the first time, that good bacteria seem to halve the risk of young children being admitted to hospital with lung infections. The researchers said it was a ""phenomenal"" finding and could lead to therapies that boost good bacteria in babies. Our early encounters with microbes are thought to be crucial in how our immune system develops. We come out of the womb sterile, but this doesn't last for long. All the nooks and crannies of the human body become home to a world of microbial life, known as the microbiome. Researchers at University College London and the Sanger Institute investigated the earliest stages in our body's colonisation by bacteria, fungi and more. They collected stool samples from 1,082 newborns in the first week of life. The team then performed a massive genetic analysis on all the DNA in the samples to work out exactly which species were present and how common they were in each child. They then tracked what happened to those babies, using hospital data, for the next two years. One particular early inhabitant of the human body, Bifidobacterium longum, seemed to have a protective effect. Only 4% of babies with this species would spend a night in hospital with a lung infection over the next two years. Babies with different starter-bacteria were two-to-three times more likely to need to stay in hospital. It is the first data to show the formation of the microbiome affects the risk of infection. ""I think it's really phenomenal. It's amazing to be able to show this. I'm excited,"" Prof Nigel Field, from UCL, told the BBC.  The most likely culprit for children ending up in hospital is respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), but what joins the dots between this and B. longum? That is the ""million dollar question"" for Prof Field. We know B. longum starts off digesting breast milk which both contains food for the baby and encourages good bacteria.  The exact details have not yet been worked out, but either the bacteria themselves or the compounds they make by digesting food are interacting with the immune system ""and are influencing the way in which the immune system matures and is able to recognise friend from foe,"" according to Prof Field. The protective bacteria were found only in babies that came into the world via a vaginal delivery rather than a caesarean. Even then they were not discovered after every vaginal delivery. The researchers say their findings do not justify the practice of vaginal seeding,  where some new parents smear babies with a swab taken from the vagina. The good bacteria seem to be coming from the end of the mother's digestive system, an idea known in the field as the ""first lick"". ""I feel pretty confident in saying that vaginal seeding is not a good thing,"" said Prof Field. However, the long-term ambition is to come up with microbial therapies – like a probiotic yogurt – that could be given to babies to set their microbiomes on a healthy path. Prof Louise Kenny, from the University of Liverpool and a consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist, said: ""A caesarean section is often a life-saving procedure, and can be the right choice for a woman and her baby."" She said that while the benefit was seen only in babies born vaginally, it was not in every child born that way so ""further research is needed to create a full, nuanced picture"".

6/5/2025,Article,Stores open at midnight as fans rush to buy Nintendo Switch 2,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/ckgxwe774zwo,"The Nintendo Switch 2 has been released worldwide, with stores opening at midnight so fans could get their hands on the long-awaited console the moment it became available. Some shops have the devices available to buy off the shelf - but in most cases customers have been picking up consoles they had ordered in advance, with UK retailer Currys calling it its ""biggest gaming pre-order ever."" Despite the excitement there have been some setbacks, with one supplier, Game, cancelling some pre-orders.  In the US, Nintendo briefly pulled Switch 2 pre-orders in April over concerns around tariffs before starting again a few weeks later. But that doesn't appear to have put fans off- with queues forming at stores around the world as gamers vied to be among the first to unbox their new console. Currys told the BBC it had sold 30,000 units - which it attributed to the ""incredible excitement"" associated with the launch. Despite the initial excitement, questions remain over whether the Switch 2 will match the success of its predecessor - the third-best selling console in history - in part because of its high game prices. A physical copy of its most high-profile game, Mario Kart World, comes in at £74.99 - £15 more expensive than a typical Switch title. The original Nintendo Switch has shifted more than 150 million units since its 2017 release. A successor has been in the works for years - so perhaps unsurprisingly Tushar Sandarka, the President of the University of York's Mario Kart society, is among those excited about the launch, and the new version of Mario coming with it. ""It's coming out with Mario Kart World - which is the first since 2014 - it's a big deal for us,"" the 19-year-old said. ""Securing a pre-order was such a tough decision because it's so expensive.  ""Even if it's a bit higher than I would have wanted to pay for it, it's going to serve me well for the next 7 or 8 years."" But not everyone the BBC spoke to said they would be picking up the console on launch. Mae and Lottie, both students in York, said they would stick to the original Switch because of the cost. ""It's quite spenny,"" Mae said. ""What we've got is fine."" Lottie agreed, but said she was disappointed not to play on the new Mario Kart game - which she said could cost her as much as ""a day's pay"".  ""I'm not spending that on a game,"" she said. For Nintendo, the Switch 2 represents a change in strategy - in the past its new devices have been given an entirely new name. ""This is the first time Nintendo has ever launched a straight sequel,"" GamesRadar+ brand director Sam Loveridge told the BBC.  ""It's a clear proposition for consumers - they know exactly what they're getting from this console if they are familiar with the original Switch."" She said ""everything is pointing to"" pre-orders having sold well.  ""When pre-orders first went live, it was an absolute scramble to find any stock, but Nintendo was clearly prepared and since those early weeks, it's been a lot easier to secure yourself a console for launch day,"" she said. I was one of the lucky few to get my hands on the Switch 2 at an event in April. Like its predecessor, it is a ""hybrid"" console - a handheld device which can also be plugged into a TV to play on the big screen. But it has a bigger and brighter screen, along with lots more power and storage. It still has a bit of innovation - you can use the controller like a computer mouse by twisting it on its side, making PC games such as Civilization VII a more enjoyable experience than using joysticks. But many of the showcase Nintendo games on display at that event  - including Metroid Prime 4, Donkey Kong: Bananza, and Super Mario Party Jamboree TV - won't be available at launch. Instead the only new Nintendo game on the new console will be Mario Kart World, barring a small title called Welcome Tour which showcases some of the new hardware. ""It might seem like an odd bet, but with the original Mario Kart 8 being the best-selling Wii U game and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe being the best-selling Nintendo Switch game, there's a very established audience there,"" Ms Loveridge said. The gaming giant is also releasing on day one upgraded versions of the Switch's Legend of Zelda games, Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom, which take advantage of the console's greater power. Beyond that, gamers will have to look to third-party games for alternatives on launch. The range of games includes Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma, Cyberpunk 2077, and Bravely Default. ""This more powerful console offers plenty of opportunities for third-party games publishers bringing Nintendo into more direct competition with Sony and Microsoft,"" said Katie Holt, senior games industry research analyst at Ampere Analysis . And fans can expect more from third-party games as the console develops too - with Nintendo senior director Takuhiro Dohta telling me he expected games to get even better. ""When there are software titles set for the launch of the hardware, the developers still don't fully know the capabilities and hardware well enough,"" he said.  ""As developers continue to develop, they start to understand how it works and what it's capable of, so I think we can expect improvements not only in graphics but in gameplay too.""

6/5/2025,Article,Rare oil portrait of Mahatma Gandhi to be auctioned in London,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/cp3nl6gq7vlo,"A rare oil portrait of Indian independence leader Mahatma Gandhi - painted in 1931 in the UK - will be auctioned in London next month. Gandhi led a non-violent resistance movement against British rule in India and his teachings have inspired millions. Most Indians revere him as the ""father of the nation"". Over the years, several paintings, drawings and sketches of him have circulated around the world.  The auction house Bonhams says the painting, made by British artist Clare Leighton, is ""thought to be the only oil portrait that Gandhi actually sat for"". The portrait was made when Gandhi went to London in 1931 for the second Round Table conference, held to discuss constitutional reforms for India and address its demands for self-governance.  It will be auctioned in the second week of July at Bonhams.  ""This is a painting of unique historic and cultural significance. It would be great if it could be seen and appreciated more widely, whether in India or elsewhere,"" Caspar Leighton, a great nephew of the artist, told the BBC. According to Bonhams, Clare Leighton ""was one of the very few artists admitted to his office and was given the opportunity to sit with on multiple occasions to sketch and paint his likeness"". The works remained in the artist's collection until her death in 1989 in the US, after which it was passed down through her family. She was introduced to Gandhi through her partner and British political journalist, Henry Noel Brailsford, who was a strong supporter of India's independence movement. In November 1931, Leighton showcased her portraits of Gandhi at an exhibition at the Albany Galleries in London.  Though Gandhi did not attend the opening event, several representatives from the Indian delegation of the second Round Table were present.  Among them was Sarojini Naidu, also an eminent Indian independence leader, who was one of the key advisors to Gandhi at the meeting.  The exhibition included a charcoal sketch of Gandhi, asleep in his office, along with the oil portrait that is now set to be auctioned.  About the painting of Gandhi, British Journalist Winifred Holtby wrote: ""The little man squats bare-headed, in his blanket, one finger raised, as it often is to emphasise a point, his mouth parted for a word that is almost a smile"". The following month, Gandhi's personal secretary Mahadev Desai wrote to Leighton, saying, ""many of my friends who saw it [the oil portrait] in the Albany Gallery said to me that it was a good likeness"". There doesn't seem to be any public record of the oil portrait being displayed elsewhere until 1978, when the Boston Public Library organised an exhibition of Leighton's works. However, according to the artist's family, the portrait was thought to have been on display in the 1970s in the US, where it was allegedly damaged in a knife attack.  A label attached to the backing board of the portrait says it was restored by the Lyman Allyn Museum Conservation Laboratory in Connecticut in 1974. The details of the alleged attack are not clear - according to Bonhams, it was carried out by a right-wing Hindu activist.  Hindu hardliners in India accuse Gandhi of having betrayed Hindus by being too pro-Muslim, and blame him for the division of India and the bloodshed that marked Partition, which saw India and Pakistan created after independence in 1947. He was shot dead on 30 January 1948 at a prayer meeting by Nathuram Godse, an activist with nationalist right-wing groups. Copyright 2025 BBC.

6/5/2025,Article,First bacteria we ever meet can keep us out of hospital,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/cgr5lej9l8lo,"The first bacteria our bodies meet – in the hours after we're born – could protect us from dangerous infections, UK scientists say. They have shown, for the first time, that good bacteria seem to halve the risk of young children being admitted to hospital with lung infections. The researchers said it was a ""phenomenal"" finding and could lead to therapies that boost good bacteria in babies. Our early encounters with microbes are thought to be crucial in how our immune system develops. We come out of the womb sterile, but this doesn't last for long. All the nooks and crannies of the human body become home to a world of microbial life, known as the microbiome. Researchers at University College London and the Sanger Institute investigated the earliest stages in our body's colonisation by bacteria, fungi and more. They collected stool samples from 1,082 newborns in the first week of life. The team then performed a massive genetic analysis on all the DNA in the samples to work out exactly which species were present and how common they were in each child. They then tracked what happened to those babies, using hospital data, for the next two years. One particular early inhabitant of the human body, Bifidobacterium longum, seemed to have a protective effect. Only 4% of babies with this species would spend a night in hospital with a lung infection over the next two years. Babies with different starter-bacteria were two-to-three times more likely to need to stay in hospital. It is the first data to show the formation of the microbiome affects the risk of infection. ""I think it's really phenomenal. It's amazing to be able to show this. I'm excited,"" Prof Nigel Field, from UCL, told the BBC.  The most likely culprit for children ending up in hospital is respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), but what joins the dots between this and B. longum? That is the ""million dollar question"" for Prof Field. We know B. longum starts off digesting breast milk which both contains food for the baby and encourages good bacteria.  The exact details have not yet been worked out, but either the bacteria themselves or the compounds they make by digesting food are interacting with the immune system ""and are influencing the way in which the immune system matures and is able to recognise friend from foe,"" according to Prof Field. The protective bacteria were found only in babies that came into the world via a vaginal delivery rather than a caesarean. Even then they were not discovered after every vaginal delivery. The researchers say their findings do not justify the practice of vaginal seeding,  where some new parents smear babies with a swab taken from the vagina. The good bacteria seem to be coming from the end of the mother's digestive system, an idea known in the field as the ""first lick"". ""I feel pretty confident in saying that vaginal seeding is not a good thing,"" said Prof Field. However, the long-term ambition is to come up with microbial therapies – like a probiotic yogurt – that could be given to babies to set their microbiomes on a healthy path. Prof Louise Kenny, from the University of Liverpool and a consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist, said: ""A caesarean section is often a life-saving procedure, and can be the right choice for a woman and her baby."" She said that while the benefit was seen only in babies born vaginally, it was not in every child born that way so ""further research is needed to create a full, nuanced picture"".

6/6/2025,Article,Russia launches 'massive' strikes days after Ukrainian drone attack,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/cvg7zy1jq7no,"Russia launched large-scale drone and missile strikes on Ukraine's capital and other parts of the country early on Friday, officials said.  At least three people were killed and 49 injured in the strikes, according to Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky. The aerial raids targeted Kyiv, as well as the city of Lutsk and the Ternopil region in the north-west of the country. Russia's defence ministry said the strikes were in response to ""terrorist acts by the Kyiv regime"", adding that it had targeted military sites. The ministry said its armed forces ""overnight launched a massive strike with high-precision long-range air, sea and ground-based weapons, as well as attack drones"". The attack came after Russian President Vladimir Putin warned US President Donald Trump he would respond to Ukraine's recent strikes on Russian airbases.  In a post on X on Friday, Zelensky said that ""now is exactly the moment when America, Europe, and everyone around the world can stop this war together by pressuring Russia"". He made a thinly veiled reference to Trump's apparent unwillingness to put pressure on Russia. ""If someone is not applying pressure and is giving the war more time to take lives – that is complicity and accountability,"" Zelensky wrote. ""We must act decisively."" Zelensky said that ""as of now"", three deaths had been confirmed in the strikes - all employees of Ukraine's state emergency services. He said the attack used more than 400 drones and more than 40 missiles, and the number of people injured ""may increase"". In an earlier statement, Kyiv's Mayor Vitali Klitschko said four people had been killed in the country's capital. Air raid alerts were in place in Kyiv, where a residential building was hit, and the city's train system was disrupted after shelling damaged metro tracks. Tens of thousands of civilians in the capital spent a restless few hours in underground shelters. From the centre of the city, prolonged bursts of machine gun fire could be heard as air defences on the outskirts attempted to bring down scores of drones aimed at Kyiv.  From time to time, the distinctive buzz of drones overhead could also be heard. Bright flashes of light, sometimes reflected on nearby buildings, would be followed, five or ten seconds later, by thunderous explosions. Authorities say the attacks included 38 cruise missiles, which is the kind Ukraine targeted in Sunday's so-called ""Spider's Web"" operation, suggesting this attack could be a message from the Kremlin. The cities of Kharkiv, Sumy and Luhansk were also under air raid alerts. Elsewhere, Ternopil's military chief Vyacheslav Negoda said Friday's strike was the ""most massive air attack on our region to date"". Mayor of Ternopil, Igor Polishchuk, said five people were wounded in the attack and there was damage to homes, schools and a government facility. In Lutsk, five people were injured in an attack using 15 drones and six missiles, according to mayor Ihor Polishchuk.  Meanwhile, the Russian defence ministry said its air defences shot down 174 Ukrainian drones overnight in parts of Russia and occupied Crimea.  The ministry said Neptune anti-ship cruise missiles were also intercepted over the Black Sea.  Russia's latest attack on Ukraine comes days after Kyiv launched its biggest long-range drone strike on at least 40 Russian warplanes at four military bases. Zelensky said 117 drones were used in the Spider's Web operation by the SBU security service, striking ""34% of [Russia's] strategic cruise missile carriers"". Earlier this month, direct peace talks between Russia and Ukraine took place in Istanbul, but ended without a major breakthrough.  Ukrainian negotiators said Russia rejected an ""unconditional ceasefire"" - a key demand of Kyiv and its Western allies including the US. The Russian team said they had proposed a two-or three-day truce ""in certain areas"" of the vast front line, but gave no further details. Trump said Putin vowed to ""very strongly"" respond to Ukraine's recent attack on Russian airbases, during a phone call that lasted more than an hour on Wednesday.  Moscow had previously said that military options were ""on the table"" for its response to Ukraine's attack. Last week, Trump appeared to set a two-week deadline for Putin, threatening to change how the US is responding to Russia if he believed Putin was still ""tapping"" him along on peace efforts in Ukraine.

6/6/2025,Article,How bitter feud escalated - and what happens next,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/c3wd2215q08o,"What happens when the richest person and the most powerful politician have a knock-down, drag-out fight? The world is finding out – and it's not a pretty picture. Donald Trump and Elon Musk have two of the biggest megaphones, and they have now turned them on each other, as a disagreement has ballooned into a war of words. Trump has threatened Musk's voluminous business dealings with the federal government, which form the lifeblood of his SpaceX programme. ""The easiest way to save money in our budget, billions and billions of dollars, is to terminate Elon's governmental subsidies and contracts,"" Trump posted menacingly on his own social media website. If Trump turns the machinery of government against Musk, the tech billionaire will feel pain. Tesla's stock price plunged by 14% on Thursday. It's not a one-way street, however. After that volley, Musk called for Trump's impeachment and dared him to cut funding for his companies.  Musk also said he was accelerating the decommissioning of his Dragon spacecraft, which the US relies on to carry American astronauts and supplies to the International Space Station.  But hours later, he appeared to back down from that threat, saying in response to a post on X urging him to cool off: ""Good advice. Ok, we won't decommission Dragon."" Musk has near limitless resources to respond, including by funding insurgent challengers to Republicans in next year's elections and primaries. And late on Thursday afternoon, he said he was dropping the ""really big bomb"" – suggesting without evidence that Trump appears in unreleased files related to late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.  His press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, offered only a tepid pushback to Musk's allegations and accusations. ""This is an unfortunate episode from Elon, who is unhappy with the One Big Beautiful Bill because it does not include the policies he wanted,"" she said.  Musk may not win a fight against the whole of Trump's government, but he could exact a high political - and personal - price for Trump and the Republicans. Trump, perhaps aware of this, appeared to tamp down the heat a bit by the end of the day. He avoided commenting on Musk during a public appearance at a White House event and posted a message on Truth Social that said he didn't mind ""turning against him"", but wishes he had quit government service months ago.  He then pivoted to boosting of his ""big, beautiful"" tax and spending legislation. It's difficult to envision an easy walk-down after Thursday's heat, however. The feud started at a simmer last week, began bubbling on Wednesday and became a full-on boil on Thursday afternoon in the Oval Office. As new German Chancellor Friedrich Merz – the day's visitor – sat in awkward silence, the president sounded a bit like a spurned lover. He expressed surprise at Musk's criticism of his legislation. He pushed back against the notion that he would have lost last year's presidential election without Musk's hundreds of millions of dollars in support. And he said Musk was only changing his tune now because his car company, Tesla, will be hurt by the Republican push to end electric vehicle tax credits. Musk quickly took to his social media site, X, with a very Generation X response for his 220 million followers: ""Whatever"".  He said he didn't care about the car subsidies, and that he wanted to shrink the national debt, which he says is an existential threat to the nation. He insisted that Democrats would have prevailed in last year's election without his help. ""Such ingratitude,"" he told Trump. The billionaire then launched a series of extraordinary attacks throughout the afternoon, and the feud was on in earnest. Musk and Trump had formed a powerful but unlikely alliance, culminating in the tech billionaire having a key position of budget-slashing authority in the Trump administration. Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, or Doge, became one of the biggest stories of Trump's first 100 days, as it shuttered entire agencies and dismissed thousands of government workers. It wasn't long, however, before speculation began over when – and how - the two outsized personalities would ultimately fall out. For a while, it seemed like those predictions were off the mark. Trump stood by Musk even as the latter's popularity dropped, as he feuded with administration officials and as he became a liability in several key elections earlier this year.  Every time it appeared there would be a break, Musk would pop up in the Oval Office, or the Cabinet room or on the president's Air Force One flight to Mar-a-Lago. When Musk's 130 days as a ""special government employee"" ended last week, the two had a chummy Oval Office send-off, with a golden key to the White House and hints that Musk might someday return. It's safe to say that any invitation has been rescinded and the locks have been changed. ""Elon and I had a great relationship,"" Trump said on Thursday – a comment notable for its use of the past tense. There had been some thought that Trump's surprise announcement on Wednesday night of a new travel ban, additional sanctions on Harvard and a conspiracy-laced administration investigation of former President Joe Biden were all efforts to change the subject from Musk's criticism. The White House and its allies in Congress seemed careful not to further antagonise him after his earlier comments. Then Trump spoke out and… so much for that. Now the question is where the dispute goes next. Congressional Republicans could find it harder to keep their members behind Trump's bill with Musk providing rhetorical and, perhaps financial, air cover for those who break ranks. Trump has already threatened Musk's government contracts, but he could also take aim at his remaining Doge allies in the administration or reopen Biden-era investigations into Musk's business dealings. Everything at this point is on the table. Meanwhile, Democrats are on the sidelines, wondering how to respond. Few seem willing to welcome Musk, a former donor to their party, back into the fold. But there's also the old adage that the enemy of an enemy is a friend. ""It's a zero-sum game,"" Liam Kerr, a Democratic strategist, told Politico. ""Anything that he does that moves more toward Democrats hurts Republicans."" At the very least, Democrats seem happy to stand back and let the two men exchange blows. And until they abandon this fight, the din is likely to drown out everything else in American politics. But don't expect this spat to end anytime soon. ""Trump has 3.5 years left as president,"" Musk wrote on X, ""but I will be around for 40-plus years.""

6/6/2025,Article,Australian mushroom lunch cook tells trial meal was 'special',https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/c5y8e1l55kko,"An Australian woman accused of intentionally cooking a fatal mushroom lunch has told her trial she had wanted the beef Wellington meal to be ""special"". Erin Patterson has pleaded not guilty to murdering three people and attempting to kill another at her home in regional Victoria in July 2023.  The 50-year-old says it was a tragic accident, and that she never intended to hurt family members she loved. But prosecutors argue Ms Patterson put poisonous fungi into their food in a carefully crafted plot to kill them. On Friday, the court heard it was ""unusual"" for Ms Patterson to host such an event at her house, and she was quizzed about her relationships with her guests. Ms Patterson's in-laws, Don and Gail Patterson, both 70, along with Gail's sister Heather Wilkinson, 66, all fell ill and died days after the lunch. Heather's husband, local pastor Ian Wilkinson, was also hospitalised but recovered after coming out of a weeks-long induced coma. Simon Patterson, the accused's estranged spouse, had been invited too, but pulled out the day before. More than 50 prosecution witnesses have given evidence at the trial, which began six weeks ago, but Ms Patterson became the first for the defence when she took to the stand on Monday. On her second day of cross-examination on Friday, Ms Patterson told the court she accepted that invites to her house were rare, but said she'd arranged the occasion to discuss a health issue and wanted to make a nice meal for her relatives to thank them for their support. ""I wanted it to be special,"" Ms Patterson said. She has previously admitted she misled her guests into believing she may need cancer treatment, telling the jury she did so as a cover for weight-loss surgery she was planning to have but was too embarrassed to disclose. Prosecutor Nanette Rogers, however, put to her that there was no health issue to discuss, and that she had invited Simon and his relatives over to kill them. She had even prepared a spare toxic meal in case Mr Patterson changed his mind and came over, Dr Rogers suggested. Over and over this week, Ms Patterson has denied these allegations, often becoming emotional as she told the court she loved the lunch guests like her own family. She has also repeatedly told the court that she realised, in the days after the lunch, that the beef Wellington may have accidentally included dried mushrooms she had foraged, which were kept in a container with store-bought ones.  Lies to the police and health authorities about the source of the mushrooms and her decision to dispose of a food dehydrator were both because she was scared of being blamed for the guests' dire illnesses, she said. ""Surely if you had loved them, then you would have immediately notified the medical authorities?"" Dr Rogers asked. Ms Patterson said she didn't tell doctors about the possibility that wild mushrooms had been unintentionally included because the lunch guests were already getting treatment for death cap mushroom poisoning. ""Even after you were discharged from hospital you did not tell a single person that there may have been foraged mushroom used in the meal,"" Dr Rogers said. ""Instead you got up, you drove your children to school... and drove home. And then you got rid of the dehydrator."" ""Correct,"" Ms Patterson said. The court heard there'd been conflict between Ms Patterson and her husband, and Dr Rogers suggested the accused was still angry at her in-laws for taking their son's side. ""You had two faces,"" Dr Rogers said, after making Ms Patterson read aloud messages in which she is critical of both Simon Patterson and his parents. There was her ""public face"" of appearing to have a good relationship with Don and Gail, Dr Rogers said, and a ""private face"" which she showed in the messages. ""How you truly felt about Don and Gail was how you expressed it [there],"" she said. ""And that is how you really felt about Simon Patterson... you did not regard him as being a decent human being at his core, correct or incorrect?"" That was ""incorrect"", Ms Patterson replied, her head shaking and voice faltering. Ms Patterson's use of the iNaturalist website - which listed locations of death cap mushrooms in areas close to her home - was also scrutinised, with the accused repeatedly saying she couldn't clearly recall ever using the site. She will resume being cross examined next week. The trial, initially expected to take six weeks, is now expected to run for at least another fortnight, the judge has told the court.

6/6/2025,Article,'Underwater needle in a haystack' - how a diver found a 140-year-old shipwreck,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/czel8y3dxp5o,"The mystery of a maritime disaster has been solved after experts found a vessel that sank almost 140 years ago. Diver and explorer Dom Robinson identified the SS Nantes, off Plymouth, after examining the wreck site and finding crockery. Dr Harry Bennett, an expert in maritime history, said the dive team had found ""the underwater archaeological equivalent of a needle in a haystack"". Mr Robinson said solving the mystery ensured those who died were not forgotten. In November 1888, the SS Nantes, which was operated by the Cunard Steamship Company, collided with a German sailing vessel, the Theodor Ruger, said Dr Bennett. The crew spent ""several hours"" trying to save their ship, the honorary associate professor in history at the University of Plymouth said. ""They used mattresses to plug the gap which had opened up in the hull of the SS Nantes,"" he said. ""[The ship sank] with the loss of a substantial number of the crew. There were some 23-odd fatalities. There were three survivors."" Bodies from the wreckage washed ashore at Talland Bay and Looe, in Cornwall, and ""locals were confronted by this picture of horror, pieces of ship together with bodies,"" he said. Afterwards the ""wreck was essentially lost, obviously you're dealing in a period with no satellite navigation,"" said Dr Bennett. He added while the crew tried to save the ship it ""drifted for several hours, before it finally made its way to the bottom, sadly, with many of its crewmen on board"". He said the wreck was lost until a local dive team identified it in 2024. Mr Robinson, who has been diving for about 35 years, said he heard about the unidentified wreck from the UK Hydrographic Office. He said the wreck ""was clearly an early steamship when we got down there"" but ""at the end of my dive I found a broken piece of plate... I decided to bring it up to the surface [and] we found that had the Cunard Steamship crest on it"". ""It was then bingo, we've found it,"" he said.  Dr Bennett said it was identified by the build and dimensions of the wreck, the technology on board, the cargo and ""lastly and most telling, they find a plate on the back of which is stamped Cunard - this is a Cunard ship"". ""[It was] very methodical, very, very dedicated detective work,"" he said. Mr Robinson said: ""This was an awful tragedy. One of the things I like to think is by solving mysteries and telling those stories I'm ensuring that those people aren't forgotten."" Since the initial find, Mr Robinson said he had dived the wreck again and found a second piece of Cunard crockery, providing ""even more confirmation"". ""There are very few mysteries left to explore in this world,"" he said. ""As a normal human being like me, going in exploring shipwrecks and identifying shipwrecks, that is just something different to my normal life, and it's a fantastic feeling."" Dr Bennett said ""all the pieces fit and I think the local dive team are to be congratulated on a splendid piece of detective work which reveals this maritime disaster"".  He said he had looked at the footage and methodology and had confirmed they were right ""beyond any reasonable shadow of a doubt, this is the SS Nantes"".

6/6/2025,Article,Olly Alexander: I've come into a different space in my life,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/c4g3ele74l3o,"Singer and actor Olly Alexander has said he has ""come into a different space in my life"", as he announced a new West End stage role after recently parting ways with his record label. The star will appear in the National Theatre's production of The Importance of Being Earnest when it transfers to the West End in September. It will be his first acting role since It's A Sin, Channel 4's acclaimed 2021 drama about the Aids crisis, for which he was nominated for a Bafta Award. ""I'd recently been thinking that I'd love to act again,"" Alexander told BBC News. ""I'd come to the end of my record contract, and I have a bit more breathing space to try a few different things and not feel, oh, well I have to deliver an album to my record label."" He will take over from Doctor Who star Ncuti Gatwa, who starred in The Importance of Being Earnest when it opened at the National Theatre in 2024.  Alexander will play Algernon when the show moves to the Noel Coward Theatre in London, in collaboration with Sonia Friedman Productions.  ""What's not to love?"" he asked. ""It's such a brilliant play, Oscar Wilde's most celebrated comedy. I saw the National production and thought it was fantastic, and this opportunity came along and I jumped at the chance."" Alexander shot to fame when his band Years & Years won the BBC Sound of 2015 poll and went on to have hits such as King and Shine, and score a number one album. He later went solo, although continued to perform as Years & Years, and scored another top-charting album in 2021. He has performed with Sir Elton John and Kylie Minogue, and was the UK's Eurovision entrant last year. However, after his most recent album Polari, released in February, reached number 17, Alexander announced his departure from his record label. ""They aren't dropping me, they just aren't renewing my contract,"" he explained at the time. ""It's OK and honestly for the best. I've been on a pretty terrible deal for 10 years. It's time I do something new. But I'll still make music in the future."" Reflecting on his first decade as a pop star, Alexander told the BBC: ""With music, there's an intensity to the way I've been working and putting albums out, promoting and touring. I definitely want to take the foot off the gas in terms of that intensity.""  He still occasionally works on music, but has ""not been putting pressure on myself... I just do what feels good and feel very lucky that I have this other strand of acting that I'm able to explore"". Alexander said he felt he had ""learned so much"" over the last decade about the way he likes to work.  ""But for me,"" he continued, ""a lot of the reason I think the [music] industry has changed so much is that it's set on this model which is very antiquated now, and it's not kept pace with the times.  ""Lots of artists have this direct link with their audience via social media. They want their music out quickly. The whole model of promoting it - three singles into an album, then you tour the album, then move onto the next one - it's not really working like it did."" He noted that record labels could historically make an album a success because they were ""able to pour a lot of money into something"". ""They just can't do that now. Everything has changed. But I think that is exciting for lots of reasons, and it is an exciting place for artists, even though it's harder to break through.""  He concluded: ""If I go back into it, it'll be because I think it's fun and something I want to do, and not think too much about how it's going to perform.  ""That's pretty much how I try to always feel, but you're in an environment where you have a lot of other stakeholders, and people telling you it needs to be this or that, and there's always that tension."" For now, he is focusing on acting. First performed in 1895, The Importance of being Earnest follows two male friends who adopt fictional personas. The farcical comedy unfolds with mistaken identities and makes generous use of clever wordplay. ""In a nutshell, it's a comedy about two quite ridiculous young men and the double lives they lead,"" Alexander explained. ""They do that to avoid their social obligations, and they both invent these aliases called Ernest, while they try and woo and marry these two young women.  ""But really, it's a comedy that skewers society's expectations, makes fun of class and what society expects of us, and what roles we're expected to perform."" The previous production of the show, starring Gatwa, received a positive reception from critics.  ""There is an elegance to the nudge-wink references and it is a production with just the right amount of delightful mischief,"" wrote the Guardian's Arifa Akbar in a four-star review. The Daily Mail's Patrick Marmion awarded five stars, describing the ""sparkling new production"" as a ""witty reboot"". ""Yes, liberties are taken,"" he said. ""But that is surely the best way of blowing the dust off this national treasure."" In a three-star review, the Telegraph's Dominic Cavendish described the show as ""defiantly bold, but more playful than antagonistic"", although he added he wasn't sure the new iteration ""adds much"" to the original. In the play, nobody except Jack and Algernon know about their alter-egos - something which would be much more difficult to pull off now in an age of smartphones. ""It'd be impossible!"" Alexander laughed. ""Our every movement is captured, so there's less room to invent aliases and lead double lives, which in some circumstances is probably for the best.  ""What's brilliant about the play is it's set 100 years ago, at a time that feels so different to where we are now, but the themes are so timeless."" Alexander last appeared in the West End in 2013, before becoming famous as a pop star, with a relatively small role in Peter & Alice alongside Dame Judi Dench. In 2024, Alexander finished in 18th place at Eurovision with his track Dizzy, in a tricky year for the contest which was partly overshadowed by controversy surrounding Israel's participation. This year's entrants, girl group Remember Monday, ended in a similar position, finishing 19th. Alexander praised their performance, adding that he ""hopes to meet up with them soon and we can exchange stories"". ""But,"" he added, ""I think I'll still be processing and reflecting [on Eurovision] for a long time."" The singer is excited to be returning to the West End, not least because it will mean performing continuously in one venue. ""I spent a lot of my previous years moving around, touring, which is so fun and amazing,"" he reflects. ""But I also very much appreciate staying in one place now. ""Having a home in London with my partner, my cats, just trotting off to the theatre every night - that just sounds like the most wonderful existence."" Copyright 2025 BBC.

6/6/2025,Article,Judge temporarily blocks Trump's ban on foreign Harvard students ,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/c991lz2zd0ko,"A US judge has issued a temporary restraining order blocking the Trump administration from enforcing a ban the president ordered barring Harvard University from accepting international students.  The order by Judge Allison Burroughs, who is based in Massachusetts, said the oldest university in the US would face ""immediate and irreparable injury"" if the proclamation went into effect. It comes in response to a lawsuit filed by Harvard on Thursday accusing President Donald Trump of waging a ""government vendetta"" intended to stifle free speech. Trump has argued that the ban is necessary on national security grounds, and has accused Harvard of not doing enough to stop antisemitism on campus.  The federal judge's order comes only hours after Harvard amended an existing lawsuit against the US government, claiming that Trump's move is ""part of a concerted and escalating campaign of retaliation by the government in clear retribution for Harvard's exercising its First Amendment rights"" to free speech. Harvard President Alan Garber also issued a statement saying that the Ivy League school was developing contingency plans for international students in the event they are not able to travel to campus. The world's wealthiest university has been embroiled in a legal battle with the Trump administration after it froze billions of dollars of federal funding and accused the institution of failing to root out antisemitism on campus. In May, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem revoked certification Harvard needed to enrol foreign students on campus, a move that was swiftly blocked by a judge. The BBC has contacted the DHS for comment on the latest order. Another federal judge upheld that decision last week, saying she would issue a longer-term hold that would allow international students to continue their studies at Harvard while the legal battle plays out. The move triggered Trump's order on Wednesday, which suspended for an initial six months the entry of foreign students seeking to study or participate in exchange programmes at Harvard University. Trump's proclamation accused Harvard of developing ""extensive entanglements"" with foreign countries and continuing to ""flout the civil rights of its students and faculty"". For the 2024-2025 school year, Harvard enrolled nearly 7,000 foreign students, who made up 27% of its population. Copyright 2025 BBC.

6/6/2025,Article,Lululemon shares plunge as Trump tariffs bite,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/c8re86n23j5o,"Lululemon shares have plunged by more than 20% after it cut its annual profit forecast, as the company navigates tariffs and fears about the US economy slowing. ""We experienced lower store traffic in the Americas, partially reflective of economic uncertainty, inflationary pressures, lower consumer confidence, and changes in discretionary spending,"" Lululemon said in a statement. The athleisure brand joins a growing list of big companies to warn about the impact of US President Donald Trump's trade policies.  The Trump administration's approach to tariffs has triggered concerns over rising prices and a weakening economy. ""We are planning to take strategic price increases... on a small portion of our assortment, and they will be modest in nature,"" Lululemon's finance chief Meghan Frank said. The company also said it will cut costs and negotiate with its vendors. Last year, 40% of its products were made in Vietnam, and 28% of its fabrics came from mainland China. Clothing and footwear brands are among the businesses hit hardest by tariffs as they make goods in Asian countries, which have faced steep levies from the US. In April, sportswear giant Adidas warned that import taxes imposed by Trump will lead to higher prices in the US for popular trainers including the Gazelle and Samba. ""Since we currently cannot produce almost any of our products in the US, these higher tariffs will eventually cause higher costs for all our products for the US market,"" chief executive Bjorn Gulden said. Also in April, footwear maker Skechers withdrew its annual results forecast, citing economic uncertainty. ""The current environment is simply too dynamic from which to plan results with a reasonable assurance of success,"" Skechers' chief operating officer, David Weinberg, told investors in a post-earnings call. Last month, Nike said it would raise prices on some trainers and clothing in the US from early June. The sportswear giant did not name US tariffs explicitly as a reason for the increase, saying it regularly made ""price adjustments"". Copyright 2025 BBC.

6/6/2025,Article,Beyoncé dazzles on first night of London residency after slow ticket sales,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/cvgvlxk01gvo,"Beyoncé signed off the first night of her London residency by telling fans she was ""blessed"" to get to do what she loves by performing on stage. She stormed through a seven-act set at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, treating the audience to a spectacle that lasted just shy of three hours. But despite this being the first opportunity for fans to enjoy the singer's country era in person, slow ticket sales and high prices have been the hot topic around the tour. Promoters slashed some ticket prices in the run-up to shows in a bid to fill the stadium, prompting some of those who bought seats in advance to feel short-changed. Beyoncé's rodeo rumbled into London, bringing with it every country cliché you could think of - cowboy hats, horseshoes, tassels and even a gold mechanical bull. The 40-song setlist relied heavily on tracks from 2024's Cowboy Carter, which was met with critical acclaim, including taking the top album prize at this year's Grammy Awards. Every element of the performance was flawless, from the 43-year-old superstar's stunning array of costume changes (each one featuring more rhinestones than the last) to the seamless transitions between songs and musical themes. Much of the talk around the US leg of this tour, which took place in April and May, was the inclusion of Beyoncé and Jay-Z's 13-year-old daughter Blue Ivy. She made several appearances throughout the show, earning thunderous applause whilst dancing to an instrumental performance of her mum's 2006 hit Deja Vu. The teenager certainly seemed to enjoy her moment in the spotlight, unlike her younger sister, Rumi, who came on stage during Protector, shyly mouthing the words whilst being held by Beyoncé.  The show, which is called The Cowboy Carter and the Rodeo Chitlin' Circuit Tour as a way of referencing black performers that were segregated from the country scene, often paid homage in its interludes to these artists. Beyoncé herself previously hinted about being rejected from the country music world in the past and throughout the performance it felt like she was wrestling with this idea. She blended some of her biggest hits into Cowboy Carter tracks, such as Freedom and Diva, almost to prove that she belonged in this space. Thursday night's performance certainly showed she is more than qualified to be a country singer, but perhaps that a 60,000 seater stadium is not the best arena for it. As the night drew darker, Beyoncé delivered an act comprised of tracks from her house-inspired album Renaissance, which immediately lifted the crowd into a party mood. LED wristbands lit up in array of colours as she belted out Alien Superstar and I'm That Girl - which certainly got the best reaction from fans of the night. Similarly a section of old classics such as Crazy In Love and Irreplaceable had the crowd singing every word, proving perhaps that a few more classics wouldn't have gone amiss. With crowds on their feet, it was difficult to see how sold out the stadium actually was, but with just hours to go until the show there were still thousands of tickets available for sale online. Despite the tour only stopping in two European cities - London and Paris - the remaining eight dates are not sold out. Beyoncé's tour has the highest top-priced ticket of any artist visiting the UK in 2025 at £950, with the cheapest costing £71. Some seats that were sold in the Beyhive fan presale for £620 excluding fees are next to seats that were available this week for £141.60, also without fees. Zulkarnain Sadali flew from Singapore to London to watch Beyoncé perform live and bought a ticket in the pre-sale, which he said cost him ""more than £700"". ""A couple of weeks ago I checked my ticket and then curiosity got the best of me and I checked the same ticket, or same category, and the price was around £300,"" he told the BBC. ""I'm really excited for [the show] but I will say the dynamic pricing really left a sour taste in my mouth."" Another fan, Holly Whiteman, said she ""panic bought"" Beyoncé tickets in a fan pre-sale on Ticketmaster, which were ""way up in the nosebleeds"" and cost £170 each, when she had initially set a budget of £100. ""Fast forward a few days later, the tickets went on general sale through Tottenham Hotspur and I found tickets for the same show in both the same row and the same section for a much cheaper price,"" she told the BBC. ""I believe they were at least £50-£70 cheaper per ticket."" Sadali said that despite feeling short-changed, it had not dented his excitement for the tour. ""It's really about the Beyoncé experience, you're not gonna get it anywhere else and I know this sounds like a contradiction, it's worth every cent,"" he said. Whiteman said the process had left her a bit ""disappointed"", but she was still looking forward to the tour. A Ticketmaster spokesperson told the BBC they do ""not use surge pricing or dynamic algorithms to adjust ticket prices"", adding that event organisers are responsible for the pricing structures. ""Since tickets typically go on sale at least 3-6 months before the event, organisers may review prices at key points leading up to the show, but they make any adjustments, not an algorithm,"" they also added. The BBC also contacted tour promoter Live Nation for comment. Ticketing expert Reg Walker put the lack of sold-out shows down to several factors, including ""overexposure"" after her last UK stadium tour, which played five nights at the same venue in 2023. And the ticket prices are ""eye-watering"", he told the BBC. ""You might be able to afford to go to one of her concerts where you're effectively paying, in some categories, the same amount of money as a small holiday, but you can't do that on consecutive years. ""The pricing strategy on tickets was clearly far too high,"" he added. Walker said there were a lot of ""affordably priced"" tours coming up - but with so many artists visiting the UK this summer, fans may be picking and choosing who they pay to go and see. Billie Eilish, Lana Del Rey, Dua Lipa, Kendrick Lamar and SZA are all embarking on stadium tours over the coming months, with Olivia Rodrigo, Sabrina Carpenter, Chapell Roan and Drake headlining festivals.

6/6/2025,Article,The long wait for answers over the Lockerbie bombing grows longer,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/c3v52yw335xo,"Major television productions are bringing the story of the Lockerbie bombing to a new global audience, but the real life drama of the trial of a new Libyan suspect has been delayed once more. Abu Agila Mohammed Mas'ud Kheir al-Marimi, known as Masud, had been due to face a Washington jury last month, accused of making the bomb that destroyed Pan Am Flight 103 and killed 270 people. The 12 May starting date was abandoned because of problems with his health and the complexity of the case, and the trial is now scheduled to start in April, 2026.. The date was set at the District of Columbia District Court, where Masud listened with the help of a translator and was expressionless throughout. After the hearing, relatives of American victims of the bombing told BBC News of their disappointment that the trial is now scheduled to start 50 weeks later than originally planned. Kara Weipz is the president of the US group Victims of Pan Am Flight 103 and lost her 20-year-old brother Richard Monetti on the plane. ""I'm just going to pray that it stays at 20 April,"" she said. ""I was 15 when this happened, and I'm 52 now and among the relatives I'm considered young. ""A lot of our family members are in their seventies and eighties and unfortunately, we lose them weekly or monthly now. ""The travesty in all of this that they're not seeing the justice that they've worked 37 years to see. ""That's what concerns us the most, that this trial will come around and we'll have lost more family members."" Victoria Cummock's husband John was coming home from a business trip to Europe a day earlier than planned, to surprise his family. The founder of the Pan Am 103 Lockerbie Legacy Foundation, Mrs Cummock said: ""We've lived through 36 years of delays and postponements simply because this is an international case filled with politics. ""Thirty six years with seven different administrations in America have really collided with the families' search for accountability and justice. ""It's no surprise that our mission to hold them to account is being delayed."" Mrs Cummock added she was concerned that President Trump's ban on Libyan citizens travelling to the US could affect the trial. She said: ""It just seems like it's a very slow journey to getting this case started."" Masud has been in US custody since December 2022 and has pled not guilty to the charges. The Tunisian-born Libyan is in his seventies and is understood to have diabetes and heart problems. His family in Libya has already expressed concerns over the delays to the case, saying he's an innocent man. The new trial date was fixed after a joint motion submitted by the prosecution and the defence, both of whom raised the international nature of the evidence and witnesses. A series of crucial legal arguments will have to be resolved before the trial can go ahead, with the judge Dabney Friedrich describing the 20 April date as ""tentative."" Those will include the admissibility of a confession Masud is alleged to have made while in custody in 2012, following the collapse of Colonel Gaddafi's regime. Another complication is the fact that new information on the case is still emerging, almost four decades after the attack. A book published in France revealed the existence of documents said to have been retrieved from the archives of the Libyan intelligence service, of which Masud is alleged to have been a member. If proved genuine, those documents detail his involvement in preparations for the attack on Pan Am 103. It's more than 24 years since the first Lockerbie trial, when three Scottish judges convicted Libyan intelligence agent Abdulbasset al-Megrahi of playing a key role in the plot. Megrahi was jailed for life but released on compassionate grounds by the Scottish government in 2009 after he was diagnosed with terminal cancer. He died three years later at home in Tripoli. His release infuriated many of the American relatives, which is why they have set so much store on the trial of Masud, the first suspect to face an American court over Lockerbie. They believe it will deliver the justice they were denied by the Scottish legal system. The bombing remains the worst terror attack in British history and claimed the lives of 43 UK citizens. Some, but not all, of the British relatives have never accepted the verdict against Megrahi, including the Rev John Mosey, whose daughter Helga was on the plane. ""I think they're just waiting for people like me to pop our clogs and get out of the way,"" he said. ""I'm still pretty cynical about the whole thing. I would like to be proved wrong but I can't see it happening. ""As far as I'm concerned, who made the bomb and who put in on the plane are secondary as to who were the main criminals. ""They were the group of people who had all the warnings that this was going to happen and warned their own people but didn't warn the public."" The big budget television dramas may have pushed the Lockerbie bombing back into the public eye but it's clear that there's a very long way to go before a jury delivers its verdict on Masud. Judge Friedrich warned that if things are not done in a timely manner, there's a risk the trial could ""slip"" into 2027. As she reminded everyone in the court: ""This isn't a normal criminal case.""

6/7/2025,Article,Polo-loving drug lord's double life catches up with him,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c14jpymxrkno,"On the surface, Muhammed Asif Hafeez was an upstanding individual. A global businessman and ambassador of a prestigious London polo club, he rubbed shoulders with the British elite, including members of the Royal Family. He also regularly passed on detailed information to the authorities in the UK and Middle East that, in some cases, led to the interception of huge shipments of drugs. He was motivated, he said, simply by what he saw as his ""moral obligation to curb and highlight criminal activities"". At least, that is what he would have had people think. In reality, Hafeez was himself what US officials described as ""one of the world's most prolific drug traffickers"". From his residence in the UK, he was the puppet-master of a vast drugs empire, supplying many tonnes of heroin, methamphetamine and hashish from bases in Pakistan and India that were distributed across the world. The gangs he informed on were his rivals - and his motivation was to rid the market of his competitors. His status in the underworld earned him the moniker ""the Sultan"". But this criminal power and prestige would not last forever. After a complex joint operation between the British and American authorities, Hafeez, 66, was extradited from the UK in 2023. He pleaded guilty last November.  On Friday, he was sentenced to 16 years in a New York prison for conspiring to import drugs - including enough heroin for ""millions of doses"" - into the US. Having been in custody since 2017, Hafeez’s sentence will end in 2033. The BBC has closely followed Hafeez's case. We have pieced together information from court documents, corporate listings and interviews with people who knew him. We wanted to find out how he managed to stay under the radar for so long - and how he eventually got caught. Hafeez was born in September 1958 to a middle-class family in Lahore, Pakistan. One of six children, his upbringing was comfortable. People in Lahore who knew the family told the BBC that his father had owned a factory near the city. Hafeez also later told a US court that he had trained as a commercial pilot. From the early 1990s to about the mid-2010s, he ran an outwardly legitimate umbrella company called Sarwani International Corporation, with subsidiary businesses in Pakistan, the UAE and the UK. According to its website - which has since been shut down - it sold technical equipment to militaries, governments and police forces throughout the world, including equipment for drug detection. Among the other businesses under the Sarwani umbrella were a textiles company registered in various countries, an Italian restaurant in Lahore that was a franchise of a well-known Knightsbridge brand, and a company named Tipmoor, based near Windsor to the west of London, which specialised in ""polo and equestrian services"". These businesses not only afforded him a luxury lifestyle, but secured him access to the UK's most exclusive circles. He was listed as an international ambassador for the prestigious Ham Polo Club for at least three years, from 2009 to 2011. He and his wife Shahina were also photographed chatting to Prince William, and embracing Prince Harry, at the club in 2009. Ham Polo Club told the BBC that Hafeez had never been a member of the club, that the club no longer has ""ambassadors"", and that the current board ""has no ties to him"". It added that the event at which Hafeez and his wife were photographed meeting the princes ""was run by a third party"". Sarwani's different global arms were dissolved at various stages in the 2010s, according to their listings on Companies House and equivalent global registries. A former Sarwani employee based in the UAE told the BBC he suspected there had been ""something fishy going on"" when he worked for the business, because even big projects were ""only paid for in cash"". The employee - who has asked not to be identified, for fear of reprisals - said he eventually left the business because he felt uncomfortable with this. ""There were no [bank] transactions, no records, no existence,"" he told the BBC. Hafeez would also periodically write letters to the authorities in the UAE and UK informing on rival cartels, under the guise of being a concerned member of the public. The BBC has seen these, as well as letters he received in response from the British Embassy in Dubai and the UK Home Office, thanking him and expressing their appreciation for him getting in touch. The Home Office told the BBC it does not comment on individual correspondence. The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office and the Government of Dubai were contacted by the BBC for comment but did not respond. Members of Hafeez's family shared these letters with the BBC in 2018, while he was embroiled in a lengthy legal fight against extradition to the US.  They also submitted them to courts in the UK and, later, to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR), as evidence that he had been an informant and needed protection. All the courts disagreed and ruled that this was a ploy by Hafeez to rid the market of competitors. Hafeez, the ECHR said, was ""someone who had brought to the attention of the authorities the criminal conduct of others who he knew to be actual or potential rivals to his substantial criminal enterprise"". While Hafeez was writing these letters, a meeting took place in 2014 that - despite him not being there - would lead to his downfall. Two of Hafeez's close associates met a potential buyer from Colombia in a flat in Mombasa, Kenya. They burned a small amount of heroin in order to demonstrate how pure it was, and said they could supply him with any quantity of ""100%... white crystal"". The supplier of this high-quality heroin, they had told the buyer, was a man from Pakistan known as ""the Sultan"" - that is, Hafeez. What they would soon learn was that the ""buyer"" from Colombia was actually working undercover for the US's Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). The entire meeting was part of an elaborate sting operation, and had been covertly filmed - footage that has been obtained by the BBC. US court documents reveal the deal was co-ordinated by Baktash and Ibrahim Akasha, two brothers who led a violent cartel in Kenya. Their father was himself a feared kingpin who had been killed in Amsterdam's Red Light District in 2000. The deal also involved Vijaygiri ""Vicky"" Goswami, an Indian national who managed the Akashas' operations. In October 2014, with the Akashas, Goswami and Hafeez still unaware of who the buyers really were, 99kg of heroin and 2kg of crystal meth were delivered to the fake Colombian traffickers. The Akashas promised to provide hundreds of kilograms more of each drug. A month later, the Akasha brothers and Goswami were arrested in Mombasa. They were released on bail shortly afterwards, and spent over two years fighting extradition to the US. In the background, American law enforcers were working with counterparts in the UK to piece together their case against Hafeez, partly using evidence gathered from devices they had seized when they arrested Goswami and the Akasha brothers. On those, they had found multiple references to Hafeez as a major supplier, and were able to find enough evidence to identify him as ""the Sultan"". Facing charges in the US didn't stop one of the men, Goswami, from continuing his illegal enterprise. In 2015, while on bail in Kenya, he hatched a plan with Hafeez to transport several tonnes of a drug called ephedrine from a chemical factory in Solapur, India, to Mozambique. Ephedrine, a powerful medication that is legal in limited quantities, is used to make methamphetamine. The two men - Goswami and Hafeez - planned to set up a meth factory in Mozambique's capital, Maputo, US court documents show. But their scheme was abandoned in 2016, when police raided the Solapur plant and seized 18 tonnes of ephedrine. The Akasha brothers and Goswami finally boarded a flight to the US to face trial in January 2017.  Hafeez was arrested eight months later in London, at his flat in the affluent St John's Wood neighbourhood. He was detained at high security Belmarsh Prison in south-east London, and it was from there that he spent six years fighting extradition to the US. A big development happened in 2019 in the US. Goswami pleaded guilty, and told a New York court he had agreed to co-operate with prosecutors. The Akasha brothers also pleaded guilty. Baktash Akasha was sentenced to 25 years in prison. His brother Ibrahim was sentenced to 23 years. Goswami, who is yet to be sentenced, would have testified against Hafeez in the US had the case gone to trial. From Belmarsh, Hafeez was running out of options. He tried to stop extradition to the US - but failed to convince magistrates, the High Court in London and the ECHR that he had, in fact, been an informant to the authorities who was ""at risk of ill-treatment from his fellow prisoners"" as a result.  He also claimed the conditions in a US prison would be ""inhuman and degrading"" for him because of his health conditions, including type 2 diabetes and asthma. He lost all of these arguments at every stage and was extradited in May 2023. His case did not go to trial. In November last year, Hafeez pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiring to manufacture and distribute heroin, methamphetamine and hashish and to import them into the US.  Pre-sentencing, prosecutors described the ""extremely fortunate circumstances"" of Hafeez's life, which ""throw into harsh relief his decision to scheme... and to profit from the distribution of dangerous substances that destroy lives and whole communities"". ""Unlike many traffickers whose drug activities are borne, at least in part, from desperation, poverty, and a lack of educational opportunities,"" they said, ""the defendant has lived a life replete with privilege and choice.""

6/7/2025,Article,We always joked dad looked nothing like his parents - then we found out why,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gexw7l7rwo,"Matthew's dad had brown eyes and black hair. His grandparents had piercing blue eyes. There was a running joke in his family that ""dad looked nothing like his parents"", the teacher from southern England says. It turned out there was a very good reason for this. Matthew's father had been swapped at birth in hospital nearly 80 years ago. He died late last year before learning the truth of his family history. Matthew - not his real name - contacted the BBC after we reported on the case of Susan, who received compensation from an NHS trust after a home DNA test revealed she had been accidentally switched for another baby in the 1950s. BBC News is now aware of five cases of babies swapped by mistake in maternity wards from the late 1940s to the 1960s. Lawyers say they expect more people to come forward driven by the increase in cheap genetic testing. During the pandemic, Matthew started looking for answers to niggling questions about his family history. He sent off a saliva sample in the post to be analysed. The genealogy company entered his record into its vast online database, allowing him to view other users whose DNA closely matched his own. ""Half of the names I'd just never heard of,"" he says. ""I thought, 'That's weird', and called my wife to tell her the old family joke might be true after all."" Matthew then asked his dad to submit his own DNA sample, which confirmed he was even more closely related to the same group of mysterious family members. Matthew started exchanging messages with two women who the site suggested were his father's cousins. All were confused about how they could possibly be related. Working together, they eventually tracked down birth records from 1946, months after the end of World War Two. The documents showed that one day after his father was apparently born, another baby boy had been registered at the same hospital in east London. That boy had the same relatively unusual surname that appeared on the mystery branch of the family tree, a link later confirmed by birth certificates obtained by Matthew. It was a lightbulb moment. ""I realised straight away what must have happened,"" he says. ""The only explanation that made sense was that both babies got muddled up in hospital."" Matthew and the two women managed to construct a brand new family tree based on all of his DNA matches. ""I love a puzzle and I love understanding the past,"" he says. ""I'm quite obsessive anyway, so I got into trying to reverse engineer what had happened."" Before World War Two, most babies in the UK were born at home, or in nursing homes, attended by midwives and the family doctor. That started to change as the country prepared for the launch of the NHS in 1948, and very gradually, more babies were delivered in hospital, where newborns were typically removed for periods to be cared for in nurseries. ""The baby would be taken away between feeds so that the mother could rest, and the baby could be watched by either a nursery nurse or midwife,"" says Terri Coates, a retired lecturer in midwifery, and former clinical adviser on BBC series Call The Midwife. ""It may sound paternalistic, but midwives believed they were looking after mums and babies incredibly well."" It was common for new mothers to be kept in hospital for between five and seven days, far longer than today. To identify newborns in the nursery, a card would be tied to the end of the cot with the baby's name, mother's name, the date and time of birth, and the baby's weight. ""Where cots rather than babies were labelled, accidents could easily happen"", says Ms Coates, who trained as a nurse herself in the 1970s and a midwife in 1981. ""If there were two or more members of staff in the nursery feeding babies, for example, a baby could easily be put down in the wrong cot."" By 1956, hospital births were becoming more common, and midwifery textbooks were recommending that a ""wrist name-tape"" or ""string of lettered china beads"" should be attached directly to the newborn. A decade later, by the mid-1960s, it was rare for babies to be removed from the delivery room without being individually labelled. Stories of babies being accidentally switched in hospital were very rare at the time, though more are now coming to light thanks to the boom in genetic testing and ancestry websites. The day after Jan Daly was born at a hospital in north London in 1951, her mother immediately complained that the baby she had been given was not hers. ""She was really stressed and crying, but the nurses assured her she was wrong and the doctor was called in to try to calm her,"" Jan says. The staff only backed down when her mum told them she'd had a fast, unassisted delivery, and pointed out the clear forceps marks on the baby's head ""I feel for the other mother who had been happily feeding me for two days and then had to give up one baby for another,"" she says. ""There was never any apology, it was just 'one of those silly errors', but the trauma affected my mother for a long time."" Matthew's father, an insurance agent from the Home Counties, was a keen amateur cyclist who spent his life following the local racing scene. He lived alone in retirement and over the last decade his health had been deteriorating.  Matthew thought long and hard about telling him the truth about his family history but, in the end, decided against it.  ""I just felt my dad doesn't need this,"" he says. ""He had lived 78 years in a type of ignorance, so it didn't feel right to share it with him."" Matthew's father died last year without ever knowing he'd been celebrating his birthday a day early for the past eight decades. Since then, Matthew has driven to the West Country to meet his dad's genetic first cousin and her daughter for coffee. They all got on well, he says, sharing old photos and ""filling in missing bits of family history"". But Matthew has decided not to contact the man his father must have been swapped with as a baby, or his children – in part because they have not taken DNA tests themselves. ""If you do a test by sending your saliva off, then there's an implicit understanding that you might find something that's a bit of a surprise,"" Matthew says.

6/7/2025,Article,US brings back El Salvador deportee to face charges,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7v7ynv98r8o,"Kilmar Ábrego García, a 29-year-old from El Salvador mistakenly deported in March, has been returned to the US to face prosecution on two federal criminal charges. He has been accused of participating in a trafficking conspiracy over several years to move undocumented migrants from Texas to other parts of the country.  El Salvador agreed to release Mr Ábrego García after the US presented it with an arrest warrant, US Attorney General Pam Bondi said on Friday. His lawyer called the charges ""preposterous"". The White House had been resisting a US Supreme Court order from April to ""facilitate"" his return after he was sent to a jail in El Salvador alongside more than 250 other deportees.  In a two-count grand jury indictment, filed in a Tennessee court last month and unsealed on Friday, Mr Ábrego García was charged with one count of conspiracy to transport aliens and a second count of unlawful transportation of undocumented aliens.  Bondi said the grand jury had found that Mr Ábrego García had played a ""significant role"" in an alien smuggling ring, bringing in thousands of illegal immigrants to the US. The charges, which date back to 2016, allege he transported undocumented individuals between Texas and Maryland and other states more than 100 times.   The indictment also alleges he transported members of MS-13, designated a foreign terrorist organisation by the US.  The Trump administration had previously alleged Mr Ábrego García was a member of the transnational Salvadorian gang, which he has denied.  Bondi also accused Mr Ábrego García of trafficking weapons and narcotics into the US for the gang, though he was not charged with any related offences.    He appeared in court for an initial hearing on Friday in Nashville, Tennessee. An arraignment hearing is scheduled 13 June, where US Magistrate Judge Barbara Holmes will determine if there are grounds to keep him detained ahead of his trial.  For now, Mr Ábrego García remains in federal custody. Mr Ábrego García's lawyers have previously argued that he had never been convicted of any criminal offence, including gang membership, in the US or in El Salvador. Simon Sandoval Moshenberg, one of his attorneys, called the events an ""abuse of power"" at a news conference on Friday.  ""The government disappeared Kilmar to a foreign prison in violation of a court order,"" Mr Moshenberg said. ""Now, after months of delay and secrecy, they're bringing him back, not to correct their error but to prosecute him."" He added: ""This is an abuse of power, not justice. The government should give him a full and fair trial in front of the same immigration judge who heard the case in 2019."" US President Donald Trump called Mr Ábrego García a ""bad guy"" while speaking to reporters on Friday, and said the US Department of Justice had made the right decision to return him to face trial. Mr Ábrego García entered the US illegally as a teenager from El Salvador. In 2019, he was arrested with three other men in Maryland and detained by federal immigration authorities. But an immigration judge granted him protection from deportation on the grounds that he might be at risk of persecution from local gangs in his home country. On 15 March, he was deported amid an immigration crackdown by the Trump administration, after it invoked the Alien Enemies Act, a wartime law that allows presidents to detain or deport the natives and citizens of an enemy country. Mr Ábrego García was taken to the Cecot mega-prison in El Salvador, known for its brutal conditions.  While government lawyers initially said he was taken there as a result of ""administrative error"", the Trump administration refused to order his return.  Whether or not the government had to ""facilitate"" his return to his home in the US state of Maryland became the subject of a weeks-long legal and political battle. After Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen demanded to see Mr Ábrego García in El Salvador, he was released to a different prison in that country.  Van Hollen reiterated on Friday that ""this is not about the man, it's about his constitutional rights - and the rights of all"".  ""The administration will now have to make its case in the court of law, as it should have all along.""  El Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele, a close ally of Trump, wrote on social media on Friday that if the administration ""request the return of a gang member to face charges, of course we wouldn't refuse"".  At Mr Ábrego García's court appearance in Tennessee next Friday, the US will request he be held in pretrial custody ""because he poses a danger to the community and a serious risk of flight"", according to the detention motion.

6/7/2025,Article,Will Musk's explosive row with Trump help or harm his businesses?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ceqgdnd2g9xo,"When Elon Musk recently announced that he was stepping back from politics, investors hoped that would mean he would step up his involvement in the many tech firms he runs. His explosive row with US President Donald Trump - and the very public airing of his dirty White House laundry - suggests Musk's changing priorities might not quite be the salve they had been hoping for. Instead of Musk retreating somewhat from the public eye and focusing on boosting the fortunes of Tesla and his other enterprises, he now finds himself being threatened with a boycott from one of his main customers - Trump's federal government. Tesla shares were sent into freefall on Thursday - falling 14% - as he sounded off about Trump on social media. They rebounded a little on Friday following some indications tempers were cooling. Even so, for the investors and analysts who, for months, had made clear they wanted Musk off his phone and back at work, the situation is far from ideal. Some argue, though, that the problems for Musk's businesses run much deeper than this spat - and the controversial role in the Trump administration it has brought a spectacular end to. For veteran tech journalist Kara Swisher, this is especially so for Tesla. ""Tesla's finished,"" she told the BBC on the sidelines of the San Francisco Media Summit early this week.  ""It was a great car company. They could compete in the autonomous taxi space but they're way behind."" Tesla has long attempted to play catch-up against rival Waymo, owned by Google's parent, Alphabet, whose driverless taxis have traversed the streets of San Francisco for years - and now operate in several more cities. This month, Musk is supposed to be overseeing Tesla's launch of a batch of autonomous robo-taxis in Austin, Texas. He posted on X last week that the electric vehicle maker had been testing the Model Y with no drivers on board. ""I believe 90% of the future value of Tesla is going to be autonomous and robotics,"" Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives told the BBC this week, adding that the Austin launch would be ""a watershed moment"". ""The first task at hand is ensuring the autonomous vision gets off to a phenomenal start,"" he added. But with Musk's attention divided, the project's odds of success would appear to have lengthened. And there's something else to factor in too: Musk's own motivation. The talk in Silicon Valley lately centres less on whether Musk can turn things around and more on whether he even cares. ""He's a really powerful person when he's focused on something,"" said Ross Gerber, President and CEO of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Management. ""Before, it was about proving to the world that he would make EVs - the tech that nobody else could do. It was about proving he could make rockets. He had a lot to prove."" A longtime Tesla investor, Mr Gerber has soured on the stock and has been paring back his holdings since Musk's foray into right-wing politics. He called Thursday an ""extremely painful day"". ""It's the dumbest thing you could possibly do to think that you have more power than the president of the United States,"" Mr Gerber said, referring to Musk's social media tirade against Trump. The BBC contacted X, Tesla, and SpaceX seeking comment but did not receive a response. A particular problem for Musk is that, before he seemingly created an enemy in Trump, he already had one in the grassroots social media campaign against his car-maker. Protests, collectively dubbed #TeslaTakedown, have played out across the country every weekend since Trump took office. In April, Tesla reported a 20% drop in car sales for the first three months of the year. Profits plunged more than 70%, and the share price went down with it. ""He should not be deciding the fate of our democracy by disassembling our government piece by piece. It's not right,"" protestor Linda Koistinen told me at a demonstration outside a Berkeley, California Tesla dealership in February. Ms Koistinen said she wanted to make a ""visible stand"" against Musk personally. ""Ultimately it's not about the tech or the Tesla corporation,"" said Joan Donovan, a prominent disinformation researcher who co-organised the #TeslaTakedown protests on social media. ""It's about the way in which the stock of Tesla has been able to be weaponised against the people and it has put Musk in such a position to have an incredible amount of power with no transparency."" Another aspect of Musk's empire that has raised the ire of his detractors is X, the social media platform once known as Twitter. ""He bought Twitter so that he had clout and would be able to - at the drop of a hat - reach hundreds of millions of people,"" Ms Donovan said. There is another possibility here though. Could Musk's high-profile falling out with Trump help rehabilitate him in the eyes of people who turned against him because of his previous closeness to the president? Patrick Moorhead, chief analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy, thinks it could. ""We're a very forgiving country,"" he said. ""These things take time,"" Mr Moorhead acknowledged, but ""it's not unprecedented"". Ms Swisher likened Musk's personal brand to that of Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates more than two decades ago. She said Gates was once regarded as ""the Darth Vader of Silicon Valley"" because of his ""arrogant and rude"" personality. Today, despite his flaws, Gates has largely rehabilitated his image. ""He learned. He grew up. People can change,"" Ms Swisher said, even though Musk is ""clearly troubled"". The problem for Musk is the future for him and his companies is not just about what he does - but what Trump decides too. And while Trump needed Musk in the past, not least to help fund his presidential race, it's not so clear he does now. Noah Smith, writer of the Noahpinion Substack, said Trump's highly lucrative foray into cryptocurrencies - as unseemly as it has been - may have freed him from depending on Musk to carry out his will. ""My guess is that this was so he could get out from under Elon,"" he said. In Trump's most menacing comment of the day, he suggested cutting Musk's government contracts, which have an estimated value of $38bn (£28bn). A significant chunk of that goes to Musk's rocket company SpaceX - seemingly threatening its future. However, despite the bluster, Trump's warning may be a little more hollow than it seems. That's because SpaceX's Dragon spacecraft ferries people and cargo to the International Space Station where three Nasa astronauts are currently posted. It demonstrates that SpaceX has so entrenched itself in the US space and national security apparatus, that Trump's threat could be difficult to carry out. You could make a similar argument about Musk's internet satellite company, Starlink. Finding an alternative could be easier said than done. But, if there are limits on what Trump can do, the same is also true of Musk. In the middle of his row with Trump, he threatened to decommission the Dragon - but it wasn't long before he was rowing back. Responding to an X user's suggestion he that he ""cool down"", he wrote: ""Good advice. Ok, we won’t decommission Dragon."" It's clear Musk and Trump's friendship is over. It's less certain their reliance on each other is. Whatever the future for Musk's businesses is then, it seems Trump - and his administration's actions - will continue to have a big say in them.

He said Musk was only against the legislation because his company, Tesla, will be hurt by the push to end electric vehicle tax credits. Just three months ago, Trump showed off a Tesla on the White House lawn he said he purchased. Now it's reported by CBS, the BBC's US partner, that Trump is considering selling the car.

6/7/2025,Article,Ten days that unravelled their relationship,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyr7v79q4yo,"The pairing of Donald Trump and Elon Musk, the leader of the richest country in the world with the richest person in the world, seemed a perfect match. But the last 10 days have seen the pair move from gentle disagreement to bitter acrimony. These are the public moments which brought their relationship crashing down. Speaking to CBS News, Musk criticises Trump's plans for a new bill on tax and spending - saying the planned legislation left him ""disappointed"". Trump later admits to reporters that he is ""not happy about certain aspects"" of the bill while at the same time being ""thrilled"" about some aspects, such as tax cuts. He doesn't comment directly on Musk's remarks, however. Musk announces he will be leaving the Trump administration after his scheduled time as a special government employee reaches its end. He had led a cost-cutting mission known as the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge). Trump praises Musk as the latter appears with a black eye in a press conference on his last day at the White House. Musk is ""not really leaving"", the president says, and will continue to be ""back and forth"" to the White House. Trump defends his ""big, beautiful bill"" in a post on Truth Social, claiming ""many false statements"" are being made about his landmark economic policy. Musk again attacks Trump's planned bill, calling it ""massive, outrageous, pork-filled"" and ""a disgusting abomination"" in a post on X. In US politics, ""pork"" refers to spending on projects in lawmakers' constituencies. It marks the start of an escalation in comments from Musk on social media. Musk calls for a new spending bill ""that doesn't massively grow the [US government budget] deficit and increase the debt ceiling"". Musk urges his followers to call their representatives to oppose Trump's bill. Musk quotes a series of old posts on X by Trump, from 2012 and 2013, in which Trump criticises government spending.  Speaking in the Oval Office alongside German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Trump says he and Musk ""had"" a great relationship but ""I don't know if we will anymore"". He also says Musk is ""upset"" that subsidies for electric vehicles would be cut in his planned bill, affecting the billionaire's Tesla and SpaceX businesses. Musk responds in real-time to the broadcast from the Oval Office, dismissing Trump's assertions. Back at the White House, Trump tells reporters Musk knew ""every aspect of the bill"" and says he is ""very disappointed in Elon"". ""False,"" replies Musk on X. ""This bill was never shown to me even once and was passed in the dead of night so fast that almost no-one in Congress would even read it!"" Musk resurfaces old Trump posts on X, highlighting moments when the president criticised America's budget deficits. ""Where is this guy today??"" he asks. Replying to another user on X, Musk says: ""Without me, Trump would have lost the election."" He goes on to say: ""Such ingratitude"". Still going, Musk claims on X that ""the Big Ugly Bill will INCREASE the deficit to $2.5 trillion"". Musk continues to quote old Trump posts on X about government spending. He asks: ""Where is the man who wrote these words? Was he replaced by a body double!?"" ""Is it time to create a new political party in America that actually represents the 80% in the middle?"" Musk asks in a poll on X. Trump starts posting on his Truth Social platform, saying Musk had been ""wearing thin"" so he asked him to leave the White House, and alleging that Musk ""went CRAZY"". Musk calls this ""an obvious lie"". ""The easiest way to save money in our Budget,"" Trump continues in another post, ""is to terminate Elon's Governmental Subsidies and Contracts"". Musk alleges, without providing evidence, that Trump appears in the ""Epstein files"", referring to court documents and evidence collected by investigators into convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Posting on Truth Social, Trump says he doesn't mind ""Elon turning against me"" and continues to defend his bill. Responding to Trump's suggestion that he could terminate government contracts with Musk's companies, Musk says he will ""immediately"" decommission the Dragon spacecraft - a craft that is capable of travelling to the International Space Station. Musk appears to endorse impeaching Trump while quoting a conspiracy theorist who shared his Epstein files claim about the president. Musk attacks another of Trump's signature policies - his trade tariffs - by posting on X to say these ""will cause a recession in the second half of this year"". Musk appears to soften, replying on X ""you're not wrong"" to another billionaire Trump backer, Bill Ackman, who had called for the pair to ""make peace for the benefit of our great country"". Trump describes Musk as ""the man who has lost his mind"" in an interview with ABC News and says he is ""not particularly"" interested in speaking to him. The White House tells the BBC Trump does not intend to talk to the tech billionaire today, after reports they would speak on the phone later. It is also reported by CBS, the BBC's US partner, that Trump is considering selling his Tesla car - which he had purchased when he was trying to help Musk promote his company. Copyright 2025 BBC.

The partnership between the two men began when Musk endorsed Trump last July after an assassination attempt in Pennsylvania. Musk later went on to campaign for the president there and even gave away a few $1m cheques to voters.

6/7/2025,Article,The decades-old intrigue over an Indian guest house in Mecca,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy3gqz48qzo,"As the annual Hajj pilgrimage draws to a close, a long-settled corner of Mecca is stirring up a storm thousands of miles away in India - not for its spiritual significance, but for a 50-year-old inheritance dispute. At the heart of the controversy is Keyi Rubath, a 19th-Century guest house built in the 1870s by Mayankutty Keyi, a wealthy Indian merchant from Malabar (modern-day Kerala), whose trading empire stretched from Mumbai to Paris. Located near Islam's holiest site, Masjid al-Haram, the building was demolished in 1971 to make way for Mecca's expansion. Saudi authorities deposited 1.4 million riyals (about $373,000 today) in the kingdom's treasury as compensation, but said no rightful heir could be identified at the time. Decades later, that sum - still held in Saudi Arabia's treasury - has sparked a bitter  tussle between two sprawling branches of the Keyi family, each trying to prove its lineage and claim what they see as their rightful inheritance. Neither side has succeeded so far. For decades, successive Indian governments - both at the Centre and in Kerala - have tried and failed to resolve the deadlock. It remains unclear if Saudi authorities are even willing to release the compensation, let alone adjust it for inflation as some family members now demand -  with some claiming it could be worth over $1bn today.  Followers of the case note the property was a waqf - an Islamic charitable endowment - meaning descendants can manage but not own it. The Saudi department that handles Awqaf (endowed properties) did not respond to the BBC's request for comment, and the government has made no public statement on the matter. That hasn't stopped speculation - about both the money and who it rightfully belongs to. Little is known about the guest house itself, but descendants claim it stood just steps from the Masjid al-Haram, with 22 rooms and several halls spread over 1.5 acres.  According to family lore, Keyi shipped wood from Malabar to build it and appointed a Malabari manager to run it - an ambitious gesture, though not unusual for the time.  Saudi Arabia was a relatively poor country back then - the discovery of its massive oil fields still a few decades away. The Hajj pilgrimage and the city's importance in Islam meant that Indian Muslims often donated money or built infrastructure for Indian pilgrims there. In his 2014 book, Mecca: The Sacred City, historian Ziauddin Sardar notes that during the second half of the 18th Century, the city had acquired a distinctively Indian character with its economy and financial well-being dependent on Indian Muslims. ""Almost 20% of the city's inhabitants, the largest single majority, were now of Indian origins – people from Gujarat, Punjab, Kashmir and Deccan, all collectively known locally as the Hindis,"" Sardar wrote. As Saudi Arabia's oil wealth surged in the 20th century, sweeping development projects reshaped Mecca. Keyi Rubath was demolished three times, the final time in the early 1970s. That's when the confusion around compensation appears to have started.  According to BM Jamal, former secretary of India's Central Waqf Council, the Indian consulate in Jeddah wrote to the government back then, seeking details of Mayankutty Keyi's legal heir.  ""In my understanding, authorities were looking for the descendants to appoint a manager for the property, not to distribute the compensation money,"" Mr Jamal said. Nonetheless, two factions stepped forward: the Keyis - Mayankutty's paternal family - and the Arakkals, a royal family from Kerala into which he had married.  Both families traditionally followed a matrilineal inheritance system -  a custom not recognized under Saudi law, adding further complexity. The Keyis claim that Mayankutty died childless, making his sister's children his rightful heirs under matrilineal tradition.  But the Arakkals claim he had a son and a daughter, and therefore, under Indian law, his children would be the legal inheritors. As the dispute dragged on, the story took on a life of its own. In 2011, after rumours swirled that the compensation could be worth millions, more than 2,500 people flooded a district office in Kannur, claiming to be Keyi's descendants. ""There were people who claimed that their forefathers had taught Mayankutty in his childhood. Others claimed that their forefathers had provided timber for the guest house,"" a senior Keyi family member, who wanted to stay anonymous, told the BBC. Scams followed. State officials say in 2017 fraudsters posing as Keyi descendants duped locals into handing over money, promising a share of the compensation.   Today, the case remains unresolved.  Some descendants propose the best way to end the dispute would be to ask the Saudi government to use the compensation money to build another guest house for Hajj pilgrims, as Myankutti Keyi had intended. But others reject this, arguing that the guest house was privately owned, and so any compensation rightfully belongs to the family. Some argue that even if the family proves lineage to Mayankutty Keyi, without ownership documents, they're unlikely to gain anything. For Muhammed Shihad, a Kannur resident who has co-authored a book on the history of the Keyi and Arakkal families, though, the dispute is not just about the money - but about honouring the family's roots.  ""If they don't get the compensation, it would be worth openly recognising the family's and the region's connection to this noble act."" Copyright 2025 BBC.

6/7/2025,Article,On board the driverless lorries hoping to transform China's transport industry,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5ykel5dr62o,"They rumble down the highway between Beijing and Tianjin port: big lorries, loaded up and fully able to navigate themselves. Sure, there is a safety driver in the seat, as per government regulations, but these lorries don't require them, and many analysts say it won't take long before they are gone. When ""safety driver"" Huo Kangtian, 32, first takes his hands off the wheel, and lets the lorry drive itself, it is somehow impressive and disconcerting in equal measures. For the initial stages of the journey, he is in full control. Then - at a certain point - he hits a few buttons, and the powerful, heavy machine is driving itself, moving at speed along a public road to Tianjin. ""Of course, I felt a bit scared the first time I drove an autonomous truck,"" says Mr Huo. ""But, after spending a lot of time observing and testing these machines, I think they are actually pretty good and safe."" As the lorry veers off the freeway and up a ramp towards the toll gates, the machine is still driving itself. On the other side of the tollgate, Mr Huo again presses a few buttons, and he is back in charge. ""My job as a safety driver is to act as the last line of defence. For example, in the case of an emergency, I would have to take back control of the vehicle immediately to ensure everyone's safety,""  he explains. In terms of the upsides for a driver, he says that switching to autonomous mode can help combat stress and fatigue, as well as freeing up hands and feet for other tasks. He says it doesn't make his job boring, but rather more interesting. When asked if he is worried that this technology may one day render his job obsolete, he says he doesn't know too much about this. It's the diplomatic answer. Pony AI's fleet of driverless lorries, currently operating on these test routes, is only the start of what is to come, the company's vice-president Li Hengyu tells the BBC. ""In the future, with driverless operations, our transportation efficiency will definitely be greatly improved,"" he says. ""For example, labour costs will be reduced but, more importantly, we can deal better with harsh environments and long hours driving."" What this all boils down to is saving money, says industry expert Yang Ruigang, a technology professor from Shanghai Jiaotong University, who has extensive experience working on driverless technology in both China and the US. ""Anything that can reduce operating costs is something a company would like to have, so it's fairly easy to justify the investment in having a fully autonomous, driverless truck,"" he tells the BBC. In short, he says, the goal is simple: ""Reduce the driver cost close to zero."" However, significant hurdles remain before lorries will be allowed to drive themselves on roads around the world - not the least of which is public concern. In China, self-driving technology suffered a major setback following an accident which killed three university students after their vehicle had been in ""auto pilot"" mode. Economist Intelligence Unit analyst Chim Lee says the Chinese public still has quite a way to go before it is won over. ""We know that recent accidents involving passenger cars have caused a huge uproar in China. So, for driverless trucks – even though they tend to be more specific to certain locations for the time being – the public's image of them is going to be absolutely critical for policy makers, and for the market as well, compared to passenger vehicles."" Professor Yang agrees that lorry drivers are unlikely to lose their jobs in large numbers just yet. ""We have to discuss the context. Open environment? Probably not. High speed? Definitely no. But, if it is a low-speed situation, like with the last mile delivery trucks, it's here already."" In Eastern China's Anhui Province, hundreds of driverless delivery vans navigate their way through the suburban streets of Hefei - a city with an official population of eight million - as human-driven scooters and cars whizz around them. It was once one of country's poorest cities, but these days its government wants it to be known as a place of the future, prepared to give new technology a chance. Gary Huang, president of autonomous vehicle company, Rino.ai, says they discovered a market niche where driverless delivery vans could send parcels from big distribution hubs run by courier companies to local neighbourhood stations. At that point, scooter drivers take over, dropping off the packages to people's front doors. ""We're allowing couriers to stay within community areas to do pickup and drop off while the autonomous vans handle the repetitive, longer-distance trips. This boosts the entire system's efficiency,"" he tells us. Rino has also been talking to other countries, and the company says the quickest uptake of its vehicles will be in Australia later this year, when a supermarket chain will start using their driverless delivery vehicles. Meanwhile, in China, they say they're now running more than 500 vans with road access in over 50 cities. However, Hefei remains the most advanced. Apart from Rino, the city has also now given permission for other driverless delivery van companies to operate. Gary Huang says this is due to a combination of factors. ""Encouragement came from the government, followed by local experimentation, the gaining of experience, the refinement of regulations and eventually allowing a broad implementation."" And you can see them on the roads, changing lanes, indicating before they turn, pulling up at red lights and avoiding other traffic. For the courier companies, the numbers tell the story. According to Rino's regional director for Anhui Province, Zhang Qichen, deliveries are not only faster, but companies can hire three autonomous electric delivery vans which will run for days without needing a charge for the same cost as one driver. She says she has been blown away by the pace of change in her industry and adds that she would not be surprised if heavy, long-haul lorries are routinely driving themselves on roads in certain circumstances within five years. Professor Yang agrees. ""Heavy trucks running along a highway unrestricted, at least five years away."" When asked if it could really happen so soon, he responds: ""I'm pretty sure it will happen. In fact, I'm confident that it will happen."" Industry insiders say that the most immediate applications for driverless lorries – apart from in enclosed industrial zones likes open-cut mines or ports – are probably in remote, harsh terrain with extreme environmental conditions, especially along vast stretches and in a largely straight trajectory. Significant technical challenges do remain though. Heavy lorries need better cameras to track well ahead into distance to detect hazards much further down the road, in the same way a person can; more tricky roads may also need to have extra sensors placed along the route; other hurdles could include breakdowns in extreme weather or sudden, unexpected dangers emerging amidst very busy traffic. On top of all this, the technology – when it comes to heavy lorries – is still not cheap. What's more, these vehicles are right now modified old style lorries rather than self-driving vehicles straight off the production line. China wants to be a champion of new tech, but it also has to be careful, not only because of the potential for deadly accidents but also because of how Chinese people might view this shift. ""This is not just about fulfilling regulations. It is not just about building a public image,"" says Chim Lee. ""But that, over time, the public will see the benefit of this technology, see how it will reduce their costs for buying things, or look at it as a way of imagining that society is improving, rather than viewing this as technology which is potentially destroying, causing car accidents or removing employment opportunities."" Professor Yang sees another problem. ""We humans can tolerate another human driver making mistakes but our tolerance for autonomous trucks is much much lower. Machines are not supposed to make mistakes. So, we have to make sure that the system is extremely reliable."" Copyright 2025 BBC.

6/7/2025,Article,"Cosey Fanni Tutti reflects on journey through art, porn and music",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2k113yywzo,"It is fitting that we meet a woman once described as a ""wrecker of civilisation"" in the grounds of a ruined priory.  Cosey Fanni Tutti, a founding member of the influential band Throbbing Gristle and radical performance artist, was given the title by Conservative MP Sir Nicholas Fairbairn in 1976 after an art exhibition, Prostitution, led to a tabloid furore and a House of Commons debate. Prostitution, created by Tutti and her colleagues at the collective COUM Transmissions, showed at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London and included pornographic images of her alongside used bandages and tampons. ""It has taken 50 years for [the exhibition] to be revisited and understood for what it was really trying to say,"" says the 73-year-old who lives near King's Lynn, Norfolk. Tutti modelled for pornographic magazines in her work as a performance artist and pages from these publications featured in Prostitution, but were hidden away in a back room. She says she ""infiltrated"" the porn industry to turn the tables on the consumers of these magazines and subvert the male gaze - the watcher now being watched. ""It's my point of view. It was my action,"" she says in the grounds of Castle Acre Priory, Norfolk.  She wanted the exhibition to ""bring [porn] into a different kind of viewpoint and interpretation"" and to ""empower women to think that [the porn industry] is something we have to discuss, regarding how you think of it, as either subverting it or going along [with it]"". The porn industry in the 1970s involved ""some of the most unlikely people"", she says.  ""I won't say who they are, but they were well known at the time. Famous names."" Exhibits from Prostitution are now on display at the Maxwell Graham Gallery in New York City until 28 June, which coincides with the release of her new album 2T2.  ""I haven't been to see the exhibition because of the situation in America. I've no desire to go to America at the moment,"" she says. Throbbing Gristle produced extraordinary - sometimes terrifying - music and are regarded as founders of the genre known as industrial, named after the record label they founded. Active between 1975 and 1981, and again between 2004 and 2010, they have influenced acts including Soft Cell, Nine Inch Nails and Ministry. Today, Tutti shares a converted chapel with her partner, frequent collaborator and former bandmate, Chris Carter.  The couple left London with their son in the early 1980s and bought the chapel at auction after spotting it in a local newspaper.  They had previously been living in squats, a culture that has declined to Tutti's regret. ""It's not just the people that want to live an alternative lifestyle and be creative and do music and art and so on, but it's also just impacting people that just want to live, have a family, just work and have a decent life,"" she says. ""What do you do when you can't afford the rent?""  The musicians now have a home studio where her new album was recorded. She says 2T2 is infused with emotion; bereavement and illness informing tracks such as Stound, with its beats and spectral chanting.  ""The last five years have been really difficult. I mean, personally, through illness and loss,"" she says. Carter became seriously unwell with Covid which ""refocused our world completely"", she says, ""and then I got ill with something else, which was indirectly related to Covid"". Carter built some of the first sampling machines for the band to use, years before the technology became mainstream.  On 2T2 ""there's some tracks on that that express that anger I felt about what had happened to [Carter and I] and to the world, actually"", she says. ""It's a war zone isn't it?"" As she speaks, roaring jet fighters from a nearby airbase circle low overhead. Following the publication of her memoir Art Sex Music in 2017, a documentary about Tutti's life is now in the works. It will be directed by Caroline Catz , with whom she previously collaborated on the film Delia Derbyshire: The Myths and Legendary Tapes. Derbyshire was a British electronic music pioneer who only belatedly received acclaim and acknowledgement after her death, such as for her arrangement of the Dr Who theme.  Sexism was the reason, says Tutti, that ""she wasn't given the credit for what she had done"".  ""A bit like me with the Throbbing Gristle records, actually."" It was this identification with Derbyshire that led Tutti to write Re-Sisters in 2002, which also focused on another non-conformist woman, the medieval Norfolk mystic Margery Kempe.  Tutti says Kempe's story left her ""gobsmacked"".  ""A woman from the 1300s who was resisting everything that was expected of a woman back then, and the more I looked into her, the more relevant her story was to both me and Delia."" Gardening and reading is how this provocateur prefers to spend her time these days. After giving up touring, the pioneer of avant-garde noise and electronica now enjoys the Norfolk countryside.  ""I like peace and quiet,"" she says. Cosey Fanni Tutti's album, 2T2, will be released by Conspiracy International on 13 June Follow Norfolk news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.

6/7/2025,Article,Secret Glastonbury: The mystery of the festival's surprise stars,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg5zd3nkkwo,"After the full Glastonbury timetable was published this week, one band's name was on everybody's lips. Except no-one knows who they actually are. Patchwork have a prime place on the festival's line-up - third from the top of the bill on the main Pyramid Stage on the Saturday night. The only thing is, there's no band called Patchwork. It's a fake name for a mystery guest - just as an unknown band called The ChurnUps were on the Pyramid bill in 2023, and turned out to be the Foo Fighters. Fans immediately went into overdrive to try to work out Patchwork's identity - part of the frenzied guessing game surrounding the festival's ""surprise"" sets. The main theories include: In conclusion: I don't know. ""Radiohead also are in the mix of rumours because they've been teasing some tour action,"" suggests music journalist and broadcaster Georgie Rogers, who was a judge for Glastonbury's emerging talent competition this year and is DJing at the festival. ""Or could Elton John be returning to do something with Brandi Carlile?""  Sir Elton headlined in 2023, and Carlile, his collaborator on his last album, is on the Pyramid Stage bill on the same day as Patchwork. The Patchwork slot is just one of several tantalising gaps in this year's schedule. Another mystery Pyramid performer is listed as ""TBA"" for Friday afternoon, while the smaller Park and Woodsies stages - which have hosted secret sets by big names in the past - each have an empty space on the line-up. ""They're quite prominent sets, and they do tend to put in massive artists,"" says Rogers. One group of fans think they know who will fill those gaps. ""Of the four main slots, I think we've got three of them, maybe four, nailed down,"" says Ad, one of the people behind the Secretglasto social media account. ""I think it's definitely people who have got relationships with the festival who will be doing the big slots. An emotional return for one or two, I think. Some unfinished business."" Ad doesn't say any more, but that could point to Lewis Capaldi, who struggled to finish his set in 2023 before announcing a break from touring to get his ""mental and physical health in order"". He made a tentative comeback last month, and would be a popular choice. Lana Del Rey also has unfinished business - her 2023 set was cut short after she breached the curfew. She's back on tour in the UK, with free days on the Friday and Sunday of Glastonbury weekend. Other stars who have been rumoured include Lady Gaga, who hasn't played Glastonbury since 2009. Asked earlier this year what it would take for her to return to the festival, she replied: ""Not much"". Gaga has already played Coachella and been on tour this year. Lorde isn't on the bill either, but told BBC Radio 2's Jo Whiley this week she's ""pretty keen"" to be. ""The album's gonna be coming out right around that time,"" she said. ""I am quite tempted by what's going on because I've got lots of friends playing as well. We'll see if I can pull some strings and get there."" The Secretglasto team have gathered and posted information about surprise sets for more than a decade, and interest in their tips has gone ""a bit crazy"" in recent years. Ad - who doesn't want to give his full name - says they have built up a network of reliable sources. ""We've got loads of contacts at different stages and record labels and whatever else. And people trust us to be sensible with the information,"" he says. ""And the bands themselves don't want empty secret sets do they? So we have had occasions where they have come to us."" The six people who work on the account aren't music industry insiders themselves. Another team member, JB, says they sometimes approach acts directly to seek confirmation. ""Now that we've been around for 10 years and have a decent bit of clout, we will contact some of the artists via their inboxes, and quite often they're happy to confirm. ""Sometimes they don't. Sometimes they block us. But generally we're able to piece all that together fairly quickly."" He adds: ""By the time the gates open, there aren't many things we don't know."" In the past couple of years, some acts have begun harnessing the buzz about secret sets for PR purposes for their album or tour, Ad believes. ""It used to just be friends of the festival, whereas now people are like, 'If we do the secret set we're going to get loads of hype and media attention'."" Ad was among the lucky few to see Lady Gaga play an after-hours set in Club Dada following her main appearance as her career was taking off in 2009. ""She did three or four hits and then disappeared,"" he recalls. ""Because the phone signal was so bad, you couldn't ring or text your mate to let them know. So only the people who happened to be there got to experience it, which was a few hundred. ""I'm surprised she hasn't come back. Yet."" That was one of the more exclusive secret sets in Glastonbury history. Others draw huge crowds when the word gets out - which it usually does. Rogers was in the right place when a rumour swept the site that Radiohead would play in 2011. ""We were over that side of the festival anyway, so on a wing and a prayer, just in case it was true, we dashed over to the Park Stage in good time, and we got pretty close to the stage,"" she says. ""There are reports that it was the biggest crowd on the Park Stage for a secret set ever. I'd waited my whole life to see Radiohead live, and then suddenly here we are, and they did this amazing set. ""As my first ever time seeing them, and being in prime position, and it being a genuine surprise - it was just pure glee. I was just so happy, and I couldn't believe it."" Secret sets have been a feature of the festival for decades. In 1992, the line-up poster wasn't topped by a star name but the promise of ""a special guest that we can't announce"". That turned out to be Welsh pop stallion Tom Jones. But Glastonbury's greatest ever secret set didn't happen at the festival at all. In 1995, indie gods The Stone Roses pulled out of headlining after guitarist John Squire broke his collarbone. But by the time organiser Michael Eavis threw his annual low-key autumn gig in the local village to thank residents for putting up with the main event, Squire was back in action. So the band made an unannounced live comeback after a five-year absence in a marquee on a Somerset playing field to a couple of thousand lucky people. They still haven't appeared at the festival itself, however. Unfinished business? Tick. Emotional return? Tick! Could Patchwork in fact be The Stone Roses making a long-awaited and triumphant appearance? Who cares if the likelihood rating is -100/10. Add them to the list! Copyright 2025 BBC.

6/7/2025,Article,Police search for Washington man accused of killing his 3 daughters,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czdyeld2m2yo,"Police are still looking for a Washington man they believe murdered his three young daughters one week ago. Travis Decker, 32, is wanted on kidnapping and first-degree murder charges for killing his daughters, aged nine, eight and five, according to the Wenatchee Police Department in Washington state. Officials believe Mr Decker, who they say is an outdoorsman and may have gone to mountain survival school as part of his military training, is hiding in a remote part of the mountainous and wooded state, making the search for him difficult.  He has been said to ""pose a significant risk, if approached"". Police have not provided a possible motive.  The girls - Paityn, Evelyn and Olivia - died from apparent suffocation in a remote campground earlier this week, according to police.  Their mother reported them missing on 30 May, after Mr Decker failed to return his daughters to her following a visit. He also did not take her phone calls.  A few days later, on 2 June, police found the girls' bodies near the campground.  Police also found Mr Decker's cell phone at the campground, but he was no longer there. His truck, which he was believed to have been living in, was also found nearby. ""I don't think any motive would be acceptable. And clearly it's not the decision of a sound mind,"" Chelan County Sheriff Mike Morrison said at a press conference on Wednesday, where he made a public plea to Mr Decker to turn himself in. Mr Decker's outdoor survival skills may be helping him evade the authorities searching for him, which includes the FBI, Sheriff Morrison said.  ""It sounds like at times he would go out and would be off-grid for sometimes up to two and a half months,"" Sheriff Morrison said after speaking to Mr Decker's family. Mr Decker may have scoped out the area and hidden supplies there before allegedly killing his children, and he has ""the knowledge to survive for a long period of time"", the sheriff added. ""We want a peaceful resolution to this, but we're not going to relinquish our efforts,"" Sheriff Morrison said while asking Mr Decker to come forward. ""Let's wrap this up and do what's right for your kids."" The US Marshals Service on Wednesday announced a $20,000 (£14,780) reward for information leading to Mr Decker's capture. The search has caused widespread closures of national forests popular among hikers in the area.    Copyright 2025 BBC.

6/7/2025,Article,My son is one of just 16 who has a condition with no name,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp3qpv00dk5o,"Jack is one of only 16 children in the world with a life-limiting genetic condition that is so rare it doesn't have a name. The 11-month-old has a mutation of the PPFIBP1 gene which means he is blind, has frequent seizures and is unlikely to ever walk or talk. His mum and dad want to track down the parents of the other children with his condition to better understand their son's diagnosis and offer support. ""It is very limited with what they can tell us,"" said his mum Amanda Thomas from St Athan, Vale of Glamorgan.   ""But what they have said is it is life-limiting and it is likely that he will pass away at some point during childhood but they don't know when that will be.""  To date Amanda has spoken to one other parent, a woman from Georgia in the US, whose daughter had the condition and died at the age of two. ""She felt so blessed to have her little girl in her life, even for a short time and you could just see how much love was there,"" said Amanda. She said being able to ask one another questions was helpful for both of them and she was left overwhelmed by the experience.  For the first few weeks of his life, Amanda and Nick's fourth child Jack appeared completely healthy.  He was nine weeks old when they first spotted something that caused concern. ""His right eye had dropped to the outside and it had fixed but his head had stuck to the side as well,"" explained Amanda. ""Nick took one look at him and said 'I think he needs to go into A&E'."" Initially doctors were not overly concerned and the family returned home. Just hours later the same thing happened again only this time Jack was also lethargic and his breathing had become shallow so he was taken to hospital by ambulance.  Shortly after arriving he had his first seizure. ""He stopped breathing, I shouted for help and an entire crash team came in,"" said Amanda. ""They resuscitated him and then on the way to taking him to resus they had to stop in the corridor and resuscitate him again."" Jack was put on a ventilator and moved into intensive care. Doctors were at a loss as to what was wrong with him.  Following a number of tests that led nowhere the family underwent genetic testing. The results showed Jack has a mutated PPFIBP1 gene. ""They explained that every gene has two copies and with this particular gene I carry one mutated copy and Nick carries another mutated copy,"" said Amanda. ""It's meant that both of Jack's copies of this gene have got a variation to it which has caused this neurodevelopmental disorder which doesn't have a name because it is so rare."" With so few known cases it is hard for doctors to predict Jack's life expectancy.  ""They've said it could be when he's one, it could be when he's five, it could be 10 years but knowing that we're going to outlive our child and knowing that his brothers and his sister may one day have to say goodbye to him is heart-breaking,"" said Amanda.  Amanda and Nick were told their other children - aged 10, eight and 4 - also had a 25% chance of having the mutated gene but tests showed this was not the case.  When Jack first became unwell last September the family were in the middle of fully renovating their house. Everything came to a standstill so the family home is a partial building site.   Amanda has left her job in social services to take care of Jack full-time and Nick has been able to continue working but is recovering from a stroke in July 2023 and heart surgery that followed in May last year. They are trying to crowdfund the renovation as well as equipment for Jack. ""Life is testing,"" admitted Nick.  ""Amanda and I have to be realistic this could be his last Christmas, this could be his last birthday so really we're just trying to get this as comfortable as possible so Jack enjoys the time he does have with us.  He said he and Amanda found strength in one another.  Alongside all of this Amanda is continuing her search for other parents of children with Jack's condition.  ""When we had our diagnosis we had nobody to turn to because there was nobody who had the same condition so there's no support groups available, there's nothing,"" said Amanda. ""If somebody in the future gets this diagnosis then perhaps they can find me, and I can offer a bit of support that I didn't have in the beginning because there were so many questions, so many what ifs, where, how, which were all just being met with 'we don't know'."" Over the past eight months Jack has been taken to hospital by air ambulance three times and the family have spent about 60 nights in hospital. With the future so uncertain the family are making the most of every moment. ""I just used to stress about the things that didn't matter, my house not being tidy, the washing piling up, now I'm learning that's not important anymore,"" said Amanda. ""We really do have limited time with Jack so it's about having those moments and making the most of it."" Copyright 2025 BBC.

6/7/2025,Article,MI5 misled watchdog about neo-Nazi spy case,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0572v3j7dvo,"The watchdog charged with holding MI5 to account rewrote a report into the handling of a violent neo-Nazi agent after the Security Service gave it false information, the BBC can reveal. An early draft of the report by the Investigatory Powers Commissioner's Office (IPCO) contradicted false evidence given by MI5 to court, but the final version did not. IPCO told the BBC it was ""misled"" by the Security Service. MI5 director general Sir Ken McCallum apologised to IPCO, after the BBC challenged the Security Service's false statements to the courts. The revelation means that MI5 has effectively given false evidence in this case to every organisation or court which is supposed to have access to the Security Service's secrets and is responsible for holding it to account. It also raises questions about how easily IPCO accepts false assurances from MI5, when it is supposed to ensure the Security Service works within the law and in the public interest. IPCO began its secret investigation into MI5's handling of the agent - a genuine neo-Nazi known publicly as X who informed on extremist networks – in 2022. It was prompted by a BBC story about how X used his Security Service role to coerce and terrorise his then-girlfriend, known publicly as ""Beth"". MI5 had told me he was an agent in 2020 while trying to stop me running a news story about the man's extremism. I had already heard he was an agent, also known as a covert human intelligence source (Chis), and told MI5 as much. The calls were an attempt by MI5 to protect and cover for X, a violent misogynistic abuser with paedophilic tendencies. Telling me he was an agent was inconsistent with MI5's public claims about always abiding by a core secrecy policy – known as neither confirm nor deny (NCND) – on the status of agents. But the Security Service maintained it had stuck by the NCND policy - first in a court case where the government tried to prevent the BBC from publishing a story about X, and then in two further courts where Beth made a claim against MI5. Keeping X's status officially secret meant that key evidence was withheld from Beth. IPCO's role is to inspect the use of investigatory powers by MI5, such as its use of agents, and to identify any concerns in its reports. It reviewed MI5 documents about the case of agent X,  including an official record authorising a departure from NCND, and sent a draft report to MI5 in February 2023. The report concluded that MI5 had taken the ""extraordinary"" decision to depart from NCND on X's agent status in calls with me. But MI5 pushed back and denied it had departed from the policy, including in correspondence with the Investigatory Powers Commissioner himself Sir Brian Leveson, a retired Court of Appeal judge best known for chairing a public inquiry into the culture and standards of the media. MI5 told IPCO: ""We would like to make clear that we did not in fact take any such decision. [X's] status was not disclosed to the BBC either at that time or subsequently."" In December 2023 Sir Brian wrote back, saying that ""based on the records available"" it was ""entitled to conclude as a justifiable inference, on the balance of probabilities, that MI5 disclosed [X's] role as a CHIS"". He said that MI5 had provided no documentary evidence to support its position, nor any explanation about how it had convinced me not to run a story about X, as the Security Service had claimed. ""I note that MI5 has not disputed that disclosure was, at least, contemplated… either there was inadequate record keeping or there has been a failure to make records available to inspectors. Either would represent a serious compliance failure,"" he said. MI5 refused to back down and IPCO changed its position, with the final report falsely saying that there was no departure from NCND. The final version introduced three significant falsehoods. First, the report said that ""an operational plan was agreed that there would be no disclosure that X was an MI5 CHIS"". This was the opposite of the truth. MI5's entire operational plan involved a sustained attempt to persuade me to stop doing a story by disclosing that X was an agent. Second, the report said ""it was not MI5 policy to record all such exchanges"" with journalists. This was untrue. There was a policy requiring such exchanges to be recorded. Third, the report referenced a High Court witness statement I had given and said: ""De Simone's witness statement confirms that no disclosure of X's status as a CHIS was made."" This was false. My witness statement said no such thing. When contacted by the BBC, IPCO said it was ""misled into amending our draft report to remove the finding that Agent X's status had been disclosed."" IPCO said the first two falsehoods were included due to ""assurances provided by MI5"" and that it is now ""clear that this information was incorrect and that the findings in our draft report reflected the true position"". Regarding the false information about my witness statement, IPCO said: ""We accept that this line in the report reflects our interpretation of your statement based on the information available to us at the time.""  The BBC challenged MI5 on its false evidence late last year, leading to the Security Service apologising in the High Court. MI5 promised to transparently investigate what happened, and produced new witness statements from the senior officer in charge of the MI5 team who handled X and MI5's director general of strategy - who is in effect third-in-command of the Security Service. But neither of them told the court about the IPCO reports, even in the closed, secret part of the case intended to allow MI5 to disclose sensitive evidence. The judge, Mr Justice Chamberlain, only learned about the IPCO report after he had made MI5 hand over another secret document which mentioned it. MI5 made further witness statements apologising to the court, with the senior officer in charge of the team who handled X saying that ""on reflection"" they recognised the ""IPCO issue"" should have been revealed earlier. ""I apologise for not recognising the importance of explaining the IPCO aspect,"" the director general of strategy said, but he insisted there had been no ""attempt to conceal or obscure that aspect of the background"". The BBC was only told about the IPCO issue last week, with further information then provided after MI5 abandoned an attempt to keep applying its NCND secrecy policy on X's agent status. Following a High Court hearing on Tuesday, a panel of senior judges is considering what to do next about MI5's false evidence. MI5's internal review into the false evidence said it was a result of mistakes, poor memories and bad record-keeping. The BBC said there is evidence of lies by MI5 officers, the internal inquiry was lacklustre and MI5 tried to keep damning material from the court. IPCO said its investigation of how MI5 had managed Agent X found a ""critical failure to create and maintain accurate documentary records; a finding which was reinforced in the final report due to MI5's inability to produce any contemporaneous records and the length of time taken to respond to our requests for supporting evidence"". In IPCO's most recent annual report, published in the past few days, Sir Brian referred to Agent X, saying: ""Recent developments in this case mean that we are keeping it under review.""

6/8/2025,Article,Trump's intervention in LA is a political fight he is eager to have,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/c628vwq9z9zo,"On the campaign trail last year, Donald Trump promised that he was not going to tolerate left-wing lawlessness on American streets and would use the full force of his presidential powers in response. The protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) efforts in California on Saturday night gave him an opening to follow through on that promise.  Never mind that the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) said that the protests were largely peaceful, or that local authorities said they could handle the clashes that did turn violent. Trump administration officials said that immigration agents were being targeted and injured – and that local law enforcement had been too slow to respond. ""Waiting several hours for LAPD to show up - or them telling us that they're not going to back us up until they have an officer in a dangerous situation - is something that just isn't workable when you have violent protests going on,"" Homeland Security Secretary Kirsty Noem told CBS News on Sunday morning. The LAPD said it ""acted as swiftly as conditions safely allowed"" and began dispersing crowds within 55 minutes of receiving the call. Over California Governor Gavin Newsom's objection, Trump federalised the 2,000 California National Guard soldiers, and Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth warned that US Marines were also on ""high alert"" to deploy – which would mark a rare use of the active duty military on US soil. By Sunday morning, Trump was declaring victory and thanking the National Guard for restoring peace, even though the guard had yet to fully assemble. The speed with which Trump reacted suggests that this is a fight his administration is prepared for – and even eager to have.  The White House believes that law and order, and aggressive immigration enforcement, are winning issues for him.  His actions will thrill his core base of supporters and could sway political independents concerned about public safety. Noem, in her interview, said the Black Lives Matters protests of 2020 in Minnesota were allowed to spread unchecked – and that the new Trump administration was going to handle things differently. ""We're not going to let a repeat of 2020 happen,"" she said. Democrats, however, have said the administration's use of masked immigration officers with military gear to arrest civilians in restaurants and shops has been inflammatory, and that the president's eagerness to deploy trained soldiers was unwarranted. ""For the president to do this when it wasn't requested, breaking with generations of tradition, is only going to incite the situation and make things worse,"" said New Jersey Senator Cory Booker.  ""A lot of these peaceful protests are being generated because the president of the United States is sowing chaos and confusion by arresting people who are showing up for their immigration hearings, who are trying to abide by the law."" The US has a long tradition of summer protests, and it is only early June.  Five months into Trump's second term, these California demonstrations may be an isolated event – or the start of greater civil unrest in the days ahead. Copyright 2025 BBC.

6/8/2025,Article,Israel says Hamas Gaza chief Sinwar's body identified,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/c62veqrq3yzo,"The Israeli military has said it has located and identified the body of Mohammed Sinwar, the military leader of Palestinian armed group Hamas in Gaza. His body was discovered in a tunnel underneath the European Hospital in the southern city of Khan Younis, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said on Sunday.  It said it had verified the body's identity through DNA checks - though Hamas has not publicly confirmed his death. Sinwar, 49, was killed in an air strike on 13 May, which the Hamas-run civil defence agency said killed 28 people and injured dozens. Sinwar's body was found alongside that of Mohammad Sabaneh, the commander of Hamas's Rafah Brigade, the IDF said. It added that ""several items belonging to Sinwar and Sabaneh were located, along with additional intelligence findings that were transferred for further investigation"". The IDF said other bodies were found, which it was looking to identify.  It took a small group of foreign journalists into Gaza to Khan Younis to show them the tunnel on Sunday. It also published video of the small entrance to the tunnel, accessible through freshly dug earth just in front of the European Hospital.  The footage shows a long, narrow underground corridor that leads to several rooms. Inside some of them, piles of clothes and plastic chairs are visible, with a rifle leaning up against the wall. One video also shows a shrouded body being pulled from the tunnel by a rope. IDF spokesperson Brig Gen Effie Defrin said that in one of the rooms they found the Sinwar's body.   ""This is another example of the cynical use by Hamas, using civilians as human shields, using civilian infrastructure, hospitals, again and again,"" he said. Israel has repeatedly accused Hamas of using hospitals as hiding places for weapons and command centres, which the group denies. The IDF has mounted sieges and attacks on hospitals in Gaza, or ordered their evacuation, leaving the territory's health system on the verge of total collapse. Such attacks have caused widespread international concern, as many hospitals and medical facilities have been put out of action - and the lives of patients and staff put at risk. In a statement after an Israeli strike on al-Ahli hospital in April, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres expressed his deep alarm and declared that, under international humanitarian law, the ""wounded and sick, medical personnel and medical facilities, including hospitals, must be respected and protected"". Hospital staff in Gaza have also repeatedly denied that Hamas is using their facilities as a base. The IDF will point to this latest footage as vindication of its claims and its military strategy. As with so much in Gaza, however, full independent verification is not possible. Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza in response to the unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023 , in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. At least 54,880 people have been killed in Gaza since, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. The renewed fighting in Gaza comes following the collapse of a ceasefire and hostage exchange deal a few months ago. Since then, Israel has restated its aim to destroy Hamas and recover the hostages, of whom 54 remain in captivity and 23 are thought to still be alive. Mohammed Sinwar joined Hamas shortly after its founding in the late 1980s and became a member of the group's military wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades. He rose through the ranks and by 2005 he was commander of the Khan Younis Brigade. Sinwar was also reported to have been close to another of Hamas's previous military chiefs, Mohammed Deif, and had been involved in the planning of the 7 October attack. His brother and predecessor, Yahya Sinwar - believed to be the one of the masterminds behind the 7 October attack - was killed by Israeli troops last October. Copyright 2025 BBC.

6/8/2025,Article,"Israeli troops board aid ship bound for Gaza, activists say",https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/c5y264x3nnno,"Activists say Israeli troops have boarded a yacht trying to bring humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip, in defiance of an Israeli naval blockade. ""Connection has been lost"" on the Madleen, the Freedom Flotilla Coalition (FFC) campaign group said on the Telegram app. It posted a photo showing people in life jackets sitting with their hands up.  Appearing to confirm that the ship had been boarded, Israel's foreign ministry said the yacht was ""safely making its way to the shores of Israel"" and its passengers were ""expected to return to their home countries"".  Climate activist Greta Thunberg is among those aboard the vessel, which was reported to be off the Egyptain coast.  Israel says its blockade is necessary to prevent weapons from reaching Hamas militants in Gaza.  After reporting that the yacht had been boarded, the FFC posted short, pre-recorded videos of some of the activists, including Thunberg.  In the footage, activists say ""if you see this video, we have been intercepted and kidnapped"" by the Israeli military or forces supporting Israel.  The FFC earlier said the vessel, which left Italy's island of Sicily on Friday, was carrying humanitarian aid and had been ""prepared for the possibility of an Israeli attack"". Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz had warned that the yacht should turn back and that Israel would act against any attempt to breach the blockade. He wrote in a post on X on Sunday: ""I have instructed the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] to act to prevent the 'Madeleine' [sic] hate flotilla from reaching the shores of Gaza - and to take whatever measures are necessary to that end."" Katz says the purpose of Israel's blockade, which has been in place since 2007, is to ""prevent the transfer of weapons to Hamas"" and is essential to Israel's security as it seeks to destroy Hamas.  The FFC has argued that the sea blockade is illegal, characterising Katz's statement as an example of Israel threatening the unlawful use of force against civilians and ""attempting to justify that violence with smears"". ""We will not be intimidated. The world is watching,"" FFC press officer Hay Sha Wiya said. ""The Madleen is a civilian vessel, unarmed and sailing in international waters, carrying humanitarian aid and human rights defenders from across the globe... Israel has no right to obstruct our effort to reach Gaza."" The Madleen is carrying a symbolic quantity of aid, including rice and baby formula, the group said. Citizens of Brazil, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and Turkey are onboard. In 2010, Israeli commandos killed 10 people when they boarded Turkish ship Mavi Marmara that was leading an aid flotilla towards Gaza. Israel recently began to allow limited aid into Gaza after a three-month land blockade, prioritising distribution through the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which is backed by Israel and the US but widely condemned by humanitarian groups. The UN's human rights chief, Volker Türk, said last week Palestinians were being presented with the ""grimmest of choices: die from starvation or risk being killed while trying to access the meagre food that is being made available"". But in a post on X early on Monday, the Israeli foreign ministry said: ""While Greta and others attempted to stage a media provocation whose sole purpose was to gain publicity - and which included less than a single truckload of aid - more than 1,200 aid trucks have entered Gaza from Israel within the past two weeks, and in addition, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation has distributed close to 11 million meals directly to civilians in Gaza. ""There are ways to deliver aid to the Gaza Strip - they do not involve Instagram selfies."" It is almost 20 months since Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza in response to the unprecedented Hamas-led cross-border attack on Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. At least 54,880 people have been killed in Gaza since, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Copyright 2025 BBC.

6/8/2025,Article,Bowen: Israel is accused of the gravest war crimes - how governments respond could haunt them for years,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/c0r1xl5wgnko,"Even wars have rules. They don't stop soldiers killing each other but they're intended to make sure that civilians caught up in the fighting are treated humanely and protected from as much danger as possible. The rules apply equally to all sides. If one side has suffered a brutal surprise attack that killed hundreds of civilians, as Israel did on 7 October 2023, it does not get an exemption from the law. The protection of civilians is a legal requirement in a battle plan. That, at least, is the theory behind the Geneva Conventions. The latest version, the fourth, was formulated and adopted after World War Two to stop such slaughter and cruelty to civilians from ever happening again. At the headquarters of the International Committee of the Red Cross in Geneva (ICRC) the words ""Even Wars Have Rules"" are emblazoned in huge letters on a glass rotunda.  The reminder is timely because the rules are being broken. Getting information from Gaza is difficult. It is a lethal warzone. At least 181 journalists and media workers have been killed since the war started, almost all Palestinians in Gaza, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. Israel won't let international news teams into Gaza. Since the best way to check controversial and difficult stories is first hand, that means the fog of war, always hard to penetrate, is as thick as I have ever experienced in a lifetime of war reporting. It is clear that Israel wants it to be that way. A few days into the war I was part of a convoy of journalists escorted by the army into the border communities that Hamas had attacked, while rescue workers were recovering the bodies of Israelis from smoking ruins of their homes, and Israeli paratroopers were still clearing buildings with bursts of gunfire. Israel wanted us to see what Hamas had done. The conclusion has to be that it does not want foreign reporters to see what it is doing in Gaza. To find an alternative route through that fog, we decided to approach it through the prism of laws that are supposed to regulate warfare and protect civilians. I went to the ICRC headquarters as it is the custodian of the Geneva Conventions.  I have also spoken to distinguished lawyers; to humanitarians with years of experience of working within the law to bring aid to Gaza and other warzones; and to senior Western diplomats about their governments' growing impatience with Israel and nervousness that they might be seen as complicit in future criminal investigations if they do not speak up about the catastrophe inside Gaza. In Europe there is also now a widely held belief, as in Israel, that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is prolonging the war not to safeguard Israelis, but to preserve the ultra-nationalist coalition that keeps him in power.  As prime minister he can prevent a national inquiry into his role in security failures that gave Hamas its opportunity before 7 October and slow down his long-running trial on serious corruption charges that could land him in jail. Netanyahu rarely gives interviews or news conferences. He prefers direct statements filmed and posted on social media. Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar declined a request for an interview.  Boaz Bismuth, a parliamentarian from Netanyahu's Likud party, repeated his leader's positions: that there is no famine in Gaza, that Israel respects the laws of war and that unwarranted criticism of its conduct by countries including the UK, France and Canada incites antisemitic attacks on Jews, including murder. Lawyers I have spoken to believe that there is evidence that Israel followed war crimes, committed by Hamas when it attacked Israel, with very many of its own, including the crime of genocide. It is clear that Israel has hard questions to answer that will not go away.  It also faces a legal process alleging genocide at the International Court of Justice and has a prime minister with limited travel options as he faces a warrant for arrest on war crimes charges issued by the International Criminal Court (ICC). Rival politicians inside Israel accuse Netanyahu of presiding over war crimes and turning Israel into a pariah state.  He has pushed back hard, comparing himself - when the warrant was issued - to Alfred Dreyfus, the Jewish officer wrongly convicted of treason in an antisemitic scandal that rocked France in the 1890s. The evidence of what is happening in Gaza starts with the numbers. On 7 October 2023 Hamas broke into Israel, killing 1,200 people. More than 800 were Israeli civilians. The others were members of Israel's security forces, first responders and foreign workers. Around 250 people, including non-Israelis, were dragged back into Gaza as hostages. Figures vary slightly, but it is believed that 54 hostages remain in Gaza, of whom 31 are believed to be dead. Collating the huge total of Palestinian casualties inside Gaza is much more difficult. Israel restricts movement inside Gaza and much of the north of the strip cannot be reached.  The latest figures from the ministry of health in Gaza record that Israel killed at least 54,607 Palestinians and wounded 125,341 between the 7 October attacks and 4 June this year. Its figures do not separate civilians from members of Hamas and other armed groups. According to Unicef, by January this year 14,500 Palestinian children in Gaza had been killed by Israel; 17,000 are separated from their parents or orphaned; and Gaza has the highest percentage of child amputees in the world. Israel and the US have tried to spread doubt about the casualty reports from the ministry, because like the rest of the fragments of governance left in Gaza, it is controlled by Hamas. But the ministry's figures are used by the UN, foreign diplomats and even, according to reports in Israel, the country's own intelligence services.  When the work of the ministry's statisticians was checked after previous wars, it tallied with other estimates. A study in medical journal The Lancet argues that the ministry underestimates the numbers killed by Israel, in part because its figures are incomplete. Thousands are buried under rubble of destroyed buildings and thousands more will die slowly of illnesses that would have been curable had they had access to medical care. Gaza's civilians had some respite during a ceasefire earlier this year. But when negotiations on a longer-term deal failed, Israel went back to war on 18 March with a series of huge air strikes and since then a new military offensive, which the prime minister says will finally deliver the elusive ""total victory"" over Hamas that he promised on 7 October 2023. Israel has put severe restrictions on food and aid shipments into Gaza throughout the war and blocked them entirely from March to May this year. With Gaza on the brink of famine, it is clear that Israel has violated laws that say civilians should be protected, not starved. A British government minister told the BBC that Israel was using hunger ""as a weapon of war"". The Israeli Defence Minister, Israel Katz, said openly that the food blockade was a ""main pressure lever"" against Hamas to release the hostages and accept defeat. Weaponising food is a war crime. War is always savage. I was in Geneva to see Mirjana Spoljaric, the Swiss diplomat who is president of the ICRC. She believes it can get even worse; that there is no doubt that both parties are flouting the Geneva Conventions, and this sends a message that the rules of war can be ignored in conflicts across the world. After we walked past glass cases displaying the ICRC's three Nobel peace prizes and handwritten copperplate reproductions of the Geneva Conventions, she warned that ""we are hollowing out the very rules that protect the fundamental rights of every human being"". We sat down to talk in a room with one of Europe's most serene views: the tranquillity of Lake Geneva and the magnificent sprawl of the Mont-Blanc massif.  But for Ms Spoljaric, constantly aware of the ICRC's role as custodian of the Geneva Conventions, the view beyond the Alps and across the Mediterranean to Gaza is alarming. She has been in Gaza twice since 7 October and says that it is worse than hell on earth. ""Humanity is failing in Gaza,"" Ms Spoljaric told me. ""It is failing. We cannot continue to watch what is happening. It's surpassing any acceptable, legal, moral, and humane standard. The level of destruction, the level of suffering."" More importantly, she says, the world is watching an entire people, the Palestinians, being stripped of their human dignity. ""It should really shock our collective conscience… It will haunt us. We are seeing things happening that will make the world an unhappier place far beyond the region."" I asked her about Israel's justification that it is acting in self-defence to destroy a terrorist organisation that attacked and killed its people on 7 October. ""It is no justification for a disrespect or for a hollowing out of the Geneva Conventions,"" she said. ""Neither party is allowed to break the rules, no matter what, and this is important because, look, the same rules apply to every human being under the Geneva Convention. ""A child in Gaza has exactly the same protections under the Geneva Conventions as a child in Israel."" Mirjana Spoljaric spoke quietly, with intense moral clarity. The ICRC considers itself a neutral organisation; in wars it tries to work even-handedly with all sides. She was not neutral about the rights all human beings should enjoy, and is deeply concerned that those rights are being damaged by the disregard of the rules of war in Gaza. On the evening of 7 October 2023, while Israel's troops were still fighting to drive Hamas invaders out of its border communities, Benjamin Netanyahu delivered a brief video address to the Israeli people and the watching world. Speaking from Israel's military command centre in the heart of Tel Aviv, he chose words that would reassure Israelis and induce dread in their enemies. They were also a window into his thinking about the way that the war should be fought, and how Israel would defend its military choices against criticism. The fate of Hamas was sealed, he promised. ""We will destroy them and we will forcefully avenge this dark day that they have forced on the State of Israel and its citizens. ""All of the places which Hamas is deployed, hiding and operating in, that wicked city, we will turn them into rubble."" Netanyahu praised allies who were rallying around Israel, singling out the US, France and the UK for their ""unreserved support"". He had spoken to them, he said, ""to ensure freedom of action"". But in war freedom of action has legal limits. States can fight, but it must be proportionate to the threat that they face, and civilian lives must be protected. ""You're never entitled to break the law,"" says Janina Dill, professor of global security at Oxford University's Blavatnik School. ""How Israel conducts this war is an entirely separate legal analysis… The same, by the way, is true in terms of resistance to occupation. October 7 was not an appropriate exercise [by Hamas] of the right of resistance to occupation either. ""So, you can have the overall right of self-defence or resistance. And then how you exercise that right is subject to separate rules. And having a really good cause in war legally doesn't give you additional licence to use additional violence. ""The rules on how wars are conducted are the rules for everybody regardless of why they are in the war."" What a difference time and death make in war. Twenty months after Netanyahu's speech, Israel has exhausted a deep reservoir of goodwill and support among many of its friends in Europe and Canada. Israel always had its critics and enemies. The difference now is that some countries and individuals who consider themselves friends and allies no longer support the way Israel has been fighting the war. In particular, the restrictions on food aid that respected international assessments say have brought Gaza to the brink of famine, as well as a growing stack of evidence of war crimes against Palestinian civilians. ""I'm shaken to my core,"" Jan Egeland, the veteran head of the Norwegian Refugee Council and former UN humanitarian chief, told me. ""I haven't seen a population like this being so trapped for such a long period of time in such a small, besieged area. Indiscriminate bombardment, denied journalism, denied healthcare. ""It is only comparable to the besieged areas of Syria during the Assad regime, which led to a uniform Western condemnation and massive sanctions. In this case, very little has happened."" But now the UK, France and Canada want an immediate halt to Israel's latest offensive.  On 19 May, prime ministers Sir Keir Starmer and Mark Carney, and President Emmanuel Macron, stated, ""We have always supported Israel's right to defend Israelis against terrorism. But this escalation is wholly disproportionate… We will not stand by while the Netanyahu Government pursues these egregious actions."" Sanctions may be coming. The UK and France are actively discussing the circumstances in which they would be prepared to recognise Palestine as an independent state. Netanyahu quoted from a poem by Hayim Nahman Bialik, Israel's national poet, in his TV speech to the Israeli people on 7 October as they wrestled with fear, anger and trauma. He chose the line: ""Revenge for the blood of a little child has yet been devised by Satan."" It comes from In the City of Slaughter, which is widely regarded as the most significant Hebrew poem of the 20th Century. Bialik wrote it as a young man in 1903, after he had visited the scene of a pogrom against Jews in Kishinev, a town then in imperial Russia and now called Chişinǎu, the capital of present-day Moldova. Over three days, Christian mobs murdered 49 Jews and raped at least 600 Jewish women. Antisemitic brutality and killing in Europe was a major reason why Zionist Jews wanted to settle in Palestine to build their own state, in what they regarded as their historic homeland. Their ambition clashed with the desire of Palestinian Arabs to keep their land. Britain, the colonial power, did much to make their conflict worse. By 1929 Vincent Sheean, an American journalist, was describing Jerusalem in a way that is grimly familiar to reporters there almost a century later. ""The situation here is awful,"" he wrote. ""Every day I expect the worst."" He added that violence was in the air, ""The temperature rose – you could stick your hand out in the air and feel it rising."" Sheean's account of the 1920s illustrates the conflict's deep root system in the land that Israelis and Palestinians both want and have not found a way, or a will, to share or separate. Palestinians see a direct line between the Gaza war and the destruction of their society in 1948 when Israel became independent, which they call the Catastrophe. But Netanyahu, and many other Israelis and their supporters abroad connected the October attacks to the centuries of persecution Jews suffered in Europe, which culminated with Nazi Germany killing six million Jews in the Holocaust. Netanyahu used the same references to hit back when Macron said in May that the Israeli blockade of Gaza was ""shameful"" and ""unacceptable"". Netanyahu said that Macron had ""once again chosen to side with a murderous Islamist terrorist organisation and echo its despicable propaganda, accusing Israel of blood libels"".  The blood libel is a notorious antisemitic trope that goes back to medieval Europe, falsely accusing Jews of killing Christians, especially children, to use their blood in religious rituals. After a couple who worked for the Israeli embassy in Washington DC were shot dead, the gunman told police, ""I did it for Palestine, I did it for Gaza."" Netanyahu connected the murders with the criticisms of Israel's conduct made by the leaders of the UK, France and Canada. In a video posted on X, he declared: ""I say to President Macron, Prime Minister Carney and Prime Minister Starmer: When mass murderers, rapists, baby killers and kidnappers thank you, you're on the wrong side of justice. You're on the wrong side of humanity, and you're on the wrong side of history. ""For 18 years, we had a de facto Palestinian state. It's called Gaza. And what did we get? Peace? No. We got the most savage slaughter of Jews since the Holocaust."" Netanyahu has also referred to the long history of antisemitism in Europe when warrants calling for his arrest, along with his former defence minister Yoav Gallant, who was defence minister for the first 13 months of the war, were issued by the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague. The court had also issued arrest warrants for three Hamas leaders, including Yahya Sinwar, considered the mastermind behind 7 October. All three have since been killed by Israel. A panel of ICC judges decided that there were ""reasonable grounds"" to believe that Netanyahu and Gallant bore criminal responsibility. ""As co-perpetrators for committing the acts jointly with others: the war crime of starvation as a method of warfare; and the crimes against humanity of murder, persecution, and other inhumane acts."" In a defiant statement, Netanyahu rejected ""false and absurd charges"". He compared the ICC to the antisemitic conspiracy that sent Alfred Dreyfus, a Jewish officer in the French army, to the penal colony on Devil's Island for treason in 1894. Dreyfus, who was innocent, was eventually pardoned but the affair caused a major political crisis. ""The antisemitic decision of the International Criminal Court is a modern Dreyfus trial – and will end the same way,"" the statement said. ""No war is more just than the war Israel has been waging in Gaza since October 7th 2023, when the Hamas terrorist organisation launched a murderous assault and perpetrated the largest massacre against the Jewish People since the Holocaust."" British barrister Helena Kennedy KC was on a panel that was asked by the ICC's chief prosecutor to assess the evidence against Netanyahu and Gallant. Baroness Kennedy and her colleagues, all distinguished jurists, decided that there were reasonable grounds to go ahead with the warrants. She rejects the accusation that the court and the prosecutor were motivated by antisemitism. ""We've got to always remember the horrors that the Jewish community have suffered over centuries,"" she told me at her chambers in London. ""The world is right to feel a great compassion for the Jewish experience."" But a history of persecution did not, she said, give Israel licence to do what it's doing in Gaza. ""The Holocaust has filled us all with a high sense of guilt, and so it should because we were complicit. But it also teaches us the lesson that we mustn't be complicit now when we see crimes being committed. ""You have to conduct a war according to law, and I'm a firm believer that the only way that you ever create peace is by behaving in just ways, and justice is fundamental to all of this. And I'm afraid that we're not seeing that."" Stronger words came from Danny Blatman, an Israeli historian of the Holocaust and head of the Institute of Contemporary Jewry at Hebrew University in Jerusalem. Prof Blatman, who is the son of Holocaust survivors, says that Israeli politicians have for many years used the memory of the Holocaust as ""a tool to attack governments and public opinion in the world, and warn them that accusing Israel of any atrocities towards the Palestinians is antisemitism"". The result he says is that potential critics ""shut their mouths because they're afraid of being attacked by Israelis, by politicians as antisemites"". Lord Sumption, a former justice of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom, believes Israel should have learned from its own history. ""The terrible Jewish experience of persecution and mass killing in the past should give Israel a horror of inflicting the same things on other peoples."" History is inescapable in the Middle East, always present, a storehouse of justification to be plundered. Israel could not wage war in Gaza using its chosen tactics without American military, financial and diplomatic support. President Donald Trump has shown signs of impatience, forcing Netanyahu to allow a few cracks in the siege that has brought Gaza to the edge of famine. Netanyahu himself continues to express support for Trump's widely condemned proposal to turn Gaza into ""the Riviera of the Mediterranean"", by emptying it of Palestinians and turning it over to the Americans for redevelopment. That is code for the mass expulsion of Palestinians, which would be a war crime. Netanyahu's ultra-nationalist allies want to replace them with Jewish settlers. Trump himself seems silent about the plan. But the Trump administration's support for Israel, and its actions in Gaza, looks undiminished. On 4 June, the US vetoed a UN Security Council resolution calling for an ""unconditional and permanent"" ceasefire, the release of all the hostages and the lifting of restrictions on humanitarian aid. The other 14 members voted in favour. The next day the Americans sanctioned four judges from the ICC in retaliation for the decision to issue arrest warrants.  US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said he was protecting the sovereignty of the US and Israel against ""illegitimate actions"". ""I call on the countries that still support the ICC, many of whose freedom was purchased at the price of great American sacrifices to fight this disgraceful attack on our nation and Israel."" Instead the ICC has had statements of support and solidarity from European leaders. A broad and increasingly bitter gap has opened up between the US and Europe over the Gaza war, and over the legitimacy of criticising Israel's conduct.   Israel and the Trump administration reject the idea that the laws of war apply equally to all sides, because they claim it implies a false and wrong equivalence between Hamas and Israel. Jan Egeland can see the split between Europe and the US growing. ""I hope now that Europe will grow a spine,"" he says. ""There have been new tones, finally, coming from London, from Berlin, from Paris, from Brussels, after all these months of industrial-scale hypocrisy where they didn't see that there was a world record in killed aid workers, in killed nurses, in killed doctors, in killed teachers, in killed children, and all while journalists like yourself have been denied access, denied to be witnessing this. ""It's something that the West will learn to regret really — that they were so spineless."" The question of whether Israel is committing genocide in Gaza outrages Israel and its supporters, led by the United States. Lawyers who believe the evidence does not support the accusation have stood up to oppose the case brought by South Africa at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) alleging genocide against Palestinians. But it will not go away.  The Netanyahu loyalist Boaz Bismuth answered the genocide question like this. ""How can you accuse us of genocide when the Palestinian population grew, I don't know how many times more? How can you accuse me of ethnic cleansing when I'm moving [the] population inside Gaza to protect them? How can you accuse me when I lose soldiers in order to protect my enemies?"" It is hard to prove genocide has happened; the legal bar prosecutors have to clear has been set deliberately high. But leading lawyers who have spent decades assessing matters of legal fact to see if there is a case to answer believe it is not necessary to wait for the process started in January last year by South Africa to make a years-long progress through the ICJ. We asked Lord Sumption, the former Supreme Court justice, for his opinion. ""Genocide is a question of intent,"" he wrote. ""It means killing, maiming or imposing intolerable conditions on a national or ethnic group with intent to destroy them in whole or in part.  ""Statements by Netanyahu and his ministers suggest that the object of current operations is to force the Arab population of Gaza to leave by killing and starving them if they stay. These things make genocide the most plausible explanation for what is now happening."" South Africa based much of its genocide case against Israel on inflammatory language used by Israeli leaders. One example was the biblical reference Netanyahu used when Israel sent troops into Gaza, comparing Hamas to Amalek. In the Bible God commands the Israelites to destroy their persecutors, the Amalekites. Another was Defence Minister Yoav Gallant's declaration just after the Hamas attacks when he ordered a complete siege on the Gaza Strip:  ""There will be no electricity, no food, no fuel, everything is closed. We are fighting human animals and we act accordingly."" Ralph Wilde, UCL professor of international law, also believes there is proof of genocide. ""Unfortunately, yes, and there is now no doubt legally as to that, and indeed that has been the case for some time."" He points out that an advisory opinion of the ICJ has already determined that Israel's presence in Gaza and the West Bank was illegal. Prof Wilde compares Western governments' responses to the war in Gaza to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. ""There has been no court decision as to the illegality of Russia's action in Ukraine. Nonetheless, states have found it possible already to make public proclamations determining the illegality of that action. There is nothing stopping them doing that in this case.  ""And so, if they are suggesting that they are going to wait, the question to ask them is, why are you waiting for a court to tell you what you already know?"" Helena Kennedy KC is ""very anxious about the casual use of the word genocide and I avoid it myself because I do think that there has to be a very high level in law, a very high level of intent necessary to prove it"". ""Are we saying that it's not genocide but it is crimes against humanity? You think that makes it sound okay? Terrible crimes against humanity? I think we're in the process of seeing the most grievous kind of crimes taking place. ""I do think we're on a trajectory that could very easily be towards genocide, and as a lawyer I think that there's certainly an argument that is being made strongly for that."" Baroness Kennedy says her advice to the British government if it was asked for would be, ""We've got to be very careful about being complicit in grievous crimes ourselves."" Eventually, a ceasefire will come. It will not end the conflict, or head off the certainty of a long and bitter epilogue. The genocide case at the ICJ guarantees that. So do the International Criminal Court's arrest warrants against Benjamin Netanyahu and Yoav Gallant.  Once journalists and war crimes investigators can get into the Gaza Strip, they will emerge with more hard facts about what has happened.  Those who have been into Gaza with the UN or medical teams say that even people who have seen many wars find it hard to grasp the extent of the damage; so many islands of human misery in an ocean of rubble. I keep thinking about something an Israeli officer said the only time I've been into Gaza since the war started. I spent a few hours in the ruins with the Israeli army, one month into the war, when it had already made northern Gaza into a wasteland He started telling me how they did their best to not to fire on Palestinian civilians. Then he trailed off, and paused, and told me no-one in Gaza could be innocent because they all supported Hamas.

6/8/2025,Article,When can a president deploy National Guard on US soil?,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/cj93d3r0zz0o,"US President Donald Trump says he has deployed 2,000 National Guard troops to Los Angeles to uphold ""very strong law and order"", after violent protests against immigration raids erupted in America's second-biggest city. His decision to summon the National Guard overruled the authority of California Governor Gavin Newsom, who called the move ""purposefully inflammatory"".  At least 118 immigrants have been arrested in operations across the city over the past week, which led to clashes as demonstrators gathered outside businesses that were thought to have been raided. The LA County Sheriff's Department said crowds ""became increasingly agitated, throwing objects and exhibiting violent behaviour"", prompting police to use tear gas and stun grenades. Governor Newsom, along with the LA mayor and a California congresswoman, said in separate comments they believed local police could handle the protests. Twenty-nine people were arrested, according to local officials. To quell the growing unrest, Trump issued a directive under a rarely used federal law that allows the president to federalise National Guard troops under certain circumstances. The National Guard acts as a hybrid entity that serves both state and federal interests. Typically, a state's National Guard force is activated at the request of the governor.  In this case, Trump has circumvented that step by invoking a specific provision of the US Code of Armed Services titled 10 U.S.C. 12406, which lists three circumstances under which the president can federalise the National Guard. If the US ""is invaded or is in danger of invasion by a foreign nation""; ""there is a rebellion or danger of a rebellion"" against the government; or ""the president is unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States"".  Trump said in his memorandum requesting the National Guard that the protests in Los Angeles ""constitute a form of rebellion against the authority of the Government of the United States"". The National Guard's role in Los Angeles will be to protect federal agents, including US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) and Homeland Security, as they carry out their duties.  The troops will not be conducting their own immigration raids or performing ordinary law enforcement activities against civilians.  The law generally prohibits domestic use of federal troops for civilian law enforcement, outside of some exceptions like the Insurrection Act.  Although Trump has threatened to invoke that act in the past, during the Black Lives Matter protests of 2020, for example, he has not done so here.  According to experts, this is the first time the National Guard has been activated without request of the state's governor since 1965. In 1992, the National Guard was federalised in LA during riots after police officers were acquitted for the beating of black motorist Rodney King. Then-President George HW Bush sent troops at the request of California's governor at the time, Pete Wilson. In 2020, National Guard troops were deployed in some states in the wake of protests over the killing of George Floyd.  Senior figures in the Trump administration have backed the president's decision to mobilise the National Guard. Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth said on social media it was ""COMMON SENSE"", adding: ""Violence & destruction against federal agents & federal facilities will NOT be tolerated.""  Hegseth also said that active duty US Marines stationed at nearby Camp Pendleton would be sent if needed and were on ""high alert"".  Senator Markwayne Mullin, an Oklahoma Republican, told CNN: ""Does it look like it's [the protests] under control? Absolutely not."" However, several Californian officials insist city police are equipped to deal with the unrest, and the military's involvement is unnecessary.  California congresswoman Nanette Barragán, a Democrat who represents the city of Paramount in LA's suburbs where the protests have taken place, told CNN: ""We don't need the help."" The National Guard is ""only going to make things worse"", she said.  Her words echo Governor Newsom, who also spoke against National Guard troops being sent to his state. ""The federal government is taking over the California National Guard and deploying 2,000 soldiers in Los Angeles - not because there is a shortage of law enforcement, but because they want a spectacle,"" Newsom wrote on X.  LA Mayor Karen Bass told ABC7 the National Guard was not needed. Ice officers conducted raids in heavily Latino parts of LA on Friday, as part of Trump's crackdown on illegal immigration. Forty-four people were arrested, said a spokesperson for Homeland Security Investigations, a branch of ICE. The efforts are a part of the president's aim to enact the ""biggest deportation operation"" in US history.  Los Angeles, where over one-third of the population is foreign-born, has been a big target. In early May, Ice announced it had arrested 239 undocumented migrants during a weeklong operation in the LA area, as overall arrests and deportations lagged behind Trump's expectations.  The following month, the White House increased its goal for Ice officials to make at least 3,000 arrests per day. Authorities have expanded their search increasingly to include workplaces such as restaurants and retail shops. The LA raids that sparked the protests occurred at a wholesale clothing supplier and a Home Depot outlet. ""You're going to see more work site enforcement than you've ever seen in the history of this nation,"" Trump's border official Thomas Homan said. The ambitious deportation campaign has included rounding up migrants on military planes and sending them to Guantanamo Bay before bringing them back to Louisiana. Other migrants have been deported to a mega-prison in El Salvador, including at least one who was in the US legally. Some migrants have been sent to countries where they are not from.  Many of these actions have been met by legal challenges in court.  On Friday, protesters clashed with federal agents outside a clothing wholesaler. They threw objects at agents and attempted to block federal officials from carrying out their arrests. In response, officials in riot gear used flash bang grenades and pepper spray to subdue the crowd. Outside a Home Depot store in Paramount, roughly 20 miles (32 km) south of downtown LA, tear gas and flash bangs were deployed against protesters that gathered again on Saturday.  In a social media post, Ice described the scene on Saturday, saying: ""Our brave officers were vastly outnumbered - over 1,000 rioters surrounded and attacked a federal building.""  Responding to the protests, the LA Police Department said it made 29 arrests, almost all for failure to disperse, which is a misdemeanour, according to the BBC's media partner CBS News. On Sunday, day three of the protests, National Guard troops arrived to LA and were seen walling off protesters outside of a federal building that contains a detention centre.  In one of the more tense exchanges, federal officers with Department of Homeland Security badges fired what appeared to be tear gas and pepper spray and some kind of non-lethal round towards the crowd.

6/8/2025,Article,Our mum went to jail for stealing our inheritance,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/cvgdzznggdvo,"Two sisters whose mother went from being their best friend to stealing their £50,000 inheritance say they have been left feeling anxious and unable to trust anyone. Katherine Hill, 53, from Alltwen in Pontardawe, Neath Port Talbot, and her 93-year-old father Gerald Hill from Fairwood in Swansea were found guilty of fraud by abuse of power after a trial last year. They were sentenced to 30 months in prison and a 12-month sentence, suspended for 18 months, respectively. On Monday, [Katherine]Hill was ordered to repay the money, which was left to her daughters Gemma and Jessica Thomas by their grandmother Margaret Hill. ""I'll never have a relationship with my mother now,"" said Jessica. Swansea Crown Court previously heard, due to inflation, the sum stolen by the ""greedy and spiteful"" Hills was now worth about £65,000. Katherine Hill put the money in an instant access Barclays Everyday Saver account, despite being advised not to, and both she and her dad had cards to access it - draining the contents within a year. Between March 2016 and March 2017, the account where the money was held was emptied in 10 withdrawals, with £35,000 withdrawn in three transactions alone, the court heard. Gemma and Jessica grew up in Neath Port Talbot with their parents, and said Hill was a ""good mother"". ""She was like my best friend,"" said Gemma, now 26, adding ""no-one saw this coming."" She said Hill did not have a good relationship with her own mother Margaret Hill - who split from her father when Hill was a teenager - though the girls did not know why. Margaret Hill died in 2014, while [Katherine] Hill was divorcing the girls' father, Chris Thomas. At the time Jessica was just 12 and not told about the inheritance, but Gemma, who was 15 ""understood a little bit more"". The £50,000 was placed in a trust fund with their mother as a trustee - to be accessed when they were 25. Following the divorce, the girls stayed living with their mother for about six months, but say she would often leave them alone for long periods of time while she visited her new boyfriend. ""It would start where she was going on dates and stuff. And I think I was at that perfect age of 'my mother's going out for the night, I can have friends over', and I was kind of loving it for a while,"" said Gemma. ""But it got to the point where it was happening every weekend and people expected that I wasn't going to have a parent at home, and I would be like, 'please will you stay home this one time?'."" Mr Thomas decided his daughters would be better living with him, so the girls moved out of their family home and with him, while Hill moved in with her current partner, Phillip Lloyd. The sisters said their mum would sometimes take them out at the weekend, to a pub or McDonalds, but the conversation would often centre around their father and her upset that they left. ""I think she just could never get over the fact that we were choosing to live with him over her,"" said Gemma. Jessica said it was ""clear from then that we weren't really a very important thing to her"". ""I remember when she came to see me on my 13th birthday, and took me out for the day, saying she had to leave early because she was going out with [her boyfriend] and his family. ""It wasn't like she'd spend a lot of money on us... not 50 grand's worth, anyway."" They said, looking back, there were signs of extravagance from Hill and her partner, such as building a back garden pub and hot tub, and going on holidays. But nothing set off alarm bells, as Hill had also received her own money from her late mother. Now, the girls said, they know it was really them paying for their mum's lifestyle. It was when Gemma phoned her mum to ask about accessing the money early, as she planned to buy their childhood home from their dad, that the claims the inheritance never existed began. She said her mum told her ""the money's not yours"" and blocked her number, before later claiming in court it had been posted through the girls' letterboxes. Jessica, who is now a nurse, recalled the shock of discovering the money existed, and then immediately that it was gone. ""How can you grieve something you never had? But [also] she's robbed me of an opportunity not a lot of people get."" She and her boyfriend currently live with his parents, and she said saving up to move out without her inheritance would take a very long time. Gemma said she was angry, adding she found it frustrating the more time went on and the more Hill lied. She said the initial confusion and hurt was hard, given their happy memories of their mum, and the woman she saw in court did not seem like the same person. ""I'd sit there and be like, 'What if we're all wrong? What if she hasn't done it?' ""But I have to accept that she has."" Gemma said giving evidence in court was stressful, but the relief came more from feeling validated, than from money or the sentences. ""When it actually was the case that she was being sent down... it was like we were being told that we're not crazy,"" she said. The girls said they saw people on social media claiming they were in prison with their mum and she ""was still saying that she was innocent"".  ""And people would believe in her... that's the most shocking thing to me,"" said Jessica.  ""Even though the relationship had started to break down before this, it could have possibly been fixed, whereas we're at that point now that we'll never go back to how we used to be."" She added their mum had ""showed no remorse for anything she did"".  ""She would look at me while we were standing up giving evidence, and she was shaking her head as if I was the one telling lies,"" she said. ""It's like she'll never take responsibility for what she's done."" Jessica said she had been going to counselling for many years, to address ""massive issues with trust"", while Gemma said she became ""very needy in friendships"". ""[I thought] 'if my mother doesn't love me, who the hell is going to love me?'"" Now a mother herself to a two-month-old boy, she said she saw the betrayal on a new level. ""I came home [after court] on Monday and I was feeding my son. I was looking at him, and I was like, I could not go 10 days, not even 10 hours really, without knowing how he was or what was going on in his life. Never mind the past 10 years. ""It doesn't make any sense, she's missing out on all of that."" Jessica said still living and working in the same area as her mum brought her anxiety and she lived with a tic, which a doctor told her had been triggered by trauma. ""The whole thing has just had a massive effect on me, mentally and physically."" She added she did not know how they would have coped without each other, or their father, who supported them emotionally and financially through the long legal process. Now, with the result they wanted, they hope they will eventually see the money and ""let go of this part of our lives"". They say they want to forget their mother, and the end of court proceedings has brought a kind of closure, allowing them to ""finally breathe"". Copyright 2025 BBC.

6/8/2025,Article,'I burst into tears': How airline carry-on confusion triggered legal row,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/cz70ny09x07o,"Determined to avoid baggage fees for his holiday to Pisa, Benjamin Till trawled several different shops armed with a tape measure in search of the right suitcase.  Eventually, he found a case within the dimensions EasyJet allows for a free underseat bag - or so he thought.  When Mr Till arrived at London Gatwick Airport in December 2023, he discovered those measurements included wheels, meaning his bag was deemed slightly too big. He protested, but eventually paid £48 to bring the bag on board. He says he was told to remove the wheels for the way back - which he did. But at the gate on his way home, he was told the suitcase was still too large, so he sat on the floor, unpacking his dirty underwear and souvenirs into a bin bag. ""I don't mind admitting that I actually burst into tears because it was so humiliating,"" he says.  An EasyJet spokesperson told the BBC its ground crew had to ensure non-checked bags were within maximum dimensions ""to safely and securely fit"", and that rules were made clear to customers when they booked.  Stories of passengers caught out by baggage rules they feel are inconsistent or confusing are common, with many customers complaining or seeking clarity from budget airlines on social media.  Different airlines have varying rules on the acceptable size and weight of an underseat personal item or an overhead cabin bag, with some charging customers to bring the latter.  For people who fall foul of these rules, some airlines charge hefty fees to upgrade a bag from a free personal item to an overhead cabin bag at the airport gate, or to stow an oversized cabin bag in the hold. Passenger confusion has prompted the European Union's largest consumer group to push for fairer and more consistent hand luggage rules, and caused one government to start cracking down on airlines over bag charges. The EU is now looking at changing its laws - changes which would also affect UK passengers who are travelling to or from an EU destination using an EU-based airline.  On Thursday, EU transport ministers proposed standardised sizing for free underseat baggage on EU airlines, among other air travel and passenger rights' changes - meaning this could become EU law if their position is accepted by the European Parliament. Budget airlines say their baggage policies comply with the law while keeping fares low, but they have been facing mounting pressure and calls for change. EU transport ministers proposed that passengers should be guaranteed one free personal item, measuring up to 40x30x15cm (including wheels and handles) - or which could reasonably fit under a plane seat. These rules would apply to EU-based airlines (such as Ryanair, Wizz Air and EasyJet), including when they are carrying passengers from a non-EU country like the UK to an EU country and vice-versa, but not third-party airlines. New rules would add clarity to an EU court ruling from 11 years ago, which stated hand baggage should not be subject to an extra fee, provided it met ""reasonable"" weight and dimensions, but did not say what reasonable was. Currently, Ryanair allows a free carry-on bag of 40x20x25cm, while EasyJet's dimensions for a free bag are a more generous 45x36x20 cm, including wheels and handles. The ministers' proposal was silent, however, on the issue of whether airlines could charge for overhead cabin bags – meaning that if their proposal was adopted into law, the current situation would not change and airlines could keep charging for that kind of hand baggage, which some in Europe have lobbied to stop. The European Consumer Organisation, BEUC, an umbrella group for 45 independent consumer organisations from 32 countries, believes Thursday's proposals do not go far enough, and legitimise ""charging for reasonably sized hand luggage"". In November, five airlines were fined a total of €179m (£150m) in Spain for ""abusive"" practices, including charging for hand luggage. Spain's Consumer Rights Ministry said at the time that it planned to ban charging extra for carry-on luggage and other policies. The airlines had said they would appeal the decision.  Regarding charges for overheard cabin bags, Ryanair said it fully complied with EU law in its policy, which allows one small bag on board free of charge. ""If airlines were forced to include additional carry-on bags as part of the basic fare, it would reduce choice and drive up air fares for all passengers, which would harm consumers,"" the airline said. Industry group Airlines For Europe said charging different amounts depending on baggage ""allows passengers to choose the exact services that best suits their needs"". Hand luggage dimensions should be universal, says Jane Hawkes, a consumer expert specialising in travel. ""I don't really see why it can't be, and why they can't come to a voluntary agreement as to what those requirements should be for your baggage,"" she tells the BBC. ""There have to be restrictions, obviously, but a one-size-fits-all kind of approach would make it a lot simpler for passengers,"" she says. BEUC said policymakers should define what ""reasonable"" size and weight was ""to avoid surprises at the airport and ultimately reduce the number of disputes costing consumers and airlines time and money"". Ms Hawkes suggests passengers make sure they measure their bag after it is packed, as it may expand when it is full and go over the limit.  She adds that consumers should not just be swayed by the fare price, as ""if you've got an airline that encompasses [baggage] without you having to pay extra costs to start with, then that might be more of a better option for you"". Mr Till would welcome a one-size-fits-all approach to underseat bags.  ""It's just really, really unfair and ridiculous and there should be one size that goes across all of the airlines,"" he says. He also criticises the permitted size of underseat cabin bags, saying ""it was such a tiny, tiny size of luggage that you were allowed that it had taken me so long to find something that was so small"". Still, he was grateful for the inexpensive air fare, and the place he had to stay in Italy, because ""otherwise I wouldn't be able to come to this beautiful country"". Copyright 2025 BBC.

6/8/2025,Article,Iran expands dog-walking ban,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/cn0gngq4wjqo,"Iranian officials have expanded a ban on dog walking to a swathe of cities across the country, citing public order and health and safety concerns. The ban - which mirrors a 2019 police order that barred dog walking in the capital, Tehran - has been extended to at least 18 other cities in the past week. Transporting dogs in vehicles has also been outlawed. Dog ownership has been frowned upon in Iran since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, with dogs viewed as ""unclean"" by authorities and a legacy of Western cultural influence. But despite efforts to discourage it, dog ownership is rising, particularly among young people, and it is viewed as a form of rebellion against the restrictive Iranian regime. Cities including Isfahan and Kerman have introduced bans in recent days, according to news agency AFP. An official from the western city of Ilam, where a ban was implemented on Sunday, said ""legal action"" would be taken against people who violated the new rules, according to local media. However, enforcing restrictions in the past has been patchy, while many dog owners continue to walk their dogs in public in Tehran and other parts of Iran. There is no national law that outright bans dog ownership, but prosecutors often issue local restrictions that are enforced by police. ""Dog walking is a threat to public health, peace and comfort,"" Abbas Najafi, prosecutor of the western city of Hamedan, told state newspaper Iran. Owners have sometimes been arrested and dogs confiscated for being walked in public. Many have taken to walking their dogs in secluded areas at night or driving them around to evade detection. Politicians in the Islamic regime regard pet ownership as un-Islamic. Many religious scholars view petting dogs or coming into contact with their saliva as ""najis"" or ritually impure. Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has previously described dog ownership - other than for the purposes of herding, hunting and security - as ""reprehensible"". In 2021, 75 lawmakers condemned dog ownership as a ""destructive social problem"" that could ""gradually change the Iranian and Islamic way of life"". Iran's Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance banned advertisements for pets or pet-related products in 2010 - and in 2014 there was a drive in parliament to fine and even flog dog-walkers, though the bill did not pass. Following the recent crackdown, critics argue the police should focus on public safety at a time of growing concern over violent crime, rather than targeting dog owners and restricting personal freedoms. Dog ownership, defying Iran's mandatory hijab laws, attending underground parties and drinking alcohol have long been forms of quiet rebellion against Iran's theocratic regime. Copyright 2025 BBC.

6/8/2025,Article,Rwanda pulls out of regional bloc over DR Congo row,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/cx2qke0xkrdo,"Rwanda says it is pulling out of a central African regional bloc after a diplomatic row over its involvement in the conflict in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo. The country was supposed to take up the chairman role of the Economic Community of Central African States (Eccas), which rotates between its 11 members. But it was prevented from doing so at a meeting on Saturday in Equatorial Guinea. Announcing its decision to leave Eccas, Rwanda said its right to take up the ""chairmanship… was deliberately ignored in order to impose the DRC's diktat"". As a result, it saw ""no justification for remaining in an organisation whose current functioning runs counter to its founding principles and intended purpose"". The row comes as efforts to end the fighting in eastern DR Congo continue. Following US mediation, Rwanda and DR Congo are working on a draft peace plan that is expected to be signed later this month. According to a statement from the Congolese presidency, the Eccas leaders at the summit ""acknowledged the aggression against the Democratic Republic of Congo by Rwanda and ordered the aggressor country to withdraw its troops from Congolese soil"". It added that until the dispute was resolved, it was decided that Equatorial Guinea would remain in the chairman role ""to the detriment of Rwanda"". In comments directed at Rwanda, Congolese government spokesman Patrick Muyaya said that ""one cannot continually and voluntarily violate the principles that underpin our regional institutions and claim to want to preside over them"". He added that the Eccas decision ""should inspire other regional organisations to adopt a firmer stance against Rwanda"". Rwanda has been accused of supporting M23 rebels in the east of DR Congo. The group has made major advances at the beginning of the year, taking the key regional cities of Goma and Bukavu. DR Congo's government, the US and France have identified Rwanda as backing the M23. Last year, a UN experts' report said that up to 4,000 Rwandan troops were fighting alongside the rebels. But Rwanda has denied the accusations, saying instead that its troops were deployed along its border to prevent the conflict spilling over into its territory. Rwanda has once before, in 2007, left Eccas, whose mission is to foster co-operation and strengthen regional integration in central Africa. It rejoined several years later.

6/8/2025,Article,Prince William warns ocean life 'diminishing before our eyes',https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/c3d4387x1d0o,"The Prince of Wales has described the challenge of protecting the world's oceans as ""like none that we have ever faced before."" In a speech delivered to the Blue Economy and Finance Forum in Monaco, Prince William said life on the ocean floor was ""diminishing before our eyes"" and called for ambitious action ""on a global, national and local level"". At the Grimaldi Forum, named after Monaco's royal family, the Prince spoke in both English and French as he laid out what was at risk. ""The truth is that healthy oceans are essential to all life on earth. They generate half of the world's oxygen, regulate our climate and provide food for more than three billion people,"" he said. Rising temperatures, pollution and overfishing are causing huge damage to the world's oceans and the communities that rely on them. The forum comes ahead of the UN Ocean Conference in Nice, France, this week, with the events looking at the role oceans play in global trade, food security and sustainable energy. In Monaco on Sunday, the Prince was speaking to an audience of environmentalists, scientists and investors – many of whom have travelled there with a view to financing ocean protection projects. Prince William acknowledged that investing in ocean work can be a tricky proposition for investors. ""All too often, it can feel distant and disconnected from our everyday lives, allowing us to forget just how vital it is,"" he said. ""We must realise the potential of the blue economy for our ecosystems, our economies and our communities."" The Prince was speaking as founder of the Earthshot Prize, which gives out five £1m prizes each year for the best solutions to the greatest climate challenges. Several Earthshot winners and past finalists were in the audience. Enric Sala, of the National Geographic Society's Pristine Seas project, was a finalist in 2021 and has pioneered work to protect marine life. He is also part of the team that has produced Sir David Attenborough's new film, Oceans, which Prince William described as ""the most compelling argument for immediate action I have ever seen"". ""Watching human activity reduce beautiful sea forests to barren deserts at the base of our oceans is heartbreaking,"" the Prince said. ""For many, it is an urgent wake up call to just what is going on in our oceans. But it can no longer be a matter of 'out of sight, out of mind'."" He ended his speech saying action was needed for future generations and quoted Sir David. ""If we save the sea, we save our world."" The Prince interviewed Sir David at the premiere of Oceans last month, with the film described by its producer as ""the greatest message [Sir David] has ever told"". Kensington Palace described the speech as a ""landmark intervention"" by Prince William, using his platform to generate change and bring in investments to scale up ocean solutions. While in southern France, the Prince met President Chavez of Costa Rica, France's President Macron and Prince Albert of Monaco - a supporter of many oceans projects and a key player at the forum. Prince William will also attend a closed session, held in private, with ocean experts and investors. Additional reporting by Adam Hale. Copyright 2025 BBC.

6/9/2025,Article,Snook and Scherzinger win top prizes at Tony Awards,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/cx2ql1jl74no,"Succession star Sarah Snook and singer Nicole Scherzinger were among the big winners at Sunday's Tony Awards. Scherzinger was named best actress in a musical for her role as faded film star Norma Desmond in Sunset Boulevard, Jamie Lloyd's minimalist reboot of Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical.  In an emotional acceptance speech, Scherzinger reflected on her recent Broadway success, which came two decades after shooting to fame with the Pussycat Dolls.  ""Growing up, I always felt like I didn't belong, but you all have made me feel like I belong and I have come home, at last,"" she said. ""If there's anyone out there who feels like they don't belong or your time hasn't come, don't give up."" She added: ""Just keep on giving and giving because the world needs your love and your light now more than ever. This is a testament that love always wins."" The singer and former X Factor judge won the same prize at the UK equivalent of the Tonys, the Olivier Awards, for her performance in the show's original West End run. She said it had been an ""honour"" to work with composer Lord Lloyd Webber, and paid tribute to Lloyd, saying: ""You saw in me what no one else did. You have given us all new ways to dream and you have changed my life forever."" Scherzinger also sang As If We Never Said Goodbye during the ceremony, a performance that was introduced by Glenn Close, who played Desmond in Sunset Boulevard when it played on Broadway in 1995. The Tony Awards, hosted by Wicked star Cynthia Erivo at Radio City Music Hall in New York, celebrate the best in US theatre, and particularly Broadway. Snook also repeated her Olivier win, taking best leading actress in a play, for performing all 26 roles in a one-woman stage adaptation of Oscar Wilde's novel The Picture of Dorian Gray. In her acceptance speech, the actress said: ""This means so much for a little Australian girl to be here on Broadway. ""[The Picture of Dorian Gray] is billed as a one-person show, but I don't feel alone any night that I do this show. There are so many people on stage making it work and behind the stage making it work."" Other winners included Maybe Happy Ending, about two outdated robots who find connection. It took home best musical, while its star Darren Criss, who previously appeared in Glee, also won an acting prize. ""I have such immense pride to get to be part of this notably diverse, exquisite Broadway season this year,"" he said. Paying tribute to his wife, he added: ""Your love and your support for me and our beautiful children, combined with the miracle of working on something as magical as Maybe Happy Ending, has been and will always be award enough."" Purpose, about an African-American family who reunite in Chicago, was named best play, a month after winning the 2025 Pulitzer Prize for Drama. Meanwhile, Cole Escola was named best actor in a play for Oh Mary!, a one-act reimagining of Abraham Lincoln's assassination through the eyes of his wife - a raging alcoholic who dreams of life as a cabaret star. Sunset Boulevard also won best musical revival, while Eureka Day, about a school in California which must confront its vaccination policy after an outbreak of mumps among the pupils, won best revival of a play. Stranger Things: The First Shadow, a stage adaptation of the hit Netflix show, and Buena Vista Social Club, which tells the story of the Cuban musical group, were among the other winners. The biggest winners: British actor Jak Malone was named best featured actor in a musical - the Tonys equivalent of the supporting actor prize - for Operation Mincemeat, the story of the British plot to fool the Nazis during World War Two. Elsewhere in the ceremony, Erivo was joined on stage by singer Sara Bareilles for a rendition of Tomorrow from the musical Annie, in tribute to those in the theatre community who had died throughout the year. The song's composer, Charles Strouse, died last month. Presenters at the event included Samuel L Jackson, Oprah Winfrey, Ben Stiller and Lin-Manuel Miranda. The original cast of Hamilton reunited to perform a rapturously received medley, to celebrate the show's 10th anniversary. In the last year, a string of new shows and stars drew 14.7 million people to Broadway performances, grossing $1.89bn (£1.39bn) at the box office.

6/9/2025,Article,Trump travel ban barring citizens from 12 countries takes effect,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/cz9y72v5yv5o,"President Donald Trump's sweeping new travel ban which bars citizens of 12 countries from entering the United States came into effect at 00:00 ET (05:00 BST) on Monday.  The order, which Trump signed last week, restricts the nationals of Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, Congo-Brazzaville, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen from entering the US.  Nationals from a further seven countries - Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela - will face partial travel restrictions. The US president said the list could be revised if ""material improvements"" were made, while other countries could be added as ""threats emerge around the world"". It is the second time Trump has ordered a ban on travel from certain countries. He signed a similar order in 2017 during his first term in office. The White House said these ""common sense restrictions"" would ""protect Americans from dangerous foreign actors"". There are a number of people from affected countries who may still be able to enter the US due to a number of exceptions. The order does not apply to: In a video posted to his Truth Social website last week, Trump said the recent attack in Boulder, Colorado ""underscored the extreme dangers"" posed by foreign nationals who had not been ""properly vetted"". Twelve people were injured in Colorado on 1 June when a man attacked a group gathering in support of Israeli hostages. The FBI called it a suspected terror attack and said the suspect had used a makeshift flamethrower, Molotov cocktails and other incendiary devices. The man accused of carrying out the attack was identified as an Egyptian national, but Egypt has not been included on the list of banned countries. Trump's latest order, which is likely to face legal challenges, drew a swift response, at home and abroad. Chad retaliated by suspending all visas to US citizens while Somalia promised to work with the US to address security issues. The African Union, which represents all countries on the continent, called on the US to ""engage in constructive dialogue with the countries concerned"". In the US, Democrats were quick to condemn the move. ""This ban, expanded from Trump's Muslim ban in his first term, will only further isolate us on the world stage,"" Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal wrote on social media. But others support the ban. Congressman Clay Higgins of Louisiana told the BBC that travel to the US was ""a privilege, not a right"". Copyright 2025 BBC.

6/9/2025,Article,How LA erupted over rumours of immigration raid at a hardware store,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/c1kv1lgdpkjo,"Juan and several friends huddled in the car park of a hardware store near Los Angeles, where protests have erupted against US President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown.  Typically, their gatherings include dozens of day labourers, many of whom are undocumented immigrants, seeking work from shoppers or contractors. But on Sunday, only two small pickups advertised that they could help with roofing, repairs or paint jobs outside this branch of Home Depot in the suburb of Paramount, whose population is more than 82% Hispanic. It was one day after the store became the centre of immigration protests, sparked by rumours that day labourers here had been rounded up and arrested. Many who live in the community told the BBC they saw immigration enforcement vehicles in the area. It caused instant fear and panic. Then came reports about raids and arrests of day labourers at Home Depot, a place where many undocumented migrants across the US go to find work. Protests erupted in this Hispanic-majority city, turning violent as rocks and Molotov cocktails were thrown. Authorities used pepper spray, rubber bullets and smoke bombs to subdue the crowd. But the demonstrations in Paramount appear to have spawned out of misinformation. While dozens of migrants have been detained by authorities elsewhere in the area, the rumours of raids at the store were misinformation, according to the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS). ""Despite false reports, there was no ICE 'raid' at a Home Depot in LA,"" the DHS told the BBC. As he leaned on the bed of a small Toyota pickup with his two friends, Juan said: ""No-one really knows what happened. Everyone is afraid."" The unrest in Paramount, which also saw a car set ablaze and businesses looted, became a catalyst for what federal authorities have described as riots throughout the Los Angeles area. On Saturday, President Donald Trump used his authority to call in the California National Guard, something typically decided by a state's governor, as a second day of protests convulsed the city.  As the protests flared up for a third day on Sunday, armed National Guard troops guarded a gated business park across the street from the hardware store. They parked Humvees blocking the area and squared off with protesters hurling insults and waving Mexican flags and banners. ""You're not welcome here!"" one man with a Los Angeles Angels ball cap shouted to the soldiers as another protester uncapped spray paint and wrote an obscenity directed at US Immigration and Customs Enforcement. DHS told the BBC that the guarded area is home to one of their offices and authorities were using it ""as a staging area and rioters found it"". The agency told the BBC they have arrested 118 illegal immigrants in the Los Angeles area this week, including five they say are gang members. The agency said some of these migrants had previous criminal histories that included drug trafficking, assault and robbery. As he prepared to board Air Force One in Morristown, New Jersey, on Sunday, Trump told reporters there were ""violent people"" in Los Angeles ""and they're not gonna get away with it"". Dora Sanchez was still in disbelief from the shocking images that transformed her city the night before. She gathered on Sunday with others in the community at the Chapel of Change church, less than a block from the centre of protests the day before. She and others at the church talked about how this Hispanic community was revitalised over the years and became a close-knit community where neighbours know and watch out for one another. The protests felt like a ""breaking point"" for the immigrant community, she noted. Los Angeles is one of the biggest minority-majority cities in the US. Hispanics not only make up a larger share of the population than any other ethnic background, but immigrants, specifically those from just south in Mexico, are a core part of the history and culture here. The city boasts its status as a sanctuary city, which means it does not co-operate with federal immigration enforcement. Some here said they felt a bubbling tension that seemed to erupt when the Republican president's administration targeted LA's undocumented immigrants. ""It was time to stand up,"" said Maria Gutierrez, who protested in Paramount. ""These are my people."" She said she was born in Mexico, but has lived here since she was a girl. She - like many here - say they have family members who are in the US illegally. ""This is LA,"" she said. ""It touches us all.  ""Everyone has family or knows someone who doesn't have papers.""

6/9/2025,Article,Unlawful assembly declared in downtown LA,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/c87jnnj1pxno,"Protests against immigration raids in Los Angeles escalated on Sunday as US President Donald Trump called to ""bring in the troops"".   Rising unrest saw a major freeway blocked and a row of self-driving cars set on fire as law enforcement used tear gas, rubber bullets and flash bangs to control the crowd. Police called downtown LA an ""unlawful assembly"" area at 23:15 local time on Sunday (07:15 BST on Monday) after three days of protests and dozens of arrests.  Demonstrations began outside the Federal Building, in downtown LA, on Friday after it emerged Immigration Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers were carrying out raids across the city. California Governor Gavin Newsom, along with the LA mayor Karen Bass, said in separate comments on Saturday that they believed local police could handle the protests. But on Saturday night, after two days of clashes between demonstrators and immigration authorities, Trump went against Newsom's wishes and ordered the deployment of 2,000 National Guard.  On Sunday morning, the first group of troops began arriving in the city, staging outside a detention centre where illegal immigrants are taken once detained. Newsom called Trump's decision to deploy soldiers ""illegal"" and ""immoral"" and threatened to sue the administration. ""Donald Trump has created the conditions you see on your TV tonight... he's putting fuel on this fire,"" he said in an interview with MSNBC on Sunday evening as tensions flared. ""[It's] an unconstitutional act, and we're going to test that theory with a lawsuit tomorrow,"" Newsom added. Typically, a state's National Guard force is activated at the request of the governor. In this case, Trump has circumvented that step by invoking a specific provision of the US Code of Armed Services titled 10 U.S.C. 12406, which lists three circumstances under which the president can ""federalise"" the National Guard. Pockets of the city were thrown into chaos on Sunday night, with repeated bangs heard as police faced off with protesters.  Many of those involved were carrying Mexican flags or signs deriding federal immigration authorities, who arrested 118 unauthorised immigrants across LA on Friday - according to CBS, which cited information from ICE.   A row of self-driving Waymo vehicles - that serve as taxis in LA - had their tyres slashed, windows smashed and exteriors spray painted before they were torched by protesters.  Multiple patrol vehicles blocking a highway were damaged when protesters hurled objects - including E-scooters - at them. Fires were started across the city as protesters lit large fireworks. Several businesses reported looting late in the night, the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) said.  Many downtown streets were littered with debris, glass, cinder blocks and burn marks.  Buildings were covered in new graffiti, much of which contained graphic language against immigration enforcement.  In one particularly chaotic scene, a van driving erratically veered into a large group of protesters and appeared to hit several people. The driver, who was shirtless, was later arrested and police said he would face multiple charges. The same day, an Australian news reporter was filmed being struck by what appeared to be a rubber bullet fired by law enforcement. And a British photographer underwent emergency surgery after being struck in the leg by another non-lethal bullet. The BBC has asked the LAPD for comment. Police said they made 27 arrests, on top of the 29 on Saturday. Separately, at least 60 people were taken in at related protests in San Francisco. On his Truth Social platform on Sunday, Trump called for an end to the protests. In one post, he wrote: ""Looking really bad in L.A. BRING IN THE TROOPS!!!"" It is unclear which troops Trump was referring to as National Guard soldiers have already arrived, following his instruction. On Saturday evening, Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth threatened to activate the US Marine Corps if protests persisted.  He posted on X: ""Under President Trump, violence & destruction against federal agents & federal facilities will NOT be tolerated. It's COMMON SENSE. The @DeptofDefense is mobilizing the National Guard IMMEDIATELY to support federal law enforcement in Los Angeles. And, if violence continues, active duty Marines at Camp Pendleton will also be mobilized - they are on high alert."" Jose Barrera, the national vice president of the League of United Latin American citizens (LULAC), told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the White House wanted ""to create civic unrest"" in LA.  Barrera said there was ""no need"" for Trump to deploy the National Guard when there are 17,000 police personnel in the city.  He says deploying the troops ""increases tensions"" and confrontation, which set a ""dangerous precedent"". In a statement, the White House said that Trump ""rightfully stepped in to restore law and order because of Gavin Newsom's feckless leadership and his refusal to stop the violent attacks on American law enforcement"".

6/9/2025,Article,British photographer injured by 'plastic' bullet,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/cvg7vzrj6g3o,"A British news photographer has undergone emergency surgery after being hit by a non-lethal bullet while documenting the stand-off between police and protesters in the US city of Los Angeles. Nick Stern was covering the protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) on Sunday when he said a three-inch ""plastic bullet"" tore into his thigh. ""There was something hard sticking out of the back of my leg and my leg was getting wet from blood,"" he told the BBC. Demonstrations against immigration raids have been raging in LA for three days, with protests on Sunday erupting outside a Home Depot store in Paramount, south of LA. Stern, originally from Hertfordshire before relocating to the US in 2007, said he had been standing in the middle of the road all day taking photos when at 21:00 local time he was struck by a bullet. ""I suddenly got this terrific pain on my leg,"" he told the BBC's Three Counties Radio. ""I tried hobbling away [but] I couldn't put any weight on my leg."" He said that up to eight protesters rushed up to him to carry him away from the ""danger area"" before a medic cut his trousers off, put a pressure pad on the wound and tied a tourniquet.  ""From the moment I was hit I felt incredibly faint."" He is now recovering at Long Beach Memorial Medical Centre following emergency surgery to remove the bullet from his leg. Stern has a long history of covering protests and riots around the world and said he typically makes a point of being ""very deliberate and very obvious"".  ""I was out there wearing a press card around my neck, a big camera around my neck as well,"" he told the BBC. Despite his injury, Stern said he was eager to return to work.  ""I intend, as soon as I am well enough, to get back out there,"" he said. ""This is too important and it needs documenting."" An Australian journalist, Lauren Tomasi, was also struck by a non-lethal round, shot by a police officer, while filming a piece to camera in LA for 9 News. Since his return to the White House, US President Donald Trump has promised mass deportations of undocumented immigrants. Arrests made by ICE officers have increased during Trump's second term. Trump said he had deployed 2,000 National Guard troops to California to deal with the unrest over the immigration raids, saying the federal government would ""step in and solve the problem"". But the Democratic governor of California has appealed to Trump to pull National Guard units out of the city, accusing the White House of inflaming tensions.  Stern said: ""The communities in LA are very tight and very close-knit. ""So an outside organisation like ICE coming in and removing - whatever you want to call it, removing, kidnapping, abducting people from the community - is not going to go down well at all."" Stern said he had also sustained injuries after being hit by non-lethal rounds while covering protests in LA in 2020 in the aftermath of George Floyd's death. George Floyd - an unarmed Black man - was killed during an arrest by white police officer Derek Chauvin in 2020. Chauvin was sentenced to 22 years in jail for his murder. Copyright 2025 BBC.

6/9/2025,Article,Italy citizenship referendum: 'I was born here - but feel rejected',https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/c780yk3z2lyo,"Sonny Olumati was born in Rome and has lived in Italy all his life but the country he calls home does not recognise him as its own. To Italy, Sonny is Nigerian, like his passport, and the 39-year-old is only welcome as long as his latest residence permit. ""I've been born here. I will live here. I will die here,"" the dancer and activist tells me in what he calls ""macaroni"" Italian-English beneath the palm trees of a scruffy Roman park. ""But not having citizenship is like... being rejected from your country. And I don't think this is a feeling we should have"". That is why Sonny and others have been campaigning for a ""Yes"" vote in a national referendum on Sunday and Monday that proposes halving the time required to apply for Italian citizenship. Any children under 18 would automatically be naturalised along with their parents. Cutting the wait from 10 years to five would bring this country in line with most others in Europe and, proponents argue, improve integration. The referendum was initiated by a citizens' initiative and is supported by civil society groups. But for such a referendum to be valid, 50% of all voters in Italy have to turn up. Giorgia Meloni, the country's hard-right prime minister, has announced she will boycott the vote, declaring the citizenship law already ""excellent"" and ""very open"". Other parties allied to her are calling on Italians to go to the beach instead of the polling station. Sonny will not be taking part either. Without citizenship, he is not entitled to vote. The question of who gets to be Italian is a sensitive one. Large numbers of migrants and refugees arrive in the country each year helped across the Mediterranean from North Africa by smuggling gangs. Meloni's populist government has made a big deal about cutting the number of arrivals. But this referendum is aimed at those who have travelled legally for work to a country with a rapidly shrinking and ageing population. The aim is limited: to speed up the process for getting citizenship, not ease the strict criteria. ""Knowledge of the Italian language, not having criminal charges, continuous residence et cetera - all the various requirements remain the same,"" explains Carla Taibi of the liberal party More Europe, one of several backers of the referendum. The reform would affect long-term foreign residents already employed in Italy and their families: from those on factory production lines in the north to those caring for pensioners in plush Rome neighbourhoods. Up to 1.4 million people could qualify for citizenship immediately, with some estimates ranging higher. ""These people live in Italy, study and work and contribute. This is about changing the perception of them so they are not strangers anymore - but Italian,"" argues Taibi. The reform would also have practical implications. As a non-Italian, Sonny cannot apply for a public sector job, and even struggled to get a driving licence. When he was booked for hit reality TV show Fame Island last year, he ended up arriving two weeks late on set in Honduras because he had had so many problems getting the right paperwork. For a long time, Meloni ignored the referendum entirely. Italy's publicly owned media, run by a close Meloni ally, have also paid scant attention to the vote. There is no substantive ""No"" campaign, making it hard to have a balanced debate. But the real reason appears strategic. ""They don't want to raise awareness of the significance of the referendum,"" Professor Roberto D'Alimonte of Luiss University in Rome explains. ""That's rational, to make sure that the 50% threshold won't be reached."" The prime minister eventually announced she would turn up at a polling station ""to show respect for the ballot box"" - but refuse to cast a vote. ""When you disagree, you also have the option of abstaining,"" Meloni told a TV chat show this week, after critics accused her of disrespecting democracy. Italy's citizenship system was ""excellent"", she argued, already granting citizenship to more foreign nationals than most countries in Europe: 217,000 last year, according to the national statistics agency, Istat. But about 30,000 of those were Argentines with Italian ancestry on the other side of the world, unlikely even to visit. Meanwhile, Meloni's coalition partner, Roberto Vannacci of the far-right League, accused those behind the referendum of ""selling off our citizenship and erasing our identity"". I ask Sonny why he thinks his own application for citizenship has taken over two decades. ""It's racism,"" he replies immediately. At one point his file was lost completely, and he has now been told his case is ""pending"". ""We have ministers who talk about white supremacy - racial replacement of Italy,"" the activist recalls a 2023 comment by the agriculture minister from Meloni's own party.  ""They don't want black immigration and we know it. I was born here 39 years ago so I know what I say."" It is an accusation the prime minister has denied repeatedly.  Insaf Dimassi, 28, defines herself as ""Italian without citizenship"". ""Italy let me grow up and become the person I am today, so not being seen as a citizen is extremely painful and frustrating,"" she explains from the northern city of Bologna where she is studying for a PhD. Insaf's father travelled to Italy for work when she was a baby, and she and her mother then joined him. Her parents finally got Italian citizenship 20 days after Insaf turned 18. That meant she had to apply for herself from scratch, including proving a steady income. Insaf chose to study instead. ""I arrived here at nine months old, and maybe at 33 or 34 - if all goes well - I can finally be an Italian citizen,"" she says, exasperated. She remembers exactly when the significance of her ""outsider"" status hit home: it was when she was asked to run for election alongside a candidate for mayor in her hometown. When she shared the news with her parents, full of excitement, they had to remind her she was not Italian and was not eligible. ""They say it's a matter of meritocracy to be a citizen, that you have to earn it. But more than being myself, what do I have to demonstrate?"" Insaf wants to know. ""Not being allowed to vote, or be represented, is being invisible."" On the eve of the referendum, students in Rome wrote a call to the polls on the cobbles of a city square. ""Vote 'YES' on the 8th and 9th [of June],"" they spelled out in giant cardboard letters. With a government boycott and such meagre publicity, the chances of hitting the 50% turnout threshold seem slim. But Sonny argues that this vote is just the beginning. ""Even if they vote 'No', we will stay here - and think about the next step,"" he says. ""We have to start to talk about the place of our community in this country.""

6/9/2025,Article,South Korea cements cultural status with six Tonys for Maybe Happy Ending,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/cy0j71xgrv8o,"South Koreans are celebrating their first win in the Tony Awards, which they say highlights their country's status as a cultural powerhouse. The acclaimed Broadway production of Maybe Happy Ending, which debuted in South Korea almost a decade ago, won six Tonys, including best musical. Maybe Happy Ending is about the romance between two humanoid robots living in an apartment building on the outskirts of Seoul. It entered Sunday night's awards ceremony with 10 nominations. With the Tonys, South Koreans have now won the four most coveted awards in US entertainment. Squid Game won Emmy awards in 2022 while Parasite won four Oscars in 2020. Soprano Sumi Jo won a Grammy in 1993. On Sunday, South Korean lyricist Hue Park and American composer Will Aronson took home the Tony for best original score and best book of a musical. Before making their Broadway debut with Maybe Happy Ending in 2024, the pair, who met as students at New York University, had written the musical in both English and Korean. ""This is amazing!"" one post on Threads reads. ""I heard the Broadway version got even more polished. I'm so proud that Korea is becoming a true cultural powerhouse."" ""This feels like a dream come true for the Korean Wave,"" reads another post. ""I'm just as thrilled as when Parasite won the Oscars, Squid Game won the Emmys, and Han Kang received the Nobel Prize."" Former Glee star Darren Criss, who played one of the robots, Oliver, won best lead actor in a musical. It was his first Tony win. The musical, which also stars Helen J Shen as robot Claire, was already on a streak this awards season. It bagged some of the top prizes at the Outer Critics Circle Awards and Drama League Awards this year. First directed by Kim Dong-yeon, Maybe Happy Ending premiered in Seoul in 2016 to much critical acclaim. It has since been revived several times in South Korea and abroad - in both Korean and English. Maybe Happy Ending's success comes as South Korean artists continue to break ground in entertainment, especially with K-pop acts like BTS and Blackpink dominating music in the last few years. It also serves as a window into Korean culture, some social media users say. ""It's amazing that Korean elements like Jeju Island, fireflies, and hwabun (a plant pot) were kept in the Broadway version too,"" reads one post on Threads.  ""I already felt proud just seeing it nominated, but watching the local audience react so positively made it even more special."" Copyright 2025 BBC.

6/9/2025,Article,Britain's energy bills problem - and why firms are paid huge sums for unwanted power,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/cdedjnw8e85o,"It is 1am on 3 June. A near gale force wind is blasting into Scotland. Great weather for the Moray East and West offshore wind farms, you would have thought. The two farms are 13 miles off the north-east coast of Scotland and include some of the biggest wind turbines in the UK, at 257m high. With winds like that they should be operating at maximum capacity, generating what the developer, Ocean Winds, claims is enough power to meet the electricity needs of well over a million homes. Except they are not. That's because if you thought that once an electricity generator - whether it be a wind farm or a gas-powered plant - was connected to the national grid it could seamlessly send its electricity wherever it was needed in the country, you'd be wrong. The electricity grid was built to deliver power generated by coal and gas plants near the country's major cities and towns, and doesn't always have sufficient capacity in the wires that carry electricity around the country to get the new renewable electricity generated way out in the wild seas and rural areas. And this has major consequences. The way the system currently works means a company like Ocean Winds gets what are effectively compensation payments if the system can't take the power its wind turbines are generating and it has to turn down its output. It means Ocean winds was paid £72,000 not to generate power from its wind farms in the Moray Firth during a half-hour period on 3 June because the system was overloaded - one of a number of occasions output was restricted that day. At the same time, 44 miles (70km) east of London, the Grain gas-fired power station on the Thames Estuary was paid £43,000 to provide more electricity. Payments like that happen virtually every day. Seagreen, Scotland's largest wind farm, was paid £65 million last year to restrict its output 71% of the time, according to analysis by Octopus Energy.  Balancing the grid in this way has already cost the country more than £500 million this year alone, the company's analysis shows. The total could reach almost £8bn a year by 2030, warns the National Electricity System Operator (NESO), the body in charge of the electricity network. It's pushing up all our energy bills and calling into question the government's promise that net zero would end up delivering cheaper electricity. Now, the government is considering a radical solution: instead of one big, national electricity market, there'll be a number of smaller regional markets, with the government gambling that this could make the system more efficient and deliver cheaper bills. But in reality, it's not guaranteed that anyone will get cheaper bills. And even if some people do, many others elsewhere in the country could end up paying more. The proposals have sparked such bitter debate that one senior energy industry executive called it ""the most vicious policy fight"" he has ever known. He has, he says, ""lost friends"" over it. Meanwhile, political opponents who claim net zero is an expensive dead end are only too ready to pounce. It is reported that the Prime Minister has asked to review the details of what some newspapers are calling a ""postcode pricing"" plan. So is the government really ready to risk the most radical shake-up of the UK electricity market since privatisation 35 years ago? And what will it really mean for our bills? The Energy Secretary, Ed Miliband, is certainly in a fix. His net zero policy is under attack like never before. The Tories have come out against it, green politicians say it isn't delivering for ordinary people, and even Tony Blair has weighed in against it. Meanwhile Reform UK has identified the policy as a major Achilles heel for the Labour government. ""The next election will be fought on two issues, immigration and net stupid zero,"" says Reform's deputy leader Richard Tice. ""And we are going to win."" Poll after poll says cost of living is a much more important for most people, and people often specifically cite concerns about rising energy prices. Miliband sold his aggressive clean energy policies in part on cutting costs. He said that ensuring 95% of the country's electricity comes from low-carbon sources by 2030 would slash the average electricity bill by £300. But the potential for renewables to deliver lower costs just isn't coming through to consumers.  Renewables now generate more than half the country's electricity, but because of the limits to how much electricity can be moved around the system, even on windy days some gas generation is almost always needed to top the system up.  And because gas tends to be more expensive, it sets the wholesale price. Supporters of the government's plan argue that, as long as prices continue to be set at a national level, the hold gas has on the cost of electricity will be hard to break. Less so with regional – or, in the jargon, ""zonal"" - pricing. Think of Scotland, blessed with vast wind resources but just 5.5 million people. The argument goes that if prices were set locally, it wouldn't be necessary to pay wind farms to be turned down because there wasn't enough capacity in the cables to carry all the electricity into England.  On a windy day like 3 June, they would have to sell that spare power to local people instead of into a national market. The theory is prices would fall dramatically – on some days Scottish customers might even get their electricity for free. Other areas with lots of renewable power - such as Yorkshire and the North East, as well as parts of Wales - would stand to benefit too. And, as solar investment increases in Lincolnshire and other parts of the east of England, they could also see prices tumble. All that cheap power could also transform the economics of industry. Supporters argue that it would attract energy-intensive businesses such as data centres, chemical companies and other manufacturing industries. In London and much of the south of England, the price of electricity would sometimes be higher than in the windy north. But supporters say some of the hundreds of millions of pounds the system would save could be used to make sure no one pays more than they do now. And those higher prices could also encourage investors to build new wind farms and solar plants closer to where the demand is. The argument is that would lower prices in the long run and bring another benefit - less electricity would need to be carried around the country, so we would need fewer new pylons, saving everyone money and meaning less clutter in the countryside. ""Zonal pricing would make the energy system as a whole dramatically more efficient, slashing this waste and cutting bills for every family and business in the country,"" argues Greg Jackson, the CEO of Octopus Energy, one of the biggest energy suppliers in the UK. Research commissioned by the company estimates the savings could top £55 billion by 2050 - which it claims could knock £50 to £100 a year off the average bill. Octopus points out Sweden made the switch to regional pricing in just 18 months. The supporters of regional pricing include NESO, Citizens Advice and the head of the energy regulator, Ofgem. Last week a committee of the House of Lords recommended the country should switch to the system. There are, however, many businesses involved in building and running renewable energy plants that oppose the move. ""We're making billions of pounds of investments in renewable power in the UK every year,"" says Tom Glover, the UK chair of the giant German power company RWE. ""I can't go to my board and say let's take a bet on billions of pounds of investment."" He's worried changing the way energy is priced could undermine contracts and make revenues more uncertain. And he says it risks undermining the government's big push to switch to green energy. The main cost of wind and solar plants is in the build. It means the price of the energy they produce is very closely tied to the cost of building and, because developers borrow most of the money, that means the interest rates they are charged. And we are talking a lot of money. The government is expecting power companies to spend £40bn pounds a year over the next five years on renewable projects in the UK.  Glover says even a very small change in interest rates could have dramatic effects on how much renewable infrastructure is built and how much the power from it costs. ""Those additional costs could quickly overwhelm any of the benefits of regional pricing,"" says Stephen Woodhouse, an economist with the consultancy firm AFRY, which has studied the impact of regional pricing for the power companies. That would come as already high interest rates have combined with rising prices for steel and other materials to push up the cost of renewables. Plans for a huge wind farm off the coast of Yorkshire were cancelled last month because the developer said it no longer made economic sense. And there's another consideration, he says. The National Grid, which owns the pylons, substations and cables that move electricity around the country, is already rolling out a huge investment programme – some £60bn over the next five years - to upgrade the system ready for the new world of clean power.  That new infrastructure will mean more capacity to bring electricity from our windy northern coasts down south, and therefore also mean fewer savings from a regional pricing system in the future. There are other arguments too. Critics warn introducing regional pricing could take years, that energy-intensive businesses like British Steel can't just up sticks and move, and that the system will be unfair because some customers will pay more than others. But according to Greg Jackson of Octopus, the power companies and their backers just want to protect their profits. ""Unsurprisingly, it's the companies that enjoy attractive returns from this absurd system who are lobbying hard to maintain the status quo,"" he says. Yet the power companies say Octopus has a vested interest too. It is the UK's biggest energy supplier with some seven million customers, and owns a sophisticated billing system it licenses to other suppliers, so could gain from changes to the way electricity is priced, they claim. And the clock is ticking. Whether the government meets its clean power targets will depend on how many new wind farms and solar plants are built.  The companies who will build them say they need certainty around the future of the electricity market, so a decision must be taken soon. It's expected in the next couple of weeks.

6/9/2025,Article,Kenya police barred from work after man dies in custody ,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/cwy3eqpqqnzo,"Kenyan police officers who were on duty when a man died in custody at a police station have been barred from returning to work pending the outcome of investigations.  Albert Ojwang was arrested on Friday after Kenya's deputy police chief accused him of tarnishing his name, police Inspector-General Douglas Kanja confirmed. ""While in custody, the suspect sustained head injuries after hitting his head against a cell wall,"" a police statement said. He was rushed to hospital ""where he was pronounced dead on arrival"". The director of Amnesty International's Kenya branch told the BBC that  Mr Ojwang's death was ""very suspicious"". Amnesty said in a statement that it ""raises serious questions that must be urgently, thoroughly, and independently investigated"". Senior police officer Stephen Okal is quoted by the Star newspaper as saying what happened in the cell was ""an attempted suicide"". Mr Ojwang, described in media reports as a teacher and blogger, was arrested in the western town of Homa Bay and then driven 350km (220 miles) to the capital, Nairobi, his father Meshack Opiyo told journalists. He had been accused of ""false publication"",with Mr Opiyo telling online news site Citizen Digital that the arresting police officer said ""Albert had insulted a senior person on X"", the social media platform. A police statement said the officers who were on duty at the time - including the head of the police station - were ""interdicted"" to allow Kenya's independent oversight body to conduct an ""impartial investigation"". This meant that the officers could not perform their duties, and would receive half their salaries, pending the outcome of the investigation, police spokesman Michael Muchiri told the BBC. Speaking at a press conference, Mr Kanja said the police would give the investigators all ""necessary support"" to resolve the case. He said Mr Ojwang was arrested in Homa Bay on Friday, then transferred to Nairobi for questioning and booked at the police station on Saturday. According to the police chief, Mr Ojwang was found unconscious during a routine inspection of the cells, and was taken to a hospital where he was pronounced dead on arrival. He said the arrest had been prompted by a complaint by deputy police chief Eliud Lagat ""about his name being tarnished"". ""It was on that basis that investigations were actually being carried out,"" the police chief added. The head of the Independent Police Oversight Commission (Ipoa), Ahmed Isaack Hassan, has said his team will do ""everything to ensure justice is served for the family and for all Kenyans"".  Mr Hassan, who attended the press conference, called on officers not to interfere with the investigations. A post-mortem examination was scheduled to be carried out on Monday. The death of Mr Ojwang, who was reported to have been 31, has sparked outrage online and calls for protests to demand police accountability. Referring to the circumstances of his arrest, Amnesty Kenya director Irungu Houghton said it was ""quite shocking"" that Mr Ojwang was not booked in at the local police station after being detained, but was instead taken on a long journey. He called on the independent investigators to secure what he described as ""the crime scene"" at the police station in Nairobi. Ojwang's detention and death comes at a time of rising concern about how some government critics are being treated.  Last week, software developer Rose Njeri - who created a tool to help people oppose a government finance bill - was charged with violating a cybercrime law.
