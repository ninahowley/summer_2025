Discussion:The findings indicate that the proposed framework significantly decreases energy consumption, enhances resource usage, and guarantees low-latency actuation in Agri-IoT implementations. The proposed work provides a scalable and intelligent system for real-time, energy-efficient agricultural monitoring. **1 Introduction** Modern agriculture faces growing pressure to satisfy global food requirements, enhance sustainability, and adjust to constrained resources. In addition, it promotes sustainable farming methods and addresses the shortage of resources (Jararweh et al., 2023). The growing population and shifting climate increase the pressure on traditional farming practices. This calls for a paradigm change in favor of more environmentally friendly and resilient methods (Wakweya, 2023). The complex interactions between these problems have spurred research in smart agriculture. Technology is driving the novel and revolutionary concept of \u201csmart agriculture,\u201d which aims to reduce environmental impact, improve operational effectiveness, and maximize resource use. Smart agriculture, as opposed to traditional methods, incorporates cutting-edge solutions to build an agricultural environment that is more data-driven and networked (Vishnoi and Goel, 2024). This paradigm seeks to reduce the ecological footprint left by conventional farming practices to promote sustainability, in addition to increasing agricultural productivity. Conventional agricultural practices are inadequate to satisfy the demands of an expanding population under evolving climatic conditions. IoT-based sensing solutions provide a scalable, data-driven solution for real-time environmental monitoring. One of the most important initial steps in creating an intelligent and networked ecosystem is the use of IoT (Internet of Things) in agriculture. The deployment of a surveillance system based on the Internet of Things aims to revolutionize farmers\u2019 data collection and utilization. To gather vital data for precise decision-making in smart agriculture, it focuses on carefully placing sensors and communication devices throughout agricultural infrastructure. The IoT-based monitoring system provides farmers with real-time data, allowing them to make informed decisions about energy use, soil moisture, and atmospheric conditions. This information can help improve resource allocation, streamline operations, and boost efficiency. The technology also allows for more adaptable and responsive agricultural practices, such as improved energy management and precise irrigation methods. By providing farmers with real-time insights into soil moisture levels, the Internet of Things (IoT)-based monitoring system enables resource optimization and promotes sustainable agricultural practices, equipping them with the information needed to make informed decisions (Liu, 2022). Allocating resources, such as time, energy, bandwidth, and processing capacity, to conflicting needs is an essential procedure. Many industries, such as energy management, manufacturing processes, transportation networks, and communication systems, depend on the efficient allocation of resources (Sun et al., 2020). Resource allocation is important in wireless sensor network (WSN)-based agriculture systems since available resources are characteristically restricted and sensor energy consumption must be reduced to increase network lifetime. Several benefits, including improved system performance, lower energy usage, increased dependability, and improved scalability, can result from optimal resource allocation. In agri-IoT networks, efficient resource allocation is essential for maintaining system scalability, lowering latency, and ensuring energy economy. Numerous techniques, such as heuristic, optimization, reinforcement learning, and clustering-based approaches, have been put forth for this goal. Clustering techniques such as threshold-sensitive energy-efficient (TEEN) network, hybrid energy-efficient distributed (HEED) clustering, and low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy (LEACH) are frequently used to rotate roles among sensor nodes and aggregate data, thereby increasing network\u2019s lifetime (Daanoune et al., 2021;Jabbar et al., 2023;Daanoune et al., 2021;Jabbar et al., 2023). To effectively schedule sensing tasks, optimize routing paths, and manage energy resources, optimization-based metaheuristics such as ant colony optimization (ACO), particle swarm optimization (PSO) (Prakash et al., 2024), genetic algorithms (GAs), gray wolf optimizer (GWO), and whale optimization algorithm (WOA) (Chandrasekaran and Rajasekaran, 2024) have been used. For tasks such as irrigation and scheduling sensors, methods such as Q-learning, deep Q-networks (DQNs), and multi-agent RL help make smart decisions in changing situations (Ganesh et al., 2023,Zhao et al., 2022). In less complex situations, rule-based approaches such as round-robin procedures and priority scheduling are employed for load balancing and job ordering. Together, these algorithms enable scalable, adaptive, and intelligent resource management in smart agriculture systems. According to recent studies, combining optimization techniques with predictive modeling greatly enhances resource allocation in agri-IoT systems. Numerous deep learning and machine learning models have been used to predict environmental factors and maximize the use of scarce agricultural resources. For example, IoT-based frameworks have employed convoluted neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) models to forecast agricultural diseases and insect outbreaks, allowing for the timely administration of pesticides and lowering the use of chemicals (Wang et al., 2024). To promote accurate irrigation and minimize water waste, models such as random forest, XGBoost, and LSTM have been used to forecast weather and soil moisture (Li et al., 2023). Optimal irrigation strategies that balance crop water requirements and energy consumption have been learned using deep reinforcement learning approaches such as DQNs. Additionally, simple scheduling methods have been combined with bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) models to predict future soil moisture levels and enhance control over irrigation cycles. These methods show how prediction-driven, context-aware decision-making is increasingly being used in smart agriculture to maximize the use of energy, water, and chemical resources, eventually fostering cost-effectiveness and sustainability. The following justifies the use of optimization in the proposed Bi-LSTM model: \u2022 Resource allocation in agri-IoT systems within WSNs necessitates the creation of scalable, robust, and dependable deep learning models. \u2022 The Bi-LSTM model comprises numerous hyperparameters that substantially influence its predictive efficiency. Consequently, optimizing these hyperparameters is essential for enhancing accuracy and efficiency. The primary contributions of this work are as follows: \u2022 The proposed model (Bi-LSTM\u2013ACO) is trained using time-series data collected from an agricultural field, with the dataset obtained through a real-time embedded sensor system that is positioned in the field. \u2022 A new optimization technique based on the behavior of certain animals is being offered in order to utilize the power of sensor devices positioned inside the wireless sensor network. Ant colony optimization is a method used to tackle complex problems, which draws inspiration from nature. \u2022 To solve the specific challenges of resource allocation such as the utilization of power and optimization of energy in IoT networks, a novel Bi-LSTM\u2013ACO methodology is proposed. \u2022 This methodology addresses the crucial problem of resource allocation in Internet of Things networks by efficiently distributing resources to IoT applications and devices according to different priorities and needs. The previous work explains the contributions of various authors, which are discussed inSection 2along with the proposed Bi-LSTM with ACO algorithm. The analysis of model performance and the results are presented inSection 3(Results and Discussion). Finally, the discussion and summary are provided inSection 4(Conclusion). **2 Related work** Energy efficiency and predictive intelligence in smart agriculture have emerged as vital research domains owing to the growing use of WSNs and IoT-enabled devices. Conventional approaches often fail to inadequately address the dynamic management of power consumption and the accurate forecasting of energy usage in these systems. Recent studies have investigated hybrid models and optimization methods to mitigate these limitations. A joint optimization approach using deep reinforcement learning for the management of power and channel allocation in agricultural wireless sensor networks was suggested byHan et al. (2021). The network control issue is formulated as a Markov decision process and addressed by deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG), resulting in enhanced network rewards and energy equilibrium under SINR constraints. A hybrid LSTM\u2013GRU architecture was proposed byRahman et al. (2024)for real-time environmental and electricity forecasting in IoT systems. The integration of both models substantially diminished prediction errors, yielding an MAE of 3.78% and an RMSE of 8.15%, hence providing enhanced reliability compared to individual LSTM or GRU models. To tackle privacy concerns in distributed IoT settings,Sharma and Kaur (2024)introduced a fog-based federated learning framework for time-series prediction. The solution sustained performance equivalence with centralized models despite non-IID data distributions while safeguarding user data privacy and minimizing network traffic. In the field of building energy prediction,Wang et al. (2025)introduced the BE-LSTM model, which integrates backward elimination (BE) with LSTM for efficient forecasting on limited datasets. The method surpassed CNN\u2013LSTM and Bi-LSTM models, especially in contexts featuring non-periodic human behavior patterns. Tace et al. (2022)introduced a hybrid deep learning model that combines CNN with a multi-layer bidirectional LSTM (M-BDLSTM) for short-term home energy consumption prediction. The model exhibited enhanced accuracy with reduced RMSE and MSE across various validation methods, confirming its efficacy for practical application. A hybrid optimization technique called the EAO and an enhanced CNN are suggested by the clustering algorithm to boost training accuracy and precision. The methodology achieves better results than current methods with a 99% packet delivery ratio, 76.92% throughput, 98.24% network lifetime, 50% maximum energy consumption, and 99.23% classification accuracy (Pandiyaraju et al., 2023). Vashisht et al. (2024)proposed a GRU\u2013Bi-LSTM model for crop yield prediction, integrating data preprocessing, an improved shearlet transform for feature extraction, and enhanced gray wolf optimization for feature selection. The hybrid model attained a high accuracy of 97% and demonstrated robust performance in precision, recall, and F-measure, surpassing conventional techniques. This underscores its efficacy in improving precision agriculture via precise yield forecasts. Ullah et al. introduced a hybrid deep learning framework that integrates CNNs with M-BDLSTM for the prediction of short-term residential energy consumption. The model incorporates data preparation, sequential learning, and comparing prediction phases. It adeptly captures temporal trends and enhances forecasting precision, surpassing conventional models by reducing prediction errors such as MSE and RMSE, as proven by 10-fold cross-validation and hold-out techniques (Ullah et al., 2020). Tace et al. devised an intelligent irrigation system utilizing IoT and machine learning to enhance water efficiency in agriculture. Through the integration of environmental sensors (humidity, temperature, and precipitation) with models such as KNN, SVM, and neural networks, and the deployment of the system utilizing Node-RED and MongoDB, they attained precise, cost-effective, and adaptable irrigation management. The KNN model surpassed others with an accuracy of 98.3% and a low RMSE, illustrating the promise of ML\u2013IoT integration in precision irrigation (Tace et al., 2022). Liu et al. (2024)tackled the issue of improving Bi-LSTM hyperparameters for short-term power load forecasting by introducing a hybrid differential evolution\u2013improved Harris hawk optimization (DE\u2013IHHO) approach. This method improves the global search efficacy and convergence rate of Bi-LSTM training by integrating evolutionary and metaheuristic techniques. The results demonstrated significant enhancements in MAE, MAPE, and RMSE parameters, confirming the model\u2019s efficacy for dynamic load forecasting in smart grid applications. Mbamba and Batstone (2023)created a genetic algorithm-driven optimization framework for deep learning models in the water sector. The research combines feature selection methodologies (PCC, PCA, and GA) with Bi-LSTM networks to forecast effluent quality and biogas generation. The findings indicate that shallow network designs with optimized hyperparameters yield efficient, interpretable, and precise forecasts, rendering this technique appropriate for multi-objective optimization and predictive analytics in environmental systems. Mustaffa et al. (2024)introduced a hybrid forecasting model for Earth\u2019s surface temperature prediction utilizing deep learning and optimized with the Barnacles Mating Optimizer (BMO). The model optimizes both weights and biases to improve predictive accuracy on a global temperature dataset. Compared to other optimization methods such as PSO, HSA, ACO, and traditional ARIMA, the BMO-optimized deep learning model exhibited enhanced performance in terms of MAE, RMSE, and R2, underscoring its efficacy for climate-sensitive applications, including agriculture and meteorology. These studies underscore the increasing implementation of deep learning, metaheuristic optimization, and decentralized learning frameworks in time-series forecasting and energy management. Nonetheless, a research gap persists in the application of these approaches to real-time agri-IoT systems featuring multivariate sensor\u2013actuator feedback. This study tackles the existing gap by employing an integrated Bi-LSTM\u2013ACO model designed for energy-efficient scheduling and resource optimization in agricultural sensor networks. The proposed agri-IoT wireless sensor network system depends on several factors, including node placement, hardware status, and dynamic power consumption. To ensure energy-efficient communication, it is critical to develop a strategy that ensures sufficient energy to complete tasks effectively. The goal of this integrated approach is to improve communication reliability and energy efficiency inside the agricultural IoT network.Figure 1depicts the total system architecture. There are several sensor nodes in the agricultural field that are used to read data. The sensor node, used to monitor the agricultural field and perform necessary measures, such as controlling the water pump, consists of various sensors including those for temperature, humidity, and soil moisture. Figure 1. Overall proposed system architecture. The sensor data are sent to the IoT cloud. The dataset consists of sensor values, actuator state, and power consumption of the sensor node. The deep neural network model, Bi-LSTM with ACO, is used to determine the power consumption and energy optimization of the sensor nodes using a trained dataset. In this context, we have introduced a comprehensive approach that incorporates Z-score normalization for preprocessing; particle swarm optimization is used for feature selection, and principal component analysis (PCA) is used for feature extraction. **2.1 Dataset preparation** A real-time dataset was generated using a custom-built embedded system to facilitate predictive energy optimization in the agri-IoT setting. The system consisted of a collection of environmental sensors combined with a microcontroller and linked to a cloud dashboard for ongoing data capture and logging. The sensor suite comprised a DHT11 for temperature and humidity measurement, a capacitive soil moisture sensor, and a water level sensor for irrigation monitoring. The sensors were connected to a Node MCU ESP8266 microcontroller that was chosen for its integrated Wi-Fi functionality and energy-efficient performance, which is ideal for IoT applications. The system intermittently collected environmental parameters and actuator states (e.g., water pump ON/OFF) and relayed the gathered data to a cloud-based IoT platform for storage and analysis. The dataset was created by recording time-stamped sensor readings and the associated power consumption values computed for each sensor transmission cycle. The cloud platform offered an API interface for accessing historical records, which was subsequently utilized for model training and assessment. **2.2 Preprocessing: Z-score data normalization** Z-score normalization (standardization) is used on the dataset to guarantee scale consistency and enhance the prediction model\u2019s efficacy. Time, latency, temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and pump status are among the features included in the collection. The data formats include strings, integers, floats, and possibly missing (NaN) values. First, a uniform numerical representation is created by cleaning and converting these numbers. When feature variables have different magnitudes or units (such as temperature in degrees Celsius versus humidity in %), Z-score normalization is particularly helpful. It helps the Bi-LSTM model learn more effectively by transforming the data so that each feature has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. The Z-score normalization for temperature data pointxtiis calculated using theEquation 1: Here, This standardization ensures that each input feature contributes proportionally to the model\u2019s learning process and improves convergence during training. **2.3 Feature extraction: PCA** PCA is a statistical method for reducing dimensionality while maintaining the greatest amount of data variation. It converts the initial correlated characteristics into principal components, which are a collection of linearly uncorrelated variables. These elements stand for the directions along which the data variance is maximized in the feature space. In multivariate sensor data, such as temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and actuator status included in agri-IoT datasets, PCA helps simplify feature space complexity while maintaining important predictive information. Equation 2shows that the mean\u03bctdepends on temperature data input valuesxti, wherei=1,2,\u2026.Mrepresent stochastic m-dimensional sensor data: Equation 3expresses the covariance matrix with inputxtias follows: PCA proceeds by solving the eigenvalue problem of the covariance matrix as shown inEquation 4: wherevi\u2212eigenvectors,i=1,2,\u2026\u2026,mand To use low-dimensional vectors to describe data records, we create m eigenvectors, also called principal directions, which correspond to the n highest eigenvalues. Using this approach, we can identify the directions along which the data differ the most. These principal directions are critical for efficient dimensionality reduction and analysis since the variance of the input data predictions along these directions is known to be higher than along any other direction. The matrix of eigenvectors is formed as defined inEquation 5. The relationship between the eigenvectors and eigenvalues is expressed inEquation 6. Equation 8defines the threshold condition for retaining the top principal components. A new input dataset, y, is assigned a low-dimensional feature vector using the given equations to calculate how many eigenvectors to choose based on a precision value, v, that has been selected. This procedure significantly reduces the dimensionality while preserving the highest degree of variation in the recovered features. The transformed dataset using principal components is computed usingEquation 8. **2.4 Feature selection: PSO** PSO is a nature-inspired metaheuristic method employed to address intricate optimization challenges. This study utilizes PSO as a feature selection technique to discern the most pertinent properties from the agri-IoT dataset, thereby minimizing dimensionality and enhancing the efficacy of the subsequent Bi-LSTM prediction model. PSO commences with the initialization of a population (swarm) of particles, each representing a potential solution (a subset of characteristics). The particles iteratively adjust their placements in the feature space, influenced by their individual optimal experiences (pbest) and the global optimal solution identified by the swarm (gbest). The velocity of each particle is updated according toEquations 9,10determines the new position of each particle based on its velocity. Here, The inertia weight (w) decreases linearly with iterations using the maximum and minimum constraints (wmaxandwmin) and is described as follows: Particles\u2019 velocity and position updates guide the swarm\u2019s cognitive and social paradigms through the search space. PSO can address complicated engineering optimization issues, but it often results in premature convergence due to local entrapment. **2.5 Bi-LSTM** Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with LSTM are ideal for sequential input applications because of their long-term dependency understanding capabilities. The three primary components of their gate structure that normalize the information flow are the input gate, forget gate, and output gate. The forget gate uses a sigmoid function in conjunction with a tanh function to determine which data in the memory cell should be deleted or retained. These features are also used by the input gate to control when fresh data are added to the memory cell. Using a sigmoid function, the output gate chooses the data that will have an impact on the current output.Figure 2shows the LSTM architecture. Figure 2. Architecture of LSTM The forget gate in the cell\u2019s gating mechanism initially determines which data should be removed from the neural network\u2019s state. It processes the up-to-date involvement (xt) and earlier outputht\u22121when in the stateCt\u22121. The result has a range of 0\u20131, where 1 represents total information retention and 0 represents total information elimination.Equation 12provides a comprehensive computational formula. The next stage involves determining which new data should be retained in the neural network. This phase has two components: a tanh function generates a candidate vector state,Nt, which can be added to the cell state, and a sigmoid layer, known as the \u201cinput gate,\u201d determines which values to update first. The computational formulas for this process are presented inEquations 13,14. Here,WiandWn\u2212weightmetricsofinputandinputcandidateents,respectively. Updating the cell state from the earlier cell state,Ct\u22121, to the current cell state, Ct, is the third step. The computational formula is presented inEquation 15, whereNt\u00d7gtirepresents the new candidate value and Ct\u2212 1 \u00d7gtidetermines which information of the old unit status is stored. The last stage involves determining the LSTM\u2019s output. The output of the sigmoid threshold is obtained by multiplying the unit state\u2019s tanh value with the output of the sigmoid layer, which first decides which unit states should be output. This normalizes the output value and yields the new unit state of the output. The computational equations are displayed inEquations 16,17. Here, An extension of the LSTM neural network, a Bi-LSTM network, is developed to gather data in sequential input from both past and future contexts. The traditional LSTM network is used to calculate sequence data step by step in chronological order, from front to rear. However, there are times when the sequence\u2019s backward dependency relationship, that is, the potential for a one-time step\u2019s outcome to potentially affect subsequent time steps, becomes rather significant. The inverse layer of the Bi-LSTM network was added to enable bidirectional scanning to solve this problem.Figure 3illustrates the diagram of Bi-LSTM. Figure 3. Bi-LSTM architecture. Bi-LSTM consists of two LSTM layers, one forward and one reverse. Combinations of hidden states in both directions can be passed into subsequent layers to extract temporal information.Equation 20describes data as a result of concatenating the forward (left-to-right) and backward (right-to-left) hidden states in the Bi-LSTM output. The final hidden state is computed usingEquations 18,19and the forward and backward hidden states are combined as shown inEquation 20. Here,xt\u2212inputdataofthesource. **2.6 Ant colony optimization** The ACO-based approach functions as follows. An ant could see every neuronal connection in a theoretically fully linked bidirectional long short-term memory network as a potential path, with each node capable of connecting to every other node in the succeeding layer and to a corresponding node in the recurrent layer. The master process records the pheromone quantity of each connection and initializes each potential connection with a base pheromone. A chosen number of ants are given neural network designs to use in worker processes, which then ask them to pick a path across the fully linked neural network that is skewed by the quantity of pheromone on each connection. Several ants can choose the neuronal connections. Once these ant paths are integrated, the resulting neural network design is distributed to worker processes for training using methods such as backpropagation, evolutionary algorithms, or other neural network training techniques on the given flight data. The master process manages a population of the best neural network designs. If a worker reports that the accuracy of a newly trained neural network surpasses the existing population, the pheromone levels on the corresponding links within the neural network are increased. Similar to the standard ACO algorithm, the master process continuously reduces pheromone levels over time. This approach facilitates the creation of recurrent neural networks with multiple hidden layers and nodes, enabling the identification of optimal designs for predicting flight characteristics. To balance computational cost and enhance the accuracy of Bi-LSTM, this study combines ACO with Bi-LSTM. The Bi-LSTM model is optimized in the proposed method by adjusting its parameters and allocating resources more effectively using ACO. The Bi-LSTM network processes input data both forward and backward to forecast sequential data patterns such as energy use and resource requirements. However, the network\u2019s parameters (such as weights, biases, and hyperparameters) must be adjusted to attain the best possible performance. By mimicking the behavior of ants searching for the shortest paths, each of which could be a potential solution for configuring the Bi-LSTM model, ACO improves this process. The ACO algorithm iteratively modifies pheromone levels to direct the search toward optimal solutions after evaluating these paths according to a performance criterion such as prediction accuracy or energy efficiency. ACO makes certain that the Bi-LSTM model achieves increased accuracy, lower energy consumption, and minimal latency by dynamically modifying parameters and identifying efficient pathways. An optimized model that can provide better forecasts and resource management in smart agriculture is produced by combining ACO with Bi-LSTM. The flow diagram shows how the ACO algorithm (seeFigure 4) and the Bi-LSTM neural network are integrated for resource optimization and performance enhancement. Initializing the Bi-LSTM parameters and pheromone levels for ACO is the first step in the procedure. The number of ants (agents) needed to investigate the possible paths (solutions) is decided by the ACO algorithm. Pheromone trails and solution quality are used by worker procedures to assess the routes. The Bi-LSTM neural network is then trained using the optimized routes, which enhances its prediction accuracy. Iteratively, the solutions are improved by updating the pheromone levels and assessing the trained network\u2019s performance. The population of solutions grows across several iterations, improving system performance, forecast accuracy, and resource allocation. To achieve effective and high-performing results, this hybrid approach combines the sequential data processing capacity of Bi-LSTM with the optimization capabilities of ACO. Figure 4. Flow diagram of the ACO optimizer. The below pseudo code shows the algorithm steps for combining Bi LSTM with the ACO optimizer.

The Bi-LSTM model captures complex temporal dependencies in multivariate sensor data, enabling the precise forecasting of environmental conditions and optimal scheduling of actuator responses such as irrigation. This predictive capability reduces unnecessary activations, conserving energy and water. Simultaneously, ACO is employed to fine-tune Bi-LSTM hyperparameters and optimize sensor operation schedules, allowing dynamic adjustment of sensing intervals and communication paths based on energy trends. Specifications for the hyperparameters for the proposed model are discussed inTable 1. The incorporation of PCA and PSO during preprocessing further minimizes computational overhead by selecting only the most relevant features, thereby lowering bandwidth and power consumption. By leveraging real-time sensor\u2013actuator feedback and adaptive control strategies, the framework provides a scalable and context-aware solution for efficient resource management. Overall, this research offers a robust and intelligent approach to sustainable agriculture through optimized use of energy, bandwidth, and sensing resources. Table 1. Hyperparameters of the proposed model. Temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and pump status are just a few of the parameters that the system collects and periodically updates on the Adafruit IO cloud. The data collection process generates a considerable dataset that can be used in downstream deep learning applications to improve the efficiency and decision-making of farming techniques. The integration of these technologies highlights the potential for improved energy efficiency and optimal power resource management in smart farming. **3.1 Performance metrics** Accuracy is defined as the proportion of all accurate estimates the classification model makes compared to the total number of test samples. The accuracy of the model is calculated as perEquation 21. The definition of precision is the ratio of the classification model\u2019s anticipated true positive values to the total of its true and false positives. The precision metric is computed usingEquation 22. The ratio of the classification model\u2019s predicted true positive values to the total of its true positive and false negative values should be remembered. The recall is calculated using theEquation 23. The F1 score is the hormonal mean of the classification model\u2019s recall and precision. The F1-score is calculated as shown inEquation 24. The training and validation losses of the dataset were monitored to assess the performance of the Bi-LSTM model optimized with ACO during the analysis. These loss measures reveal information about how well the model is learning from the data in bits, as illustrated inFigure 5. The training and validation losses show a distinct trend that demonstrates how well the Bi-LSTM with ACO optimization reduces mistakes and enhances overall model performance. Figure 5. Training loss of the proposed deep learning model (Bi-LSTM\u2013ACO). Additionally, each class evaluated a trained model to assess the model\u2019s performance. Every job included in the verification set was tested. The number of quantities in each class that were correctly predicted is displayed in the results. The graph below demonstrates how the accuracy of the model increased rapidly as the number of iterations increased.Figure 6displays the accuracy of the model after 100 training and testing epochs.Figure 7shows the ROC curve (AUC = 0.9885) and validates the better classification efficacy of the proposed Bi-LSTM\u2013ACO model, attaining enhanced sensitivity with negligible false positives. Figure 6. Proposed model accuracy of 100 epoch steps. Figure 7. ROC curve of the proposed model. As indicated inTable 2, a variety of assessment measures, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, were used to evaluate the models\u2019 performance. Notably, in terms of accuracy, Bi-LSTM and Bi-LSTM with the ACO optimizer models perform better than the other models. To conduct comparative benchmarking, we have enhanced the evaluation by comparing the proposed Bi-LSTM\u2013ACO model with established state-of-the-art deep learning methodologies, specifically, GRU, LSTM, MLP, CNN-LSTM, and Bi-LSTM. These models are extensively utilized in energy-efficient wireless sensor networks and time-series forecasting. As observed from the results, the proposed Bi-LSTM\u2013ACO achieves significant improvements in all classification metrics. This gain is primarily due to the ACO-based optimization of model weights and hyperparameters, which allows better adaptation to time-dependent sensor data patterns. Table 2. Performance analysis of the proposed model with other models. We assessed the efficacy of different evolutionary optimization strategies by comparing Bi-LSTM models optimized using GWO, PSO, GA, and ACO algorithms, which are presented inTable 3. The ACO-tuned Bi-LSTM attained the maximum performance across all critical metrics, achieving an accuracy of 98.61%, a precision value of 92.16%, a recall value of 98.06%, and an F1 score of 91.41%. PSO and GWO exhibited formidable predictive powers, achieving F1 scores of 89.75% and 89.50%, respectively, underscoring their efficacy in resource-constrained contexts. The GA-based model, albeit exhibiting marginally inferior precision, attained the maximum recall (96.44%), rendering it especially appropriate for irrigation jobs where the omission of positive cases (i.e., instances requiring watering) must be reduced. These findings underscore the significance of ACO in attaining an optimal equilibrium between detection precision and system efficacy in agri-IoT networks. Table 3. Performance analysis of the proposed model with various optimization algorithms. **3.2 Performance evaluation of the model using K-fold validation** Cross-validation is a popular resampling method employed to assess machine learning models with constrained data. It reduces the possibility of overfitting by verifying that the model is evaluated on previously unobserved segments of the data in each iteration. This study employed five-fold cross-validation to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed Bi-LSTM model. The dataset was randomly divided into five equal sections. In each fold, four subsets were utilized for training, while the remaining subset functioned as the validation set. The technique was executed five times, guaranteeing that each subset was utilized once for validation. The model\u2019s performance was assessed using training and validation accuracy and training and validation loss. The Bi-LSTM model attained a mean training accuracy of 98.19% and a mean validation accuracy of 98.20%, demonstrating consistent performance across all folds. The mean training loss and validation loss were 0.0181 and 0.0180, respectively. The results indicate that the model effectively learns underlying patterns during training and generalizes well to novel data, demonstrating excellent stability and reliability of the suggested method. The efficacy of the proposed Bi-LSTM\u2013ACO model was additionally assessed using five-fold cross-validation to guarantee applicability and stability across various subsets of the dataset.Table 4illustrates that the model exhibited consistently elevated training and validation accuracy across all folds, achieving an average training accuracy of 98.19% and a validation accuracy of 98.20%. The associated training and validation loss values remained consistently low and constant, averaging 0.0181 and 0.0180, respectively. The results indicate that the model is appropriately fitted, avoids overfitting, and exhibits strong generalization across various training subsets. The negligible disparity between training and validation accuracy across all folds signifies that the model adeptly identifies the inherent patterns in the data and demonstrates consistent performance on unseen samples. This underscores the effectiveness of the ACO-tuned Bi-LSTM architecture in modeling intricate temporal connections and facilitating precise predictions in smart agriculture IoT applications (Figure 8).

Performance analysis of the model using K-fold validation. **4 Conclusion** This paper presents a Bi-LSTM-based deep learning framework enhanced using the ACO method for effective resource allocation and energy management in agri-IoT settings. The system utilizes real-time sensor data\u2014comprising temperature, humidity, water level, and soil nutrients\u2014gathered using microcontroller-based sensing nodes and saved on the Adafruit IO cloud platform. By integrating time-series learning with Bi-LSTM and optimizing hyperparameters through ACO, the model attains a high level of accuracy in forecasting actuator behavior, such as pump activation, facilitating informed irrigation decisions. Comparative assessments with conventional LSTM, GRU, and Bi-LSTM models reveal that the proposed Bi-LSTM\u2013ACO methodology markedly enhances performance, attaining an accuracy of 98.61%, a precision value of 92.16%, a recall value of 98.06%, and an F1 score of 91.41%. Cross-validation and supplementary measures, including latency and network longevity, further substantiate the system\u2019s resilience and operational efficacy. The suggested strategy boosts prediction reliability and adds to energy-efficient sensor operation, rendering it highly suitable for real-time, large-scale smart agriculture implementations. Future studies will concentrate on optimizing communication characteristics, including path loss and delay, to provide scalable performance in dense IoT networks. **Data availability statement** The raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be made available by the authors, without undue reservation. **Author contributions** MR: writing \u2013 original draft.
