The study deems this to be a safe and cheaper medicine that can be used in aid of conventional treatment.[4] **Astringent Property** Frankincense oil is experiencing growing popularity in the world of clean, alternative beauty. While its antimicrobial properties prove useful on the path to clear skin, frankincense oil also works well as anastringent.
