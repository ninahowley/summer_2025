The suit asks the US District Court for the Northern District of California to halt President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cunlawful militarization\u201d of Los Angeles. Calling Trump\u2019s actions an abuse of power that needs to be ended, Gov. Gavin Newsom further described the administration\u2019s actions as \u201can unmistakable step toward authoritarianism.\u201d The governor stated that the calling up of the California National Guard unit, after the governor expressed hisobjection, only escalated the violence and chaos in Los Angeles. The governor characterized the administration\u2019s \u201cfederalizing the California National Guard\u201d as an illegitimate takeover that had no legal basis. Finally, Newsom warned that thememorandumTrump issued on June 7, entitled \u201cDepartment of Defense Security for the Protection of Department of Homeland Security Functions,\u201d could be used for the president to \u201cassume control of any state militia.\u201d California\u2019s lawsuit comes as the US Northern Command hasannouncedthat it is activating 700 Marines to Los Angeles. The Marines are set to join the California National Guard members who were deployed there over the weekend for the purpose of \u201cprotecting federal personnel and federal property in the greater Los Angeles area.\u201d The Northern Command press release stated that the National Guard members who had already been deployed to Los Angeles and the 700 Marines are both \u201ctrained in de-escalation, crowd control, and standing rules for the use of force.\u201d Together the Guard and Marine personnel are to be designated Task Force 51. The unrest began on Friday June 6, when protesters gathered outside the Federal Building in downtown Los Angeles following reports that Immigration & Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers were conducting raids throughout the city. The Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) was called to the protests, which were later classified as an \u201cunlawful assembly.\u201d On the following night, Trump issued hismemorandumactivating some 2,000 California National Guard troops to be deployed to the protests. This came despite Newsom\u2019s expressed preference for the LAPD to deal with the protesters. On June 8, after the National Guard troops arrived in Los Angeles, the governor demanded that they be withdrawn. Newsom called Trump\u2019s activation of the National Guard illegal, citing10 USC \u00a7 12406(3). FromJURIST, June 10. Used with permission.
