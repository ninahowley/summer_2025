Photo / Herald composite Man about town Ricardo Simich brings youSociety Insider. This week, Al Brown\u2019s new romance revealed; Buyers sought to co-own a slice of $30m Queenstown hotel; meet the former St Kent\u2019s student fulfilling her Ivy League dreams **NZ celebrity chef Al Brown dating a fellowentrepreneur** A new romance is said to have blossomed between beloved Kiwi chef Al Brown and Auckland businesswoman Wendy Francis-Ching. The pair are said to have been dating for more than six months, although they have mixed in some of the same Auckland social circles for several years. Francis-Ching is the former wife of Rich Lister Mark Ching, renowned for his work in the shipping industry. The couple told Society Insider that althoughBrownhad a public profile, they prefer to keep their relationship private. Sources close to the couple say the pair, who both have adult children and have been married previously, complement each other perfectly. \u201cAl\u2019s wit and humour are a perfect match for Wendy; they both match each other with their strong personalities in social situations,\u201d says a source. The pair\u2019s entrepreneurial similarities and get-up-and-go attitude are said to have ignited sparks. After living in and decorating several fabulous homes in the eastern suburbs, Francis-Ching \u2013 formerly a sales executive atTVNZ\u2013 used her love of decor to start the successful upmarket business Consignment Furniture in 2016. The business sold high-end designer brands, includingAntonio Citterio, B&B Italia,Minotti, Philippe Starck, andArmani Casa, and was a huge hit with buyers and well-to-do sellers. Late last year, after a tough few years of trading in Newmarket, Francis-Ching closed Consignment Furniture. There is talk about town that Francis-Ching, a doyenne of the eastern suburbs, may even buy a house with Brown on his side of town, Ponsonby. It is understood that if the pair buy real estate together, they will harness their creative sides on a great design project. Brown has based himself in Ponsonbyand its surrounds since he made the move from Wellington to Auckland 15 years ago, when he took on the city\u2019s hospitality scene by openingDepot Eateryand Oyster Bar as part of SkyCity\u2019s redevelopment of Federal St in 2011. As well as Depot, his businesses now include Federal Delicatessen,Best Ugly Bagels, and a range of products includingcoffee, olive oil, mustards, and ketchups. After becoming a household name with several television shows, Brown joined theMasterChef worldin 2015 in TV3\u2019s version of the hit show, alongsideMichelin star chef Josh Emettand restaurateur Mark Wallbank. Francis-Ching and Wallbank have been friends since Wallbank\u2019s days running Parnell restaurant Cibo in the 1990s. Brown\u2019s down-to-earth approach to cooking, appealing to everyday Kiwis, has seen him write five popular books spanning cooking, fishing and even the Kiwi bach. Last summer, Brown is said to have shown Francis-Ching some of his favourite fishing spots in Northland. Throughout the past five years, Brown has become the unofficial cheerleader of the hospitality scene as it fights for survival. Friends of the pair say they admire each other\u2019s tenacity, and Francis-Ching has been impressed by Brown\u2019s philanthropy. For nearly 10 years, Brown has been an ambassador for Garden to Table, helping schools nationwide teach children about good nutrition. In 2021, Brown launchedTipping Point, a wine range with Constellation Wines, which supports New Zealand charities while celebrating the country\u2019s regions. That journey turned into a six-part video series celebrating regions and entrepreneurs. After the devastation caused by Cyclone Gabrielle in 2023,Brown teamed up with the Restaurant Associationand held New Zealand\u2019s biggest dinner party, with various restaurants joining in to raise money for the mayoral funds. Over the past few years, Brown has become a dab hand with content creation on social media. Hyundai is among the brands Brown works with, and last year he teamed up with his daughter Constance, one of Brown\u2019s two daughters with his former wife, Lizzie Lang. Constance is an influencer and co-hosts the podcast Everyday Solitude. The father and daughter worked together for a campaign with the Australian brand R.M. Williams, wearing the brand\u2019s iconic footwear. Brown seems to have helped Francis-Ching with her content creation. In her one and only Instagram post last November, Francis-Ching posted some gardening gloves from a break in Northland. Brown was quick to copy and post one of her hashtags, #ladygardener, in support. **Award-winning boutique luxury Queenstown hotel to get new life after owner\u2019s death** When it opened, exclusive Queenstown boutique hotelThe Carlinwas described as \u201cbeyond guests\u2019 six-star dreams\u201d. But after its owner, United States property developerKevin Carlin, died suddenly aged 69 of hypertensive heart disease, the hotel was placed into receivership. Now, it is set to be given a new future, relaunched as a private residence collective \u2013 with high-net-worth buyers given the chance to invest in the property in a co-ownership model. The $30 million hotel, with views overLake Wakatipu, was the retirement project of Queenstown-based Carlin. Stays could cost more than $6000 a night, and it was rumoured to be attracting several big-name celebrity guests. As well as having eight suites and an award-winning restaurant, it was Carlin\u2019s private retreat. The Californian native had a singing career and worked as a chef to Hollywood celebrities before patenting mobile kitchens used on movie sets and by the US Army. In the 1990s, he sold his US business and moved to Queenstown, where he made a name for himself as a property developer. Among his projects were New Zealand\u2019s first gated community, the41-section Lakeside Estates, as well as the Waterfront Hotel in Queenstown. But less than a year after opening his dream property, Carlin died. BDO Christchurch, appointed to settle Carlin\u2019s estate, found debt of $45 million and some substantial assets. Stepping in to reinvigorate Carlin\u2019s dream is NZ\u2019s Duchamp Collective, which is partnering with US global co-ownership expert Elite Alliance to relaunch the hotel as The Carlin Residence Club. Elite has created 120 residence club properties in more than 20 countries; its first was in Deer Valley in Utah in 2001. After visiting Elite\u2019s residences atDeer Valley, Duchamp Collective\u2019s veteran South Island developer Richmond Paynter says he saw an opportunity to transform the iconic Queenstown property. Eight private residences are available for co-ownership, which include six two-bedroom suites, a penthouse and a presidential residence. The suites are being sold for between $5.5m and $8.95m, with up to 10 shares available in each, meaning investors can spend between $550k and $895k per co-ownership share. Co-owners will get a certain number of nights to spend in the property per year, with it being available to rent out when not in use. Rental returns are expected to be between $3000 to $9000 per night. Other benefits for co-owners include being able to exchange nights in their Carlin suite for ones in other Elite Alliance properties in destinations including the US, South America, Europe, Asia and Africa. \u201cFor decades, we\u2019ve seen how residence clubs empower travellers to own remarkable holiday homes \u2013 without the burden of full-time management,\u201d says Elite Alliance president Rob Goodyear. \u201cThe Carlin Residences Club is a perfect fit for our network, and we\u2019re thrilled to bring this model to New Zealand for the first time.\u201d Paynter says the Elite model is \u201celegant, sustainable, and responsive to how today\u2019s luxury buyers want to travel: flexibly, globally, and with everything taken care of\u201d. Elite describes its co-owners as high-net-worth individuals, second-home investors, or seasoned global travellers who enjoy luxury hotel facilities, complete with concierge and airport transfers. Duchamp\u2019s interior designers, Susie and Teassa Paynter, are planning refurbishments as part of the transition from a luxury hotel to a private residence club. Included will be enhancements to internal spaces and the addition of new amenities such as a private owners\u2019 lounge and upgraded fitness facilities. After it completes The Carlin Residence Club, Elite says it is considering other opportunities in high-value resort and holiday destinations in New Zealand and Australia. **Kiwi Ivy League student running for NZ** Aucklander Peyton Leigh achieved her dream of attending American Ivy League college Princeton University. But the 21-year-old says she is most proud of her latest achievement, qualifying to compete for New Zealand at next month\u2019s Fisu (International University Sports Federation) World University Games in Germany. The former St Kent\u2019s student is on summer break from her second year of study at Princeton, but isn\u2019t resting on her laurels. Leigh is training hard before she travels to the Rhine-Ruhr region in West Germany in mid-July, where 8500 student athletes from more than 150 countries will compete. \u201cThe games are one of the largest international multi-sport events for student athletes who are currently at university,\u201d Leigh tells Society Insider. \u201cI\u2019m incredibly proud to have qualified for the 5000m and to represent my country on this world stage, it means the world to me.\u201d Leigh\u2019s \u014cr\u0101kei-based parents are Auckland property investors Melanie and Duncan Leigh. Melanie is a former media advertising executive, and Duncan made his mark as an industrial chemist and a director of Chemiplas, one of Australia\u2019s leading suppliers of raw materials. The world\u2019s third-wealthiest man, Jeff Bezos, attended Princeton. His eldest son, Preston, reportedly recently attended too. There are whispers around campus that one of his younger children is now also attending, but such things are kept very private. Athletics New Zealand has a 19-strong World University Games team attending Fisu this year. Also competing in the 5000m is University of Otago student Eva Pringle. The Fisu World University Games will be the first time the Leighs will see their daughter compete for her country. Leigh first competed for New Zealand at the Pacific Games in the Solomon Islands in 2023. She took out silver in the 1500m but unfortunately her parents were unable to be there. \u201cSeeing Peyton compete for her country for the first time will be a proud moment for Duncan and me,\u201d says Melanie. \u201cShe has trained, worked hard and made many sacrifices to be able to compete in Germany.\u201d Leigh is balancing being a student athlete at Princeton while majoring in neuroscience. She had originally planned to study geophysics, as did her father, who got his master\u2019s in geoscience at Waikato University. \u201cAn amazing thing about Princeton is, it takes you out of your comfort zone by requiring you to study a set of liberal arts such as literature, history, languages and sciences,\u201d says Leigh. \u201cIt was studying the sciences that set me on the new path of neuroscience.\u201d Leigh began running competitively at age 14 and quickly fell in love with the sport. She knew she wanted to study in the US, where she could pursue both athletics and academics at a high level. Leigh says her goal shaped many of her decisions during her high school years at St Kentigern College, where she chose to study the International Baccalaureate (IB) curriculum instead of NCEA. \u201cIt was a tough programme, and mixed with training and competing, there were moments I doubted whether I\u2019d made the right choice. \u201cIt challenged me in all the right ways and prepared me well for the academic rigour at Princeton.\u201d For anyone wanting to follow in her footsteps and study in the US, Leigh says her best advice is to \u201cbe persistent\u201d. \u201cThe road isn\u2019t linear, and it definitely takes sacrifice, but the work you put in now will open doors you may not even know exist yet.\u201d Leigh describes the 278-year-old institution in the town of Princeton, New Jersey, as her favourite place on Earth. \u201cThe history, the Gothic-style campus, my friends, teammates, coaches, and professors make the experience so special.\u201d Leigh, who hasADHD, says balancing everything has its challenges. Most days involve one to two training sessions, classes, and hours of studying, which can leave her little time for anything else. \u201cThis year, I\u2019ve been proud of how I\u2019ve managed my time, and it\u2019s allowed me to enjoy a bit of downtime in the evenings and on weekends.\u201d One of her most exciting moments was being part of the team that won the Ivy League Triple Crown, taking home the championship titles in cross country, indoor track, and outdoor track. \u201cIndividually, I contributed points in several events,\u201d Leigh says. With the 5000m discipline now among her achievements, a friend encouraged her to apply for the Fisu games a couple of months ago. \u201cWhen I got the call that I\u2019d made the team, I was shocked and so grateful,\u201d she says. \u201cWearing the national singlet again, especially at such a prestigious global event, is something I\u2019ll never take for granted.\u201d **Party People of the Week** 2025 NZ Radio & Podcast Awards More than 700 guests packed into Auckland\u2019s SkyCity Theatre last Thursday evening for the annual2025 NZ Radio & Podcast Awards, followed by an after-party at Sweat Shop Brewed Kitchen.
