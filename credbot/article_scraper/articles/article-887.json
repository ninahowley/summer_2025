Accordingto San Bernardino County\u2019s April 18, 2025, response to a public records request, 188,001 voter registrations were classified asinactiveafter missing two consecutive federal elections. However, being on the inactive list does not mean those voters are \u201cillegal\u201d or \u201cineligible.\u201d Inactive status is applied when a voter fails to respond to a confirmation notice and does not vote in two general elections, per federal law (NVRA Section 8(d)(2)). These voters can still vote if they verify their eligibility at the polls. Removal from the rolls can only occur after following specific federal and state legal procedures. The document also clarifies that due to a past error, some confirmation notices did not include the required cancellation warning. This oversight delayed lawful removal and led to these records remaining inactive but not purged. This is a compliance issue, not evidence of election fraud or unlawful registrations. Fact or Fiction?Fiction. The 188,001 records are inactive, not illegal or ineligible. The county is following federal law and correcting past administrative oversights, not refusing to clean its rolls. National Voter Registration Act (NVRA) Section 8 OverviewHusted v. A.
