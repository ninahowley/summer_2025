Ranch Fire, San Bernardino, California - June 2025. Credit: CALFIRE BDU The Ranch Fire began at 14:33 LT on June 10, near Bowen Ranch Road and Coxey Truck Trail, approximately 97 km (60 miles) northeast of Los Angeles. As of the latest update, the fire has scorched 1 702 ha (4 205 acres) and remains at 0% containment. Favorable conditions for fire growth, sustained winds up to 30 km/h (19 mph), and low relative humidity have driven the rapid expansion of the fire front. The San Bernardino County Sheriff\u2019s Department issued evacuation orders at 16:30 LT for residents from Milpas Drive to High Road, south of Highway 18. A Reverse 9-1-1 emergency alert was sent to notify residents of the immediate threat. #RanchFirepic.twitter.com/muA0ocDBUz Shelters have been established at Sitting Bull Academy, 19445 Sitting Bull Road, for displaced individuals.
