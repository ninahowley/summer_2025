New York Times bestselling author Marissa Meyer's latest book,We Could Be Magic, is a young adult graphic novel set in a theme park that comes out just in time for summer reading. Meyer is stopping in Arizona on her book tour and spoke with 12News all about her book and what she hopes readers love about this \"sparkly summer romance.\" Tabitha Laurie, the graphic novel's main character, lands her dream job at beloved theme park Sommerland's prestigious summer program. All she wants to do is land a coveted princess role and make magical memories for other kids, just like she has made at Sommerland. But she's got one problem: Tabi doesn't look like the other heroes and heroines at the theme park. What follows is Tabi's quest to find a happily ever after, filled with friends, her not-so-regal position at a nacho stand, and even a new crush. \"The theme for this book is very much don't let anyone tell you what you can and can't be,\" Meyer said. \"That's what I hope really comes across and a message I really think is important.\" Meyer said she wrote the book for curvy girls everywhere\u2014including herself. As a child, she experienced similar challenges to Tabi. She, too, loved drama and auditioned for a role in a production ofLittle Womenas a teenager. Before she could read the part she practiced for\u2014aspiring writer Jo March\u2014the teacher casting the show told her she didn't fit the look for the sisters, and asked her to read for Aunt March instead. \"It crushed me,\" Meyer said. \"I was so upset and disappointed that this teacher looked at me and did not see my talent, did not see how excited I was, she just saw what my body looked like.\" That's why she said it was important to her to write a story featuring a curvy girl: because she was and is the girl you see on the page. \"I wanted to write a story for teen Marissa, and all of the girls out there who are being told because you don't look a certain way, you can't get what you want, or don't deserve love, or happy endings, whatever this thing is that you're dreaming about,\" Meyer said. \"That was the biggest inspiration for this book.\" This isn't Meyers' first graphic novel, but it's the first one she's worked on since 2018. She is an avid reader and grew up loving to read graphic novels, comics, and manga. \"When this story just kind of popped into my head and started to solidify as I was starting to figure out what I really wanted to say, I just saw it, I saw it in illustrated form,\" Meyer said. \"Probably it had something to do with writing a girl who is larger and curvier, and I didn't want there to be any question... I wanted you to see her and I wanted you to know.\" And while much of her process of writing graphic novels is the same as writing prose, Meyer said the work for graphic novels is slower at first, compared to her prose novels. \"I am the writer that likes to get it out as quickly as I can\u2014don't overthink it, don't edit it\u2014just write the story and then worry about revising it and making it better later; that's generally how I work with my prose novels,\" Meyer said. \"With the graphic novel, I find that a lot harder to do, because it's not just getting the story out. You have to pause at every single beat and ask, 'What does this moment look like?'\" Each moment is then described to the illustrator, who works on the panels and blends the author's words and vision with their art. While this makes for a longer first draft process, Meyer says revision is much faster because of it. \"This is the joy of writing graphic novels,\" Meyer said. \"...It is so much fun for me to be able to send a script off to the illustrator, in this case, the fabulously talented Joelle Murray, and then months later I start getting the sketches and the colored illustrations, and it kind of feels like I'm reading something for the first time... I love that part of the process.\" Meyer said she is excited to be on a book tour and is especially looking forward to meeting Murray in person. It's something Meyer said she thinks many readers don't know: that the author and illustrator may not have known one another prior to the project, or even get to meet in person while working together. \"We have spoken to each other once via Zoom, but we've never met in person,\" Meyer explained. \"I can't wait to actually be there to talk with her, because I have questions for her too... I can't wait to talk to her and hear some of her thoughts about behind the scenes and the steps that I wasn't aware of.\" Meyer will be stopping in the Valley as her second stop. She will be at Changing Hands in Phoenix at 6:30 p.m. on June 3.
