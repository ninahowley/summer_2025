The teachers unions\u2014the government\u2019s stormtroopers\u2014have been hard at work running a mass misinformation campaign to convince parents that because this is how it has always been, this is how it has to be. But here\u2019s what you may not realize: the parents are winning, and we have entered the death spiral of the education dictatorship. The school choice revolution is here, and moms and dads are successfully restoring parental rights in education, one state, one school district at a time. InThe Parent Revolution, Dr. Corey A. DeAngelis\u2013public enemy #1 of the teachers\u2019 unions \u2013 takes readers inside this movement like no one else can. As Vox reported in late 2023, DeAngelis has become \u201cthe public face\u201d of the effort, \u201ctraveling from state to state, holding rallies, making media appearances, and tweeting constantly.\u201d Or as another education voice put it, \u201cNo one in education policy, advocacy, or activism has ever lived rent-free in more heads at once than Corey DeAngelis. As America\u2019s most prominent and influential advocate of school choice, DeAngelis unapologetically argues why parents and political leaders must lean into the culture war taking place in schools. He exposes the hypocritical elites who are content to hold other people\u2019s children captive to poorly run government schools while sending their own children to the best private and charter schools out there. And most importantly, he equips readers with the ability to make sure the potent forces of the educational industrial complex don\u2019t regain their footing.
