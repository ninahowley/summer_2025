It was a longer-than-normal session. Lawmakers worked for two weeks without pay, because they couldn't get appropriations and budget bills done before their May 2 deadline for this year. But now with the session done, let's take a look at some of the notable bills the Iowa Legislature passed in 2025. Last month, Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds signed a law to set a statewide policy aimed at curbingcellphone usein the classroom after many school districts showed promise with their own restrictions. School districts will now be able to impose a stricter policy based on the state\u2019s minimum proposal. Phones were a big talker this session. Reynolds also signed a law to prohibit drivers from using their phones while driving, unless it's in a \"hands-free\" mode. Drivers will be limited to a single touch or have to use \u201cverbal commands\u201d to turn your device on or off, or to complete \u201ca function\u201d like calling someone. Iowans will only be able to fully use their phones while at a complete stop \u2014 off the roadway. Here\u2019s how law enforcement said they\u2019dcheck for distracted drivers. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have some common sense with this,\" explained Prairie City Police Chief Kevin Gott. \"There\u2019s going to have to be something that leads up to that. Like the swerving in-and-out, not paying attention, staying a long time at a stop sign. There\u2019s gotta be some reason to think that driver is being distracted.\u201d Lawmakers also passed the governor\u2019s priority to offerpaid parental leavefor state employees. Currently, state employees get no time off for the birth of a child. Now, state workers will receive four weeks of paid maternity leave and one week of paid paternity leave. Four weeks of paid leave will also be given to state employees who adopt a child. Part of the reason the Iowa Legislature went so far into overtime this session was because Senate Republicans disagreed on property owners\u2019 rights. Earlier this month,12 Republican state senatorssurprised many after they signed a letter to oppose any state budget bills until legislation passed to restrict the use of eminent domain for carbon pipeline projects. The legislature passed its bill \u2014 putting theSummit Carbon Solutions' pipeline projectin tough odds. Now, the bill is available for Reynolds to sign, but it's unclear whether she will. **Before You Leave, Check This Out** Jobs Terms of Service Privacy Policy Ad Choices EEO Public File Report FCC Online Public Inspection File Closed Caption Procedures Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information"}
