Here\u2019s what you should know about increasing your chances of being naturalised. **Advertisement** In 2021 some19 percent of applications to become Swisswere rejected whilst another 15 percent were either withdrawn or deferred - a sign that the process is far from straightforward. How quick and easy (or slow and painstaking) the process of obtaining Swiss citizenship is depends on many factors, including whether you are going through a simplified or regular naturalisation. But in either case, the surest way for your application to be rejected is because you are not eligible for citizenship in the first place, or you don\u2019t provide all the required paperwork. For the ordinary naturalisation, the tougher of the two types of procedures, eligibility rules are stricter and you typically need to provide more documentation. These are some grounds for rejecting your application for ordinary naturalisation: **Advertisement** You don\u2019t have a permanent residence C permit and / or have not lived in Switzerland continually for at least 10 years. \u201cThe years you have spent in Switzerland between the ages of 8 and 18 count double, but you must have actually lived in Switzerland for at least six years\u201d,accordingto to the State Secretariat for Migration (SEM). **Advertisement** This includes time spent in the country with a B or Ci permit, as well as a legitimation card issued by the Federal Department of Foreign Affairs.

How being mistaken as a national can put you on the road to citizenship Your application will not be accepted, however, if you have lived in Switzerland only as an asylum seeker (N permit) or on a short stay L permit. Additionally, cantons require a minimum residence period of between two and five years in the commune and in the canton. You are not sufficiently integrated Social integration plays a very important part in the citizenship process. This includes the ability to communicate in the national language of your region, with candidates having to demonstrate an A2 level writing ability and B1 spoken skills under theCommon European Framework of Reference for Languages. Just as essential is acceptance of the Swiss way of life and local customs, as well as good knowledge of your commune and general geographical area where you live. Not paying your taxes on time, being the subject of debt collection proceedings, having unpaid debts and a criminal record are also sure signs that your application will be refused.

Some of these requirements may be difficult to assess until the candidate is invited for a face-to-face meeting, but if it becomes obvious from your application form that you fall short in any of these categories, then your candidacy will be refused. You receive social assistance Depending on public money to support yourself is not well seen in Switzerland if you are a foreigner seeking to be naturalised. In fact, your application for Swiss citizenship will be turned down if you have been on welfare in the three years prior to applying. An exception is made if the benefits are paid back in full before your application is received.

But don\u2019t let the word \u2018simplified\u2019 fool you: your application will be denied if you don\u2019t meet certain criteria. EXPLAINED: Why \u2018simplified\u2019 Swiss naturalisation is actually not that simple Residence requirements If your spouse is Swiss, you must live in Switzerland for at least five years, spend the year prior to submitting the application in Switzerland, be married to and living with the Swiss citizen for at least three years. If you don\u2019t fulfil these requirements, your application will not be accepted.

If you submit the application after your 25th birthday but otherwise meet all the requirements, you can apply for simplified naturalisation until February 55, 2023 provided you will still be under the age of 40 on that date. If any of these criteria is not met, your application will be \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 denied.
