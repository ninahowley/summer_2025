These voices need to be heard before it\u2019s too late.** This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you.Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. Against the odds, some in China are questioning the top-down push to get aboard the artificial intelligence (AI) hype bandwagon. In a tightly controlled media environment where these experts can easily be drowned out, it\u2019s important to listen to them. Across theUSand Europe, loud voices inside and outside the tech industry are urging caution about AI\u2019s rapid acceleration, pointing to labour market threats or more catastrophic risks. But in China, this chorus has been largely muted. Until now. Also Read:Parmy Olson: The DeepSeek AI revolution has a security problem China has the highest global share of people who sayAI toolshave more benefits than drawbacks, and they\u2019ve shown an eagerness to embrace it. It\u2019s hard to overstate the exuberance in the tech sector since the emergence of DeepSeek\u2019s market-moving reasoning model earlier this year. Innovations and updates have been unfurling at breakneck speed and the technology is being widely adopted across the country. But not everyone\u2019s on board. Publicly, state-backed media has lauded the widespread adoption of DeepSeek across hundreds of hospitals in China. But a group of medical researchers tied to Tsinghua University published a paper in the medical journal JAMA in late April gently questioning if this was happening \u201ctoo fast, too soon.\" It argued that healthcare institutions are facing pressure from \u201csocial media discourse\" to implement DeepSeek in order to not appear \u201ctechnologically backward.\" Doctors are increasingly reporting patients who \u201cpresent DeepSeek-generated treatment recommendations and insist on adherence to these AI-formulated care plans.\" The team argued that as much as AI has shown potential to help in the medical field, this rushed rollout carries risks. They are right to be cautious. Also Read:The agentic AI revolution isn\u2019t the future, it\u2019s already here It\u2019s not just the doctors who are raising doubts. A separate paper from AI scientists at the same university found last month that some of the breakthroughs behind reasoning models\u2014including DeepSeek\u2019s R1, as well as similar offerings from Western tech giants\u2014may not be as revolutionary as some have claimed. They found that the novel training method used for this new crop \u201cis not as powerful as previously believed.\" The method used to power them \u201cdoesn\u2019t enable the model to solve problems that the base model can\u2019t solve,\" one of the scientists added. This means the innovations underpinning what has been widely dubbed as the next step\u2014toward achieving so-called Artificial General Intelligence\u2014may not be as much of a leap as some had hoped. This research from Tsinghua holds extra weight: The institution is one of the pillars of the domestic AI scene, long churning out both keystone research and ambitious startup founders. Another easily overlooked word of warning came from a speech by Zhu Songchun, dean of the Beijing Institute for General Artificial Intelligence, linked to Peking University. Zhu said that for the nation to remain competitive, it needs more substantive research and less laudatory headlines, according to an in-depth English-language analysis of his remarks published by the independent China Media Project. These cautious voices are a rare break from the broader narrative. But in a landscape where the deployment of AI has long been government priority, it makes them especially noteworthy. The more President Xi Jinping signals that embracing AI technology is important, the less likely people are to publicly question it. This can lead to less overt forms of backlash, like social media hashtags on Weibo poking fun at chatbots\u2019 errors. Or it can result in data centres quietly sitting unused across the country as local governments race to please Beijing\u2014as well as a mountain of PR stunts. Also Read:AI as infrastructure: India must develop the right tech Perhaps the biggest headwind facing the sector, despite the massive amounts of spending, is that AI still hasn\u2019t altered the earnings outlooks at most of the Chinese tech firms. The money can\u2019t lie. This doesn\u2019t mean that AI in China is just propaganda. The conflict extends far beyond its tech sector\u2014US firms are also guilty of getting carried away promoting the technology. But multiple things can be true at once. It\u2019s undeniable that DeepSeek has fuelled new excitement, research and major developments across the AI ecosystem. But it\u2019s also been used as a distraction from the domestic macro-economic pains that predated the ongoing trade war. Without guard-rails, the risk of rushing out the technology is greater than just investors losing money\u2014people\u2019s health is at stake. From Hangzhou to Silicon Valley, the more we ignore the voices questioning the AI hype bandwagon, the more we blind ourselves to consequences of a potential derailment.\u00a9Bloomberg The author is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering Asia tech. **topics** #artificial intelligence #china #technology Download the Mint app and read premium stories About Us Contact Us Terms Of Use Privacy Policy RSS Log in to our website to save your bookmarks.
