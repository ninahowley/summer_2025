Our \u201cCedar and Sea\u201d exhibit, which highlights contemporary Indigenous artists and their work, opened to the public on Nov. 1, coinciding with the beginning of Native American History Month. Upon entering the exhibit, visitors are greeted by a quote from Iljuwas Bill Reid, an artist who belonged to Raven-Wolf Clan of the Haida Nation: \u201cOh, the cedar tree! If humankind in its infancy has prayed for the perfect substance for all materials and aesthetic needs, an indulgent god could have provided nothing better.\u201d The immersive exhibition illustrates and celebrates the intimate cycle of life between cedar, salmon and sea, as well as the people who\u2019ve made\u2014and continue to make\u2014their living along the Pacific Coast, from Oregon to Alaska. Throughout the exhibit, visitors get to \u201cmeet,\u201d and learn from, six Knowledge Givers in film portraits shot on location in their native homelands. These include present day Washington; Alaska; and Vancouver Island, British Columbia. Indigenous master carvers, a weaver, a gatherer of forest materials, and a fisherman all share their work and speak about their knowledge as a continuum passed from generation to generation over millennia. **Illustrating the Living Traditions of Indigenous Artisans** \u201cCedar and Sea\u201d was inspired, in part by the work of author and illustrator Hilary Stewart, whose book, \u201cCedar: Tree of Life to the Northwest Coast Indians,\u201d provides an understanding of the tree itself, the people of the cedar, and the tools and processes they historically and currently use to support their daily lives. In her book, \u201cThe People of Cascadia: Pacific Northwest Native American History,\u201d researcher and educator Heidi Bohan expanded upon Stewart\u2019s ideas and provided a more expansive overview of the Indigenous people of Cascadia. Storyline Studio, out of Bothell, Washington, who designed the exhibit, wanted to include some process illustrations\u2014or line art drawings\u2014that would help visitors understand how cedar is harvested and used. They selected Seattle-based illustrator Karen Lewis to do the artwork. The resident cartoonist for \u201cCobblestone,\u201d an American history magazine for children, Lewis strives to make her art accessible and accurate. She drew inspiration from Stewart and Bohan but added her own interpretation to create visuals that would add context to the textual content of the exhibit. \u201cHillary Stewart\u2019s illustrations provide prehistoric insight,\u201d museum curator Jeff Smith says. \u201cThe Knowledge Giver videos illuminate contemporary processes, weaving a rich tapestry of understanding across eras.\u201d Additionally, the exhibit includes film of Chief Mungo Martin, a Kwakwaka\u2019wakw Northwest Coast artist whose mastery encompasses painting, carving, singing and songwriting. Contributed by University of California Berkeley, the film \u201creveals an historical narrative,\u201d according to Smith. **From Cedar Forest to Ocean\u2019s Depths** British Columbia-based Three Dimensional Services (3DS) assisted with the installation, while our museum staff collaborated closely with them about the vision, intention, and layout for the \u201cCedar and Sea\u201d exhibit. It organized into four distinct areas. First, there\u2019s The Forest, which features a visual walk through a cathedral forest and an introduction to the cedar, along with a mask created by First Nations artist Karver Everson, who is one of the Knowledge Givers featured in the exhibit. Next, you make your way to the Gathering Basket. In this area, reminiscent of a woven cedar basket, you find a treasure trove of natural materials that people have used and still use to fashion homes, clothing, tools and canoes. From there, visitors can move onto the Traditional Arts section, a huge circular space bounded by cedar forest on one side and glorious ocean shore on the other. Above is a circular ceiling cloud inspired by traditional Salish designs. This space displays an array of beautiful objects\u2014some functional, some decorative\u2014that are mostly fashioned from cedar. In the center sits a canoe crafted by Tutakwisnap\u0161i\u019b Joe Martin, a member of the Tla-o-qui-aht First Nation. Canoe paddles from various tribal nations, which differ size and design from community to community, hang from the walls. The final area, Fishing, takes the visitor \u201cout to sea,\u201d so to speak, where you can learn how people used Ingenious tools and methods to harvest the ocean waters by using their intimate understanding of the natural world. The array of hooks, rakes, floats, harpoons, traps, weirs, and other artifacts that are on display are replicas created by Indigenous artists. They encapsulate incredible craftsmanship, while still being practical and durable for day-to-day use. \u201cCedar and Sea\u201d is a long-term exhibit, with no foreseeable end date, and it is included with museum admission. The Columbia River Maritime Museum is open daily from 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m., except Thanksgiving and Christmas.
