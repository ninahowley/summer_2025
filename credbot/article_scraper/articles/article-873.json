Curtis Means/Pool Photo via AP) By JENNIFER PELTZ and MICHAEL R. SISAK, Associated Press NEW YORK \u2014 Former movie mogul Harvey Weinstein was convicted Wednesday of one of the top charges in his sex crimes retrial but acquitted of another, and jurors were as yet unable to reach a verdict on a third charge. The split verdict meted out a measure of vindication to his accusers and prosecutors \u2014 but also to Weinstein \u2014 after the landmark case was thrown into limbo. **Related Articles** Brian Wilson, Beach Boys visionary leader and summer\u2019s poet laureate, dies at 82 Mary Lou Retton isn\u2019t speaking to family since DUI arrest: report Hugh Jackman\u2019s ex-wife plans memoir on Sutton Foster drama: report Ren\u00e9e Victor, the voice of no-nonsense Abuelita in \u2018Coco,\u2019 dies at her California home Music Review: Miley Cyrus\u2019 \u2018Something Beautiful\u2019 is a return to form. \u2018Hannah Montana\u2019 fans, rejoice The partial verdict came after an extraordinary day in which the jury foreperson expressed dismay to the judge about how deliberations were going and Weinstein himself urged the judge to halt the trial, declaring: \u201cIt\u2019s just not fair.\u201d \u201cMy life is on the line, and you know what? It\u2019s not fair,\u201d the former Hollywood heavy-hitter declared after making an unusual request to address the court. \u201cIt\u2019s time, it\u2019s time, it\u2019s time, it\u2019s time to say this trial is over.\u201d He spoke before learning there was a verdict on any of the charges. Weinstein\u2019s initial conviction five years ago seemed to cement the downfall of one of Hollywood\u2019s most powerful men in a pivotal moment for the #MeToo movement. But that conviction was overturned last year, and the case was sent back for retrial in the same Manhattan courthouse. This time, a majority-female jury convicted the former studio boss of forcibly subjecting one woman, Miriam Haley, to a criminal sex act in 2006. But jurors acquitted Weinstein of another criminal sex act charge. It related to Kaja Sokola, whose allegations of forcible oral sex date to 2006 but were added to the case last year. And jurors were to continue deliberating Thursday on a charge that he raped another woman, Jessica Mann, in 2013. Under New York law, the third-degree rape charge carries a lesser penalty than the first-degree criminal sex act offense. Weinstein, 73, denies sexually assaulting or raping anyone. Jury deliberations had teetered Wednesday. The foreperson \u2014 whocomplained Monday that other jurors were pushing peopleto change their minds and talking about information beyond the charges \u2014 signaled to Judge Curtis Farber that he wanted to talk. \u201cHe said words to the effect of \u2018I can\u2019t go back in there with the other jurors,\u2019\u201d Farber explained later. The discussion was closed to the press and public, but Farber later said the foreperson had expressed that he didn\u2019t want to change his position \u2014 whatever it may be \u2014 and was being bullied. \u201cHe did indicate that at least one other juror made comments to the effect of \u2018I\u2019ll meet you outside one day,\u2019 and there\u2019s yelling and screaming,\u201d the judge said. Weinstein lawyer Arthur Aidala characterized the foreperson\u2019s concerns more severely, saying that the man had said he was concerned for his safety after his fellow panelist talked about meeting him outside and added, \u201cyou don\u2019t know me.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think the court is protecting this juror. Period,\u201d Aidala said, going on to ask for a mistrial. Prosecutor Matthew Colangelo, however, said the foreperson hadn\u2019t seemed afraid or apprehensive, just \u201cstubborn.\u201d \u201cHe said he\u2019d made up his mind, he didn\u2019t want to change it, and people were pressuring him to change it. That\u2019s what jury deliberations involve,\u201d the prosecutor said. The episode was the latest sign of strain among the jurors. On Friday, one of them asked to be excused because he felt another member of the group was being treated unfairly. Weinstein\u2019s lawyers asked unsuccessfully for a mistrial then, and again after the foreperson expressed his concerns Monday. The jury kept deliberating and went through Tuesday without sending any more messages about interpersonal tensions. The seven female and five male jurors started their fifth day of deliberations Wednesday by re-hearing Mann\u2019s testimony that he raped her in a Manhattan hotel room in 2013. The group wrapped up Tuesday\u2019s deliberations by asking to revisit that testimony. Some jurors appeared to take fresh notes Wednesday, while others sat impassively as court stenographers read aloud the requested parts of Mann\u2019s days-long testimony. The jury had already reheard some of the passages last week. Weinstein, 73, an Oscar-winning producer and former Hollywood powerbroker maintains that he never sexually assaulted or raped anyone, and his lawyers portrayed his accusers as opportunists who accepted his advances because they wanted a leg up in the entertainment world. The Associated Press generally does not identify people who say they have been sexually assaulted unless they agree to be named. Haley, Mann and Sokola have done so. **Share this:** Click to share on X (Opens in new window)X Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Facebook Click to print (Opens in new window)Print Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window)Email **RevContent Feed** **Most Popular** San Rafael school trustee arrested for alleged sexual assaultSan Rafael school trustee arrested for alleged sexual assault **San Rafael school trustee arrested for alleged sexual assault** **San Rafael school trustee arrested for alleged sexual assault** Fairfax deems 243-apartment project incompleteFairfax deems 243-apartment project incomplete **Fairfax deems 243-apartment project incomplete** **Fairfax deems 243-apartment project incomplete** San Rafael wildlife nonprofit moves historic buildingSan Rafael wildlife nonprofit moves historic building **San Rafael wildlife nonprofit moves historic building** **San Rafael wildlife nonprofit moves historic building** Larkspur to abandon rental registryLarkspur to abandon rental registry **Larkspur to abandon rental registry** **Larkspur to abandon rental registry** Dipsea: Tiburon\u2019s MacLean makes history with first winDipsea: Tiburon's MacLean makes history with first win **Dipsea: Tiburon\u2019s MacLean makes history with first win** **Dipsea: Tiburon\u2019s MacLean makes history with first win** San Rafael Local Market vendor fair makes debutSan Rafael Local Market vendor fair makes debut **San Rafael Local Market vendor fair makes debut** **San Rafael Local Market vendor fair makes debut** Marin foot juggler takes talent to circusMarin foot juggler takes talent to circus **Marin foot juggler takes talent to circus** **Marin foot juggler takes talent to circus** Marin Transit to test same-day paratransit serviceMarin Transit to test same-day paratransit service **Marin Transit to test same-day paratransit service** **Marin Transit to test same-day paratransit service** Dipsea: Full results for the 114th raceDipsea: Full results for the 114th race **Dipsea: Full results for the 114th race** **Dipsea: Full results for the 114th race** Marin teens chosen as national diabetes advocatesMarin teens chosen as national diabetes advocates **Marin teens chosen as national diabetes advocates** **Marin teens chosen as national diabetes advocates** **More in Crime & Public Safety** Mary Lou Retton apologizes for DUI arrest, enters no contest plea **Mary Lou Retton apologizes for DUI arrest, enters no contest plea** **Mary Lou Retton apologizes for DUI arrest, enters no contest plea** San Rafael school trustee arrested for alleged sexual assault **San Rafael school trustee arrested for alleged sexual assault** **San Rafael school trustee arrested for alleged sexual assault** Ronn Owens seeks donations after daughter\u2019s indictment in \u2018Bachelor\u2019 case **Ronn Owens seeks donations after daughter\u2019s indictment in \u2018Bachelor\u2019 case** **Ronn Owens seeks donations after daughter\u2019s indictment in \u2018Bachelor\u2019 case** Magnitude 3.3 earthquake shakes East Bay **Magnitude 3.3 earthquake shakes East Bay** **Magnitude 3.3 earthquake shakes East Bay** 2025 June 11 Subscriber ServicesSubscribeMarin IJ Storee-EditionSign Up For Newsletters Subscribe Marin IJ Store e-Edition Sign Up For Newsletters Subscribe Marin IJ Store e-Edition Sign Up For Newsletters Contact UsFAQReprintsWork With UsPrivacy PolicyAccessibilitySitemap FAQ Reprints Work With Us Privacy Policy Accessibility Sitemap FAQ Reprints Work With Us Privacy Policy Accessibility Sitemap AdvertiseAdvertising StaffDFM Network Advertising Advertising Staff DFM Network Advertising Advertising Staff DFM Network Advertising MarketplaceDaily AdsJobsReal EstateOpen HousesPlace an ObituaryPlace a Legal Notice Daily Ads Jobs Real Estate Open Houses Place an Obituary Place a Legal Notice Daily Ads Jobs Real Estate Open Houses Place an Obituary Place a Legal Notice Special SectionsNorth Bay WomanPhoto PromotionsGet Sponsored AccessSponsor a Group North Bay Woman Photo Promotions Get Sponsored Access Sponsor a Group North Bay Woman Photo Promotions Get Sponsored Access Sponsor a Group Subscribe Now Terms of Use Cookie Policy Cookie Preferences California Notice at Collection Notice of Financial Incentive Do Not Sell/Share My Personal Information Arbitration Bay Area News Group Copyright \u00a9 2025 MediaNews Group"}
