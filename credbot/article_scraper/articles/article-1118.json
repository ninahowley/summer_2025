If the climate crisis doesn\u2019t get you down, then \u2018drill baby drill\u2019 surely will \u2013 plumbing the depths, as it were, of sheer insanity. Then there\u2019s the wave of extinction threatening wildlife across the globe, from polar bears to honey bees, and Britain, to its shame, languishing in the bottom 10% of countries when it comes to the intactness of its biodiversity. Enough already: where exactly in this little lot, I hear you ask, are the silver linings? One answer \u2013 or rather, dozens of them \u2013 came courtesy of the Rewilding Futures conference in Cambridge earlier this year. Organised by a group of young conservationists calledCitizen Zoo(CZ), it sparkled with success stories in which the tide of destruction has been halted and turned \u2013 and not just among the usual suspects. Take Mozambique. Ravaged by civil war in the 80s, landmines and poaching had taken a devastating toll on its elephants, hippos and zebras. But now a sustained conservation programme, including protected corridors that straddle national borders, has seen wildlife recover to above pre-war numbers. Part of the secret lies in tying the programme to local development schemes such as those for girls\u2019 education, helping bring communities on side. The huge, fat-bodied angel shark \u2013 once seen as severely threatened \u2013 is beginning to bounce back.

Crucially, it allows local people access in order to reap economic benefits \u2013 not least from tourism tied to the revival of the jaguar. This is ecological restoration, as one speaker put it, \u201cwith teeth\u201d. Even beleaguered Britain is doing its bit, said CZ\u2019s director of rewilding, Elliot Newton, pointing out that the UK has more nature reserves than McDonalds restaurants. \u201cIf you think there isn\u2019t enough space, remember that the Scottish Highlands [hardly a haven of productive agriculture, and now home to some of the country\u2019s most ambitious rewilding at scale] has a lower population density than Montana.\u201d That\u2019s just on land: even more remarkable progress is happening in a very different kind of wide open space \u2013 the sea. The transformation here is one of the great unsung stories of conservation, and it was summed up by Charles Clover, veteran environmental journalist and co-founder of the Blue Marine Foundation. The Rewilding Futures conference sparkled with success stories in which the tide of destruction has been halted and turned \u2013 and not just among the usual suspects Twenty years ago, he said, there was only one story here, and it was summed up by the title of his 2005 book, The End of the Line. This charted decades of over-fishing, which had seen stocks plummet to the verge of extinction. It seemed irredeemable. But now a combination of pressure from NGOs, fishers themselves, and that rare thing \u2013 government action \u2013 has rewritten the script, as summed up in the title of his latest book, Rewilding the Sea. Clover points to a rise in marine protected areas (MPAs) under UK control, which is giving stocks a chance to recover. Some of them are close to hand, like the Dogger Bank \u2013 now closed to trawling. Others are far-flung, like the ocean around Ascension Island. International co-operation, with the EU and elsewhere, has reaped rewards too. \u201cTake the Atlantic bluefin tuna \u2013 a fish once thought so valuable that fishing would go on until the last one was caught,\u201d said Clover. Following a sustained campaign, there are now 400% more bluefin, he points out. \u201cWe have bluefin popping up in places where they haven\u2019t been seen for 60 years, all because the right, scientifically based management decisions were finally taken.\u201d Atlantic blue fin tuna numbers have recovered well in recent years. Image: DeepAqua It\u2019s the same story closer to home in Lyme Bay, off the coast of east Devon and west Dorset \u2013 \u201cknown as England\u2019s coral garden\u201d \u2013 where a ban on the trawling practices that had literally scraped the sea bare of almost all life has led to an astonishing recovery. Sixteen years on from the ban, said Clover, there are \u201cfour times the overall number of species, four times the number of commercially valuable fish\u201d. The ban\u2019s since been replicated off the Sussex coast, with similarly promising results, and the idea\u2019s being picked up by fishing communities in the Ionian islands of Greece, too. In all these cases, fish once seen as severely threatened \u2013 from bream to angel shark \u2013 are bouncing back. Clover sums it up. \u201cConservation works: economically as well as ecologically \u2013 if you just let it.\u201d It\u2019s not the end of the story \u2013 industrial fishing still threatens swathes of sea life around the world. But it\u2019s far from the end of the line.
