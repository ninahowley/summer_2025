Despite Promising to Implement Colonna Reforms, UNRWA in Gross Violation of Neutrality Obligations** As documented below, UNRWA is in gross breach of the neutrality commitments that it recently made to donor countries in order for them to reinstate funding, including the agency\u2019s promise to implement all of the findings of the April 2024Colonna Report.Dutch aid minister Liesje Schreinemachertold parliamentin April that the Netherlands would not renew funding to UNRWA unless it implements the Colonna Report\u2019s recommendations. In light of UNRWA\u2019s handling of the al-Sharif case, which is documented below, we urge the Netherlands not to resume funding to UNRWA. Despite UNRWA knowing for more than a decade thatthe head of its teachers union in Lebanon, Fathi al-Sharif (a.k.a. Fateh \u201cAbo Amin\u201d al-Sharif), overseeing 39,000 students in 65 schools, is part of Hamas and an overt promoter of terrorism, the agency is refusing to fire him. UNRWA chief Lazzarini initiated an external review of UNRWA in mid-January 2024 in response to revelations about the agency\u2019s terror ties, including a 3,000-member UNRWA staff Telegram group and the participation of at least 12 UNRWA employees in the October 7 Hamas attack. The mandate of that review, headed by former French Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna, was to \u201cconduct an independent review of mechanisms and procedures to ensure adherence by UNRWA to the humanitarian principle of neutrality.\u201d The Colonna Review Group published its final report, containing 50 separate recommendations, on April 20, 2024. This was immediately followed by acommitmentfrom UNRWA to implement the report, and a cascade of donorsagreeingto renew funding. Separate and apart from UNRWA\u2019s commitments under the Colonna Report, UNRWA is also bound byUN&UNRWAstaff regulations on neutrality (SeeColonna Report p. 18), the UNRWACode of Ethics(newly updated in February 2024), and commitments to other donors. Both UN and UNRWA regulations require staff to \u201cavoid any action and in particular any kind of public pronouncement which may adversely reflect on their status, or on the integrity, independence and impartiality which are required by that status.\u201d The Code of Ethics further explains that UNRWA employees should \u201cnot take sides in situations of armed conflict, public controversies or other political, racial, religious, or ideological disputes.\u201d The Code of Ethics is also clear that \u201cattending demonstrations \u2026 that are political or could become politicized\u201d or \u201cdisplaying controversial flags or symbols, or holding political meetings or religious services in UNRWA installations\u201d all constitute neutrality breaches. Regarding specific donor commitments, we note that when the European Commission announced on March 1 that it would allocate an additional 68 Million Euro to UNRWA, ithighlightedUNRWA\u2019s commitments to (1) review its staff to make sure they did not participate in October 7, (2) launch an audit by EU appointed external experts to review UNRWA controls to prevent involvement of staff in terrorist activities, and (3) strengthen its department of internal investigations. It also welcomed the Colonna review which would \u201cassess whether the Agency is doing everything within its power to ensure neutrality and respond to allegations of serious breaches.\u201d Likewise, even though the U.S. funding freeze has been extended until March 2025, $121 million had already beentransferredto UNRWA by the end of January 2024, and UNRWA is still bound by its commitments in its2023-24 Framework Agreementwith the U.S. These include, (1) addressing neutrality violations in line with UNRWA\u2019s neutrality framework, including prompt and transparent disciplinary proceedings for staff violations, (2) ensuring U.S. assistance is not used to aid a refugee \u201cwho is receiving military training as a member of the so-called Palestinian Liberation Army, or any guerilla-type organization or anyone who has engaged in any act of terrorism,\u201d and (3) to ensure that U.S. funding \u201cdoes not provide assistance to, or otherwise support, terrorists or terrorist organizations.\u201d UNRWA\u2019s handling of the Al-Sharif case breaches all of these obligations and commitments. 1. Staff union politicization & support for Hamas.The Colonna report expressly found that UNRWA staff unions are \u201cpoliticized\u201d and \u201chave sometimes resisted management disciplinary actions, including on neutrality\u201d (p. 32). This is clear from past cases where the staff unions rallied behind teachers who had been suspended for neutrality violations connected to terrorism. In 2011, when UNRWA principal/Hamas member Suhail al-Hindi was suspended for his Hamas activities, the Gaza staff union protested for three months until al-Hindi returned to work. The next year, al-Hindi waselectedhead of that staff union. Indeed, Hamas hascontrolledthe UNRWA Gaza staff union for years. In 2023, when teacher Riad Nimr was suspended for posting support for terrorism on Facebook, the Lebanon staff union orchestrated three weeks of protests until Nimr was returned to work. The same politicization marks the months of protests on behalf of Fateh al-Sharif who heads the UNRWA Lebanon staff union, is a principal in the UNRWA Deir Yassin school, and is also an active member of Hamas. Like with Suhail al-Hindi and Riad Nimr, the UNRWA Lebanon staff union led more than two months of protests, including school strikes across Lebanon, forced UNRWA\u2019s Beirut headquarters to shutdown, and threatened UNRWA\u2019s Lebanon Director Dorothy Klaus, accusing her of blackmailing al-Sharif, until UNRWA Chief Phillipe Lazzarini finally caved to the pressure. Clearly UNRWA has not dealt with the issue of politicization among its staff unions. 2. Hamas-linked unions threaten management.The Colonna report also found that UNRWA\u2019s staff unions have used \u201cintimidation tactics and threats\u201d to force \u201cnumerous UNRWA directors to be transferred to different positions and contexts for their own security\u201d (p. 32). As detailed below, in the context of the Al-Sharif rallies, the Lebanon teachers\u2019 union issued a statement that UNRWA Lebanon Director Dorothy Klaus was \u201cplaying with fire,\u201d accused her of \u201cblackmail,\u201d and created a large banner depicting Klaus with a big red X on her face which was displayed behind al-Sharif when he addressed one of the rallies. The Al-Sharif protests were also backed by a coalition of terrorists which likewise threatened UNRWA, accusing Klaus of doing Israel\u2019s bidding, and saying she had crossed \u201call red lines\u201d and was \u201cignit[ing] fire with [her] own hands to destroy UNRWA.\u201d As in the past, UNRWA allowed itself to be threatened and succumbed to the pressure. Lazzarini even met and negotiated with the terrorists. The Al-Sharif case shows that nothing has changed at UNRWA in this regard. 3. Gross violation of neutrality obligations under UN & UNRWA Regulations and ethics code.While UNRWA did suspend al-Sharif in February 2024, al-Sharif\u2019s current status is unclear. The reports discussed below indicate that UNRWA suspended al-Sharif and asked for his resignation, but that he refused. According to the Palestinian Refugees Portal website, Lazzariniagreedto cancel the suspension in exchange for ending the UNRWA strike that was paralyzing UNRWA\u2019s operations in Lebanon. The Colonna Report recommended UNRWA to \u201cstrengthen disciplinary processes across the agency\u201d (p. 24). UNRWA\u2019s handling of the al-Sharif case reflects the opposite. As detailed below, the evidence is overwhelming that al-Sharif and his UNRWA colleagues in Lebanon grossly breached their neutrality obligations and that al-Sharif should have been fired long ago. Al-Sharif is a member of Hamas.As shown below, Al-Sharif has attended Hamas events, rallies, and funerals, always appearing near the Hamas leadership. Key Hamas leaders attended his son\u2019s wedding, including Ahmad Abd Al-Hadi who justtolda Lebanese newspaper that if Hamas could go back in time, it would still commit the October 7 attack. It is not accidental that a person like al-Sharif who is closely associated with Hamas heads the UNRWA Lebanon teachers\u2019 union. This is exactly the same modus operandi seen with Suhail al-Hindi in Gaza in 2011-12. This alone constitutes a breach of neutrality.

Al-Sharif openly supports terrorism on Facebook.A quick glance at Al-Sharif\u2019sFacebook page, which has4,000 friends, shows that he openly supports Hamas and other terrorist groups in breach of UN & UNRWA regulations and the UNRWA Code of Ethics. For example, on October 7, al-Sharif praised the Hamas attacks, proclaiming \u201cGod is the greatest, God is the greatest\u2026\u201d On July 2, 2019, he praised Hamas leader Hassan Youssef as a \u201cfirm leader,\u201d adding \u201cwe are all proud of you.\u201d On November 21, 2021, he celebrated Hamas terrorist Fadi Abu Shkhidem with the words \u201cour blood creates victory\u201d after Abu Shkhidem was killed carrying out a terrorist attack that killed one and injured four. On November 23, 2023, Al-Sharif also endorsed Hamas\u2019s hostage-taking as a strategy to get convicted Palestinian terrorists released from Israeli jails. These are just some examples of many.

Organizes politicized student protests on UNRWA premises.As detailed below, Al-Sharif proudly boasts on Facebook about the many political rallies he organized for his students in UNRWA camps and facilities, including within school grounds, clearly violating UNRWA\u2019s Code of Ethics. At one of these rallies, a student is seen holding a Hamas flag.

Other UNRWA Lebanon employees are in gross breach of neutrality.Aside from al-Sharif, many other UNRWA Lebanon employees have been implicated in neutrality violations and should be investigated and disciplined. At a minimum, these include all of the UNRWA employees that clicked like on al-Sharif\u2019s hateful Facebook posts and all of the UNRWA Lebanon employees \u2013 some 2,000 \u2013 that have been participating in the strikes in support of al-Sharif, shutting down UNRWA services, and demanding that al-Sharif be reinstated.

Pursuant to UNRWA\u2019s framework for cooperation agreement with the U.S., UNRWA must conduct prompt and transparent disciplinary proceedings for staff violations. The proceedings against al-Sharif have been neither prompt nor transparent, as UNRWA has refused to publicly clarify al-Sharif\u2019s current employment status. Moreover, UNRWA is to ensure that funding does not go to support any refugee who has received military training from a terrorist organization, or to support terrorism. Not enough is known about al-Sharif\u2019s Hamas activities to ascertain whether these provisions have been breached, but UNRWA should be conducting a full investigation about al-Sharif\u2019s Hamas ties and activities and publicize its findings. **** **II.Dorothy Klaus Suspends Al-Sharif For Colonna Review, But Refuses to Fire Him** In the wake of October 7th, UNRWA premises in Lebanon experienced months of political protests and fundraising campaigns related to the war in Gaza at thebehestof the UNRWA Teachers Staff Union. This includedorganizinga \u201cnational open day\u201d at all UNRWA schools where students and teachers were required to \u201cwear the Palestinian Kofiya, wear black clothes and raise the Palestinian flag,\u201d and shed \u201clight on the right of our people to resist the occupier according to a planned program, calling on the student forces and parents of students to organize angry demonstrations that go round the streets of camps and cheer for Palestine, Aqsa, prisoners and martyrs.\u201d Protests like these continued unchecked for months, in clear violation of UNRWA neutrality rules, and paralyzed the UNRWA school system in Lebanon. UNRWA took action only in February 2024 because of the public scrutiny it was facing after its largest donors had suspended funding over severe neutrality breaches by UNRWA staff and the Lazzarini appointed the external review led by Catherine Colonna to assess UNRWA\u2019s compliance with neutrality. These developments prompted UNRWA Lebanon Director Dorothy Klaus tosummonseveral UNRWA school principals who had been leading the disruptive political activities, warning them that they were in violation of UNRWA neutrality and that they would have to resign if they refused to comply. Despite the warnings from Klaus, the disruptive political activities on UNRWA premises in Lebanon continued. Therefore, on February 26, KlaussummonedFateh al-Sharif, one of the protest leaders who is also the principal of UNRWA\u2019s Deir Yassin High School and head of the UNRWA Lebanon teachers\u2019 union, and informed him that he had until March 2 to resign or face an investigation for his political activities on UNRWA premises. When al-Sharif declined to resign, Commissioner General Philippe Lazzarini sent him anemailconfirming his suspension for three months for \u201cpolitical activities violating neutrality.\u201d In addition to being a leader of the post-October 7th protests in UNRWA facilities, Al-Sharif is also a Hamas member. He has attended Hamas events, rallies, and funerals, always appearing near the Hamas leadership. For example, in December 2021, Al-Sharifparticipatedin the funeral of three Hamas members who had been killed by the Palestinian Authority. Heeulogizedthe Hamas members as \u201cour martyrs\u201d and \u201cmen of high importance\u201d and wished \u201ccurses upon those who killed them,\u201d referring to the PA forces.As noted above, key Hamas leaders attended al-Sharif\u2019s son\u2019s wedding. Al-Sharif also has close personal ties with other terrorists. In June 2023, al-Sharifmournedthe death of his friendSheikh Haitham Abdul Karim Al-Saadi(\u201cAbu Tariq\u201d), deputy emir of theAsbat al-Ansar\u2014 designated as a terrorist organization by the U.S., UK, Canada, the UN, and others \u2014 whom he referred to as his \u201chonorable brothers.\u201d **** **III.UNRWA Union and Terrorist Groups Unite to Threaten UNRWA Officials** Al-Sharif\u2019s suspension provoked significant backlash. The UNRWA Lebanon teachers\u2019 union quicklyissued\u201cStatement No. 1,\u201d characterizing the suspension as an \u201cexistential threat,\u201d \u201cblackmail,\u201d and a \u201cdeclaration of war,\u201d while praising al-Sharif\u2019s reputation as a union leader, as well as al-Sharif\u2019s leadership in hiring hundreds of UNRWA teachers. \u201cWhoever does not know who \u201cFateh Amin Sharif\u201d is among his people, let him know that he is a man the size of a nation, and whoever dares to blackmail this important person is blackmailing our Palestinian people in Lebanon from the far north to the far south. Neither UNRWA nor any framework in this world, no matter how high its status, can blackmail us with our patriotism, thought, and belonging to our beloved land\u201d \u201c[Klaus] is playing with fire and an existential war in which only the owners of the land and the cause will remain,\u201d indicating that \u201cneither the UNRWA agency nor any framework in this world, no matter how high its status, can blackmail us.\u201d Palestinian terrorist groups such asHamas, through its Office of Refugee Affairs, and the PFLP defended al-Sharif, framing UNRWA\u2019s actions as an attack on Palestinian national identity \u2014 \u201cthe national affiliation of our people\u2019s employees is a red line that we do not allow to be crossed.\u201d Subsequently, a coalition of Palestinian terrorist groups, including the Palestinian Forces Alliance, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), the Democratic Front (DFLP), the Islamic Forces, civil committees, representatives of the Palestine Scholars Council and Association, the Houthis, and the Popular Committees made a \u201cdeclaration of conflict and administrative disobedience\u201d with UNRWA. These groups made it clear that the PLO and PA were not welcomed as part of the coalition. They imposed a nationwide strike in 62 UNRWA schools affecting 36,000 children, proclaiming this as a warning that would escalate if the decision was not reversed. The protests also forced the shutdown of UNRWA\u2019s Beirut headquarters. This terrorist coalition also made direct threats to UNRWA Lebanon Director Dorothy Klaus insinuating that she was working with Zionist forces despite Klaus\u2019s adamant stance that she was only trying to reassure donor states. In onestatementthe coalition asked: \u201cIn whose interest will the file of accountability for intellectual and political affiliation be activated at this time? Who is the instigator of this? For whose benefit does this new terrorism practice against specific intellectual and political trends under the pretext of supporting donor countries? Are the Director General, her team, and those who incited her able to bear the consequences of this new and dangerous trend.\u201d In a joint letter, the coalitionwrote: \u201cThe UNRWA administration in Lebanon, represented by its Director General, Mrs. Dorothy Klaus, crosses all red lines and ignites fire with its own hands to destroy UNRWA, in complement and harmony with the malicious projects that aim to liquidate the issue.\u201d \u201cThe Palestinian political forces are determined to wage the confrontation until the end so as not to repeat the rosary and threaten employees with dismissal as a sword drawn over their necks under the pretext of violating \u201cneutrality,\u201d which means stripping national affiliation in favor of the job or stopping financial funding for \u201cUNRWA,\u201d considering that the political forces refuse. UNRWA\u2019s attempts to classify employees, distinguish between them, and threaten them, stressing that the threat of employees by the agency\u2019s director in Lebanon, Dorothy Klaus, is a tampering with the social security and civil stability of the Palestinian community in Lebanon\u2026\u201d In thepicturebelow, Fateh al-Sharif is seen delivering a speech in front of the UNRWA HQ in Beirut with a banner featuring Dorothy Klaus with a red X over her face.The secondpictureis the posters put up by the student forces of Klaus. In anotherstatement, the coalition threatened to equate the UNRWA administration with enemies of the \u201cresistance\u201d unless UNRWA reverses its decision: The UNRWA administration warned against targeting any of our people\u2019s employees, and we will place them in line with the malicious projects that target our people and their resistance\u2026\u201d Philippe Lazzarini\u2019s deputy, Antonia De Meo, further fueled the tension bysuggestingthat the agency could transfer its services to a Palestinian administration, causing an uproar among Palestinians who insist UNRWA must continue to exist until their right of return is realized. The DFLP\u2019s Relief Agency Department expressed its rejection of De Meo\u2019s proposal,statingthat it \u201ccontradicts the decision to establish UNRWA which links its existence to the end of the reason for which it was established\u201d \u2014 the \u201creason\u201d being the creation of the State of Israel \u2014 and that the Palestinian Authority is not a substitute for UNRWA. For more than two months, al-Sharif, student leaders, and leaders of this terrorist coalition coordinated protests across UNRWA premises. A student associationvowedto escalate its measures if the administration did not meet their demands: \u201cWe denounce this unjust decision and demand that the UNRWA administration reverse it. Otherwise, we in the student forces and Palestinian youth organizations in Lebanon will proceed to take escalatory measures in all regions and gradually if the administration does not respond to our legitimate demand\u2026\u201d In early March, Al-Sharifspokein front of a student march in the Al-Bass camp, where Deir Yassin High School is located, asserting that he has not resigned and will not change his position or stop his activities. Al-Sharif said: \u201cThe job was never a goal, and it will never humiliate us, nor will it make us give up our rights, our dignity, and our pride. I said it, and I say it, and I repeat it, that our affiliation to Palestine, to our people, to Gaza, to the West Bank, and to all of Palestine, is a religious affiliation, and there is no going back from it.\u201d Member of the Popular Committee of Ain al-Hilweh Camp, Adnan al-Rifai, told onenews sourcethat it is impossible to expect UNRWA employees to be neutral: \u201cThis neutrality, as UNRWA wants, means attacking the Palestinian national situation. How is it possible for the employee to remain a spectator to the slaughter of his people?\u201d How can he remain neutral? It\u2019s dangerous. The Palestinian employee is a local employee, not an international employee. How can they want him to be neutral, when he is at the mercy of the Palestinian people and lives with their suffering, poverty, misery, and deprivation?\u201d He went on to add that if the situation is not reversed they would escalate and forcibly prevent Klaus from entering the camp. **** **IV.UNRWA Caves to Terrorists Demands** UNRWA caved in to the terrorists\u2019 demands. First, itblamed donorsfor the actions it had taken against al-Sharif, stating \u201cdonor countries will not support UNRWA if the administration does not take such measures against him [Al-Sharif] and other employees.\u201d UNRWA explained that it is not enforcing its own neutrality policies because it wants to abide by these rules, but rather that it is being forced to do so in order for states to have cover to appease their own constituencies so that they can continue funding the agency. Next, Lazzarini attempted to further distance UNRWA from the actions against al-Sharif byexplainingthat \u201cthe decision is carried out by the Department of Internal Oversight Services, based on reports about alleged activities carried out by the employee that violate the agency\u2019s regulatory framework.\u201d These explanations did not dissuade the terrorist coalition from continuing the protests. Strike leadersarguedthat similar measures had been imposed on other teachers in the past, including Professors Ahmed Meyari, Ziad Abdel Ghani, and Ahmed Nimr Mustafa in 2023, and Muhammad Khalil Abu Arab in 2022, but these teachers were all ultimately reinstated after widespread protests pressuring UNRWA management. Therefore, they insisted on continuing the pressure campaign with regard to al-Sharif. Once again the terrorist coalition was able to successfully apply this strategy in the Al-Sharif case. OnMay 27th, Lazzarini traveled to Beruit where he met with the terrorist leaders in a meeting mediated by Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati. One of the terrorist leaders who spoke at this meeting was none other than Hamas Lebanon representative Ahmad Abd Al-Hadi who justendorsedHamas\u2019s October 7 attack.At the meeting, Lazzarini conceded to the terrorist coalition\u2019s demands andreportedlyagreed to reinstate al-Sharif in exchange for getting the UNRWA Beirut headquarters reopened. In doing so, Lazzarini contravened his commitment to donors to implement the Colonna Report\u2019s findings and recommendations from just one month earlier. Will UNRWA\u2019s top officials finally acknowledge that they are not in control of their staff and therefore are unable to implement the Colonna Report as promised? No, instead it appears that the administration is attempting to cover up this story while it continues business as usual. Also importantly, who really is Fateh al-Sharif and how did he manage to gain the support of terrorist groups and even the Lebanese prime minister? What prompted UNRWA to suspend him in the first place? **** **V. Examples of Al-Sharif\u2019s connections and support for Hamas and other terrorists** Following are only a few of al-Sharif\u2019s countless publicFacebookposts, and pictures of him from Hamas accounts, making it clear why an entire coalition of terrorist groups rallied behind him these past few months, shutting down UNRWA operations in Lebanon.In his posts, al-Sharif celebrates the October 7th massacre, shares pictures of himself organizing political rallies for his UNRWA students, celebrates the killing of Israelis, states that resistance \u201cby all means\u201d is a \u201cright,\u201d glorifies various terrorists, and encourages teachers to disseminate maps that erase Israel.In turn, these posts promoting terrorism and the elimination of Israel were liked and shared by numerous other UNRWA employees. However, UNRWA has failed to fire any of these employees who violate the agency\u2019s rules on \u201cneutrality.\u201d BELOW: October 19, 2023pictureof al-Sharif sitting in front row at a Hamas event among its leadership in Lebanon.In the first picture below, al-Sharif is seen sitting with his arms crossed, as the Hamas chief political officer in Lebanon, Ahmed Abdul-Hadi,addressed the crowd one week after October 7th, to celebrate the \u201cmartyrdom\u201d ofthree Hamas terrorists\u2014 Ahmed Osama Othman and Yahya Nayef Abdel Razek from Ain al-Hilweh camp, and Suhaib Omar Kayed from Wadi al-Zeina \u2014 who were killed while attempting toinfiltrate from Lebanoninto the northern Israeli community of Moshav Margaliot. \u201cWe have very strong relations with Hezbollah. We were cooperating with Hezbollah before the attack on Israel and after and now we are in full cooperation,\u201d Abdul-Haditold Politicothe day before. \u201cThey are saying they are geared for a major war.\u201dAsked about the October 7th massacre, Abdul-Hadi recentlydeclared: \u201cIf we could go back in time, we would do it again.\u201d This event was publicized by a Hamas-affiliatednewschannel that publishes pictures of other Hamas events in the same location featuring children training to be terrorists: On the same day that this Hamas-linked account showed UNRWA official al-Sharif attending the Hamas event eulogizing the terrorists, it alsoshowed related photosof \u201cDistributing sweets in Wadi Al-Zeina in the joy of our martyr,Saheb Omar Kaid, may Allah have mercy on him.\u201d Hamas was celebratinga local \u201cmartyr\u201dfrom the town, one ofthree Al Qassam terroristskilled on October 13, 2023 while attempting toinfiltrateinto Israel from Lebanon near the northern town of Margaliot. The account continued to announce events celebrating the Hamas terrorist, \u201cOur hero martyr, Saheb Omar Kaid,\u201d including a \u201cvictory seminar\u201d in honor of the terrorist, the video of which was postedhere. The terrorist was also honored at anApril 1, 2024 eventby the Islamic Association of Palestine Students, a pro-Hamas youth group that was one of many associations mobilized to pressure UNRWA into backing down from requesting al-Sharif\u2019s resignation.

OnJune 24, 2020,top officials from Hamas and other terrorist organizations attended the engagement party of Fateh al-Sharif\u2019s son, Ibrahim Fateh Sharif. This is al-Sharif and his two sons embracing Sheikh Haitham Abdul Karim Al-Saadi \u201cAbu Tariq\u201d, deputy emir of the terrorist group Islamic Ansar League. Here is al-Sharif and his son Ibrahim with Hamas Spokesman, Jihad Taha between them. Here is al-Sharif with the Public Relations Officer for Hamas in Lebanon Dr. Ayman Shana and Hamas\u2019 UNRWA lobbyist Hajj Abu Hussam Zuaiter. Here is al-Sharif with Hamas representatives Ahmad Abd Al-Hadi and Ali Baraka. Ali Baraka is a senior Hamas official who oversees the group\u2019s foreign relations. He was one of 8 Hamas officialssanctionedby the US and UK after October 7th for perpetuating the massacre. Baraka hasclaimedthat Hamas has been planning October 7th for two years and has beenvocalin his support for the taking of hostages. OnFebruary 1, 2019, top Hamas officials also attended the engagement of Fateh al-Sharif\u2019s other son, Amin Fateh Sharif. The Hamas trio of Ahmad Abd Al-Hadi, Jihad Taha, and Abdul Majeed Al-Awad who appear multiple times with al-Sharif have been hosted as the official representatives of Hamas in Lebanon at a series of meetings, including with the Ambassadors ofIran,Russia,Qatar,Turkey,Algeria,Indonesia,CubaandVenezuela. They have also been hosted by Lebanese officials including the Minister of LaborMustafa Bayram, and the former prime minister of Lebanon,Hassan Diab. They have also represented Hamas in meetings with the officials ofHezbollah,Islamic Jihad, andal-Jamaa al-Islamiya. Finally, they have also been interviewed as Hamas representatives byal-JazeeraandNewsweekwhere Al-Hadi once stated, \u201cWe coordinated with Hezbollah and with Iran before, during, and after this battle at the highest levels\u201d concerning the October 7th attacks. In at leastone meetingwith the Russian Ambassador,onewith the Venezuelan Ambassador, andanotherwith the terrorist group al-Jamaa al-Islamiya the topic of discussion was how to pressure UNRWA. Inonemeeting with the Vice-President of the Supreme Islamic Shiite Council, Sheikh Ali al-Khatib, the trio conveyed greetings from Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, and inanothermeeting, Al-Hadi relayed a message from Haniyeh to Nasrallah through Hezbollah\u2019s liaison. Jihad Taha andAhmad Abd Al-Hadi have also been involved in UNWRA demonstrations before. OnJanuary 23, 2016,both can be seen holding a banner in front of UNRWA headquarters in Beirut protesting changes to UNRWA\u2019s health policies. OnMarch 29, 2018al-Sharif organized an event with Hamas to honor the teachers in the Al-Bass Camp and oppose the Deal of the Century. Hamas\u2019 political and media relations officer Abdul Majeed Al-Awad told teachers \u201cthat this day is the day of insistence on liberating every speck of dirt from Palestine, and our Palestinian people have proven with their blood that we are the legitimate owners of the land, and the occupiers are the alien strangers.\u201d He went on to add that, \u201cwe must all stand in one row to confront the deal of the century, stressing that the greatest response to the deal is the return marches, working to unify and strengthen the Palestinian ranks, and agreeing on a unified strategy based on the option of confrontation and resistance.\u201d In effect, al-Sharif is collaborating with Hamas to ensure teachers are implementing the Hamas philosophy of violent resistance in their classrooms.
