Download your copy today. **Report | Strategic Priorities for the Future of Volunteeringfrom Points of Light** Nonprofits face increasingly challenging times, being asked to do more than ever. The demand for services delivered by volunteers is soaring. However, the systems that make volunteering possible are under-resourced and overstrained. Volunteers don\u2019t just lend a hand; they build stronger communities. Individuals who volunteer are also more likely to vote, join civic organizations, donate and stay engaged. AtPoints of Light, we believe volunteering is one of the most powerful tools we have to strengthen communities. That\u2019s why we commissioned this report \u2014From Nice to Necessary: Unleashing the Impact of Volunteering Through Transformative Investment, informed with research conducted by The Bridgespan Group, a global nonprofit advisory firm. It sheds new light on the essential role volunteers play in nonprofit and social sector success, as well as the urgent need for greater investment in volunteer engagement and infrastructure. **Key Findings** **The impact of volunteers is enormous but hasn\u2019t been sufficiently quantified** While nonprofits often have data on volunteer outputs (e.g., volunteer hours), data showing the true impact of volunteers on social outcomes is very scant. This is particularly true as it relates to broader community and societal impacts. **The full cost of volunteer engagement hasn\u2019t been sufficiently quantified** Effective volunteer engagement is a complex process. Nonprofits rarely have the tools, time and resources to quantify the true costs of recruiting, training, retaining and recognizing volunteers. **Limited impact and cost data fuels a lack of alignment between nonprofits and funders** Limited data makes it harder to articulate costs and benefits of volunteers and for funders to understand how investments in volunteer infrastructure might help achieve the measurable outcomes they are seeking. Many funders see volunteering as a byproduct of nonprofit work rather than a strategic input requiring investment. **This lack of alignment limits funding that flows to volunteer engagement and infrastructure from institutional funders** The top 10 U.S. foundations allocate just 0.07% of their portfolios to volunteer development \u2014 severely limiting impact. As a result, critical volunteer infrastructure is undeveloped. **Corporate funders support volunteer efforts at higher levels than foundations, though direct support for volunteer engagement is still limited** Corporations fund volunteer engagement more than foundations, but it remains a small part of their overall giving. Lack of impact data is less of a barrier, as many also see volunteerism as a tool for employee engagement, skill building and community investment. **What We\u2019re Doing Next** In response to the findings, Points of Light is taking action to address the gaps identified in the report and drive a national volunteer movement to increase engagement. We are committed to using the insights gained to drive large-scale change with a multitude of positive ripple effects. With volunteer participation rates stagnating between 20 and 30 percent for decades and only 28 percent of the U.S. population currently engaged in formal volunteering, the report highlights both the challenges of sustaining volunteering as well as the benefits. Bring together a research advisory council on impact to create a comprehensive research agenda, focusing on filling the gaps identified in the report and further understanding the true impact of volunteering. Prioritize investments in nonprofit capacity building to help organizations gather better data and insights, enhancing their ability to measure and demonstrate the value of volunteers. Points of Light will also leverage the deep experience and on-the-ground knowledge of its Global Affiliate Network \u2014 comprised of 120 leading nonprofit organizations \u2014 to champion, inform, and accelerate volunteer engagement efforts. Build a coalition of partners to develop and implement a national plan for increasing volunteering in the U.S., with the goal of doubling national volunteer rates by 2035.
