Final turnout for the citizenship vote stood at 30.59 percent (just over 14 million voters),according toItaly\u2019s interior ministry. This means that the referendum won\u2019t count, whatever its result may be. Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna were the regions with the highest voter turnout, with 39.09 and 38.10 percent respectively. The lowest regional turnout figures were recorded in Trentino Alto Adige (22.70 percent), Sicily (23.10) and Calabria (23.82). The other four referendums, which concerned labour law provisions on unlawful dismissals, severance compensation in small businesses, employment contract conditions and contractors\u2019 liability over workplace injuries, also failed to reach the quorum as turnout stood below 31 percent. Final turnout figures across all five referendums were even lower than projections made in the lead-up to the vote, whichforecastthat around 33 percent of Italians would head to the polls on June 8th-9th. Maurizio Landini, the leader of Italian trade union CGIL, slammed the low turnout as a sign of a \"clear democratic crisis\" in Italy. Riccardo Magi, leader of the centrist +Europa party, which had campaigned for the citizenship reform,saidthat \"organised abstentionism\" had won. He added, however, that his party did not feel defeated. \u201cWe have put back at the centre of public discussion a topic that no longer existed: that of a reform of the laws on citizenship,\" he said. **Advertisement** Voter participation in national referendums has historically been low in Italy. Of 77 referendums held over the past 50 years, only 39 met the voter threshold. And only four of those were held in the past 30 years. Political analysts had expressed concerns that the abstention rate may be particularly high in the June referendums after the ruling hard-right coalition, which strongly opposes the proposed labour and citizenship reforms, publiclycalled on its supportersto boycott the vote. READ ALSO: 'Stay home': Italy\u2019s government boycotts 'dangerous' citizenship vote Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said on Tuesday that she would go to her polling station but not vote in any of the referendums, including the citizenship vote,sparking cries of outrageamong opposition members. Meloni laterdefended her decisionto abstain from voting, saying that abstention was \u201ca right for everyone\u201d. \"I don\u2019t agree with the subjects of the referendums and, as has always been the case in the nation\u2019s history, when you don't agree, abstention is also an option,\" she said. **Advertisement** After all five referendums saw poor voter turnout on Sunday, several politicians and political experts in Italy called for a sweeping reform of the country\u2019s referendum laws. \u201cWe\u2019ll need to adopt a different approach\" given that \u201cno referendum has reached the quorum in recent years,\u201d Benevento Mayor Clemente Mastellasaid. The reform should include the \u201clowering of the quorum, which now seems almost impossible to reach,\u201d he added. In the run-up to the June 8th-9th vote, some suggested lowering the quorum from 50 to 40 percent, while others proposed eliminating it altogether. **More** **Comments (1)** Join the conversation in our comments section below.Share your own views and experience and if you have a question or suggestion for our journalists then email us atnews@thelocal.it.Please keep comments civil, constructive and on topic \u2013 and make sure to read ourterms of usebefore getting involved.
