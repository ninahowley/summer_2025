Over 800 attacks left teachers and other staff with injuries so severe, they had to be reported to the safety regulator. They include fractures, open wounds and even sight loss. **How many teachers are injured because of violence in schools?** Workplace injuries above a certain threshold of seriousness must be reported to the Health and Safety Executive (HSE). Earlier this year, FactCheck revealed thatthe number of violent injuries to staff reported by schools had doubled in the ten years to March 2023. Now new figures, obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, show the number of reported incidents has risen further. The HSE recorded 834 injuries to school staff caused by violence across England, Scotland and Wales in the year to March 2024 \u2013 18% higher than the previous year. They included 187 fractures, 39 cuts and open wounds, 23 reports of a staff member losing consciousness and four incidents of lost or reduced sight. In each of these categories, the number of reports was higher than the previous year. The HSE figures do not cover Northern Ireland, which has a different system. The injuries were not necessarily inflicted by pupils \u2013 they could include any caused by parents or other adults. They could also include injuries sustained as a result of challenging behaviour from children with special educational needs. More than half of the reports came from primary schools. **What are governments doing about violence in schools?** Matt Wrack, acting general secretary of the NASUWT teaching union, urged ministers to establish a national forum on school safety. He said: \u201cThese figures represent the tip of the iceberg as we know that in too many cases schools fail to report serious assaults and attacks on teachers.\u201d He called on schools to ensure they had effective behaviour management policies in place to deal with and deter violence and abuse. For England, a spokesperson for the Department for Education said they \u201cknow there is more to do to turn the tide of poor behaviour\u201d in schools. They pointed to new \u201cAttendance and Behaviour Hubs\u201d to \u201cdirectly support\u201d hundreds of schools, and plans to expand \u201caccess to mental health support to every school\u201d. A spokesperson for the Scottish Government said: \u201cThese figures show that violent behaviour in schools is an issue across the UK, and in Scotland we are providing support and direction at a national level through our Relationships and Behaviour in Schools Action Plan.\u201d A spokesperson for the Welsh Government said: \u201cAny form of violence or abuse against staff in our schools is completely unacceptable.\u201d The spokesperson pointed to a recent government \u201cbehaviour summit\u201d to help schools.
