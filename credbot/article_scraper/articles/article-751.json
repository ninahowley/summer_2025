The suggested change may not align with the boroughcode. At the last Haines Borough Assembly meeting on May 27, Assembly members Richard Clement and Mark Smith expressed frustration with Mayor Tom Morphet. Here\u2019s a snippet of the conversation, which starts off with the mayor talking about accessory dwelling units. Morphet: \u201cYou know, if we want to get into building standards\u2026 Clement: Point of order. Morphet: What\u2019s your point? Clement: Chair is engaging in debate. Morphet: That\u2019s right, that\u2019s allowed, that\u2019s allowed. If we want to get into building design questions and zoning, we can go there. But\u2026 Smith: Point of order. I agree with Mr. Clement.\u201d Now, Assembly member Clement has proposed anordinancefor the June 10 meeting that would disallow the mayor from participating in debate. It reads, the mayor \u201cshall only speak when needed to recognize Assembly members during debate.\u201d This contradicts the town\u2019s charter. The HainesCharterstates that, \u201cThe mayor may participate in all assembly meeting discussions.\u201d Again, Assembly member Smith and Mayor Morphet at the May 27 meeting. Smith: \u201cYou just sounded very opinionated, Mr. Mayor.\u201d Morphet: \u201cWell, the mayor has opinions. Yes, he does.\u201d The agenda for the next assembly meeting on June 10 is lengthy. Along with Clement\u2019s proposal, it includes approval of a police chief hire and adoption of the FY26 budget. Update: Assembly member Richard Clement withdrew the ordinance at the beginning of the June 10 meeting, stating he would find other ways to shorten the length of meetings.
