Thelegal filing allegesthat registrar Lorena Portillo, in her second year of heading the county\u2019s election department, is not ensuring voter rolls are accurate. \u201cIn Clark County, people are registered to vote from strip clubs, casinos, gas stations and more crazy addresses where it appears no one could reasonably live,\u201d said J. Christian Adams, president of the Public Interest Legal Foundation, which sued along with Nevada voters Frederick H. Kraus and Joey Paulos. The Hustler Erotic Ultra Club, a unit of the late pornographer\u2019s business empire, opened in 2010 and is visible via outdoor signage as a jiggle joint. A worker who answered the phone Thursday affirmed that the business offers topless female entertainment. Photos and declarations in the filing allege voters are registered as \u201cresiding\u201d at an industrial park in Boulder City, as well as a sushi restaurant there. A Meineke Car Care Center franchise in Las Vegas, as well as Trigg Laboratories, a manufacturer of personal lubricants, and downtown staple Binion\u2019s Gambling Hall, one of the oldest casinos, were also documented as \u201chome\u201d addresses of registered voters, along with a US Postal Service branch and a US Department of Agriculture service center. Voting by mail has skyrocketed in Nevada since the pandemic. While polling places are expected to be open statewide, registered voters are sent ballots at their registered home address. The advocacy group says it has notified Clark County of irregularities in addresses since the 2020 election and points to the 2022 midterm contests as an example of the impact \u201cbad\u201d addresses may have on voting. Two years ago, 95,556 ballots were sent to undeliverable or \u201cbad\u201d mailing addresses, representing 5% of the state\u2019s active voter roll, according tofiguresreleased by the secretary of state\u2019s office. Of that number, 69,698 undeliverable ballots were in Clark County. That year, Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto won a second term over former state attorney general Adam Laxalt, a Republican, by 7,928 votes. \u201cWe are asking the court to force Nevada election officials to investigate any improper commercial addresses on the voter roll. We must have this fixed before the 2024 election. Otherwise, some of these strip clubs and casinos will receive ballots in the mail,\u201d Adams said. His organization says it is the nation\u2019s only law firm \u201cdedicated wholly to election integrity\u201d and last month sued Carrie-Ann Burgess, interim voter registrar in Washoe County,allegingvoters listed a Reno city park facility, a downtown office building and a coffee shop as \u201chome\u201d addresses. Stephanie Wheatley, a public information officer for Clark County, said the government \u201cdoes not comment on pending litigation.\u201d Washoe County spokeswoman Bethany Drysdale said via email, \u201cWe follow state and federal law in how we clean our voter rolls.\u201d Follow Follow Follow Public Interest Legal Foundation All Rights Reserved Privacy Policy Terms and Conditions"}
