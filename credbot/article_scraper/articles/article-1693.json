Formally referred to as the \u201cWHO Pandemic Agreement,\u201d the document reflects years of wrangling, cajoling and horse trading among the globalist technocrats. And now that the negotiations are over, their control over the global health space can now be hardwired into international law. There are reasons to be relieved that the document is not as bad as it could have been. As some are pointing out, the latest draft of the agreement has been significantly defanged, with the most egregious language about mandatory enforcement and WHO sovereignty having been removed. Even better, the relevance of this agreement to Americans has been lessened by therecent executive orderwithdrawing the US from the WHO. But for those of us concerned about the establishment of world government, we are not out of the woods yet. There are provisions in this agreement that will allow the would-be global health tyrants to expand beyond the boundaries of the current draft text and to assume the dictatorial powers that their critics (like yours truly) have been warning the treaty would bestow on the WHO. What\u2019s worse, what can be undone with the stroke of Trump\u2019s presidential pen (or robopen) can beredone with the stroke of a presidential pen (or robopen), and it would be the height of na\u00efvet\u00e9 to assume that the next puppet to occupy the Oval Office won\u2019t immediately sign the US back on to the agreement. So, is this the start of a global governmental system of technocratic health control? And, if it is, what does that mean for the future of humanity? In order to answer that question, we\u2019re going to have to go back to the roots of the WHO\u2019s power grab. Andthatstory, it turns out, starts in a most unexpected place . . .

If you think about it \u201cAtlas Shrugged\u201d is the ultimate Elite fantasy where they get rid of everyone else. \u201c\u2026.Thus, superstitions rule, while science based on reason is \u201cjust another religion\u201d\u2026.\u201d That is a rather idealized version of science- science is not really based on reason 90 % of the time.Scientists are human beings and are just as prone to letting their own emotions and emotionally based presuppositions shape their thinking. Add in that 99% of people have no clue about the actual science, not could they recreate the experiments themselves\u2026\u2026an example is evolution which is VERY full of BS stories that are passed thru the Midwits whi accept them like religious acceptance of religious myths.An example was a famous education YTber who told the story of \u201cseeing\u201d speciation wiyh Galapagos finches where some went nocturnal and the others didn\u2019t and in 40 years were \u201cdifferent species\u201d \u2026\u2026 which is utter BS if only because my ancestors and Australian Aborigies didn\u2019t inter breed for more then 40 generations and are not \u201cdifferent species\u201d lolol I definitely was one of those people who thought science was better and different when I was a kid.

Frustrating us from all \u201cnatural\u201d pleasures is a general policy/strategy for years. paul823on 05/21/2025 at 6:29 amAnd right on cue: Singapore\u2019s Draconian Vaccine Mandate: Citizens Face Jail Time for Refusing FORCED Medical Procedures That Do HARM.In a shocking move that tramples on fundamental human rights, Singapore has amended its Infectious Diseases Act (IDA) to force medical procedures on its citizens under threat of imprisonment.

In reality most of the time the elephant (our emotions) actually decide where to go and then the rational part of your mind (the rider) makes up a reason why they steered the elephant over there.Most of the time people DONT think (not would they always get better results if they did) they rationalize their emotional driven actions.Also CS Lewis did say (abolition of man) that just THINKING about doing the good is almost powerless to resist the animal urges UNLESS the good actions are backed up by emotional sentiments- I think the example he used was that he would rather play cards with a guy brought up to think gentlemen dont cheat then a trained moral philosopher brought up by poker hustlers. What happened to the levellers? The real ones ( the band used to rock but their kinda rubbish now) And the Magna Carta is misrepresented today \u2013 it was NOT a document of popular sovereignty or even intended to create equality under law\u2026.. it was an aristocratic pushback to protect the rights of the Aristocracy from central power. \u201c\u2026..Equal rights for all must be achieved by recognizing, respecting the rights of others to dissent, as long as they do the sam\u2026..\u201d That is a Nobel aim , but the issue with it is that at some point on some issues there has to be a decision. That means that at some point the right of dissent becomes \u201cthe right to whine about what\u2019s going to happen whatever you think of it\u201dI really don\u2019t see a way around that issue, because some things exclude each other\u2026. If you can tellMe a way round that I would be honestly interested in hearing it. Voluntaryiston 05/23/2025 at 2:24 amThe Magna Carta opened the door for the evolution of rights, unintentionally.

Once they got that, it spread all the way down to the surf.

They didn\u2019t let the distant British Empire threaten, tax, lie, defraud them. They had become sovereign, brave, self-governing. Not all, just about one third.

What happened to the levellers? The real ones ( the band used to rock but their kinda rubbish now) And the Magna Carta is misrepresented today \u2013 it was NOT a document of popular sovereignty or even intended to create equality under law\u2026.. it was an aristocratic pushback to protect the rights of the Aristocracy from central power. \u201c\u2026..Equal rights for all must be achieved by recognizing, respecting the rights of others to dissent, as long as they do the sam\u2026..\u201d That is a Nobel aim , but the issue with it is that at some point on some issues there has to be a decision.

These cultures were inherently prone to push personal rights because of the places they evolved in. B) when you say\u201c\u2026 For centuries the logic of universal sovereignty evolved into British Common Law\u2026\u201d You are wrong- Common Law was in the culture of the saxons, because freemen were armed and fought against encroachment on their behavior. The common law was what the Normans had to work around when they took over England, 200 yrs before the maga carta\u2026the Norman couldn\u2019t just do whatever they liked without having more trouble then it was worth. Also rights can\u2019t evolve unless they are an artificial construct of society\u2026either rights are objectively real (and thus fixed) or they are fluid and social contracts or constructs.

The reason \u201cmost Americans\u201d joined the winners is because if they did not they would get tarred and feathered or people would burn their house down\u2026. 20% imposed their will on the rest, had loyalists won the Americans would have \u201cjoined them\u201d just as enthusiastically. But my rambling aside I asked if you had a solution to the fact that in society it is not always possible to \u201chave it both ways\u201d \u2013 you can\u2019t have pro and anti slavery people agree to disagree, for example- and how you think that issue can be solved without one side winning and imposing its will on the other the way things have always been\u2026.

In reality most of the time the elephant (our emotions) actually decide where to go and then the rational part of your mind (the rider) makes up a reason why they steered the elephant over there.Most of the time people DONT think (not would they always get better results if they did) they rationalize their emotional driven actions.Also CS Lewis did say (abolition of man) that just THINKING about doing the good is almost powerless to resist the animal urges UNLESS the good actions are backed up by emotional sentiments- I think the example he used was that he would rather play cards with a guy brought up to think gentlemen dont cheat then a trained moral philosopher brought up by poker hustlers.

OlgaVitaon 05/30/2025 at 6:03 pmHey guys! Has anyone looked into the strange, improbably dizzying rocket launch of the Means siblings? Smells fishy and swampy (overnight business success of their glucose monitoring, aka digital surveillance, company; super bestselling first book etc.). Everything about them reeks of Cabal grooming. Even the reversal of genders in their names is a bit strange. Well, anyway. I have been wondering about their out-of-nowhere-to-White-House-inner-circles overnight appearance. Who is behind? I have just finished watching Toxic Nation film. It is co-produced by Joe Polish, self described on his website \u201cthe most sought after marketers alive today\u201d. In the film Joe tells the story of advising Calley Means to connect Donald Trump and RFK Jr to win the elections and create MAHA. Why is Joe in the position to co-ordinate it? What is his agenda and background? I wonder\u2026 Any thoughts? TOXIC NATION documentaryhttps://play.mahafilms.com/watch-toxic-nation?cf_uvid=abd610a07eaa19385cf0c22add0a23dcLog in to Reply Hey guys!

Instead, we see the reverse\u2026.the WHO insisting that covid vaxes are \u2018safe and effective\u2019 and everyone from infancy to the most elderly, should take them. It is interesting to note that, despite smoking being reduced to about 25% of the global population, lung disease and lung cancer has continued to rise. It\u2019s just as interesting to note that not only do we have nicotine receptors in our brains, but that nicotine also enhances testosterone. Why would the WHO want to reduce testosterone globally? I wonder.Log in to Reply Smoking: Aside from the fact that Ireland is probably the #1 \u2018sheep\u2019 that follows globalist directives without any thought, and will probably be the last country attached to the EU, you have to wonder\u2026..Exactly when did the WHO ever decide to prohibit something that was actually bad for you?
