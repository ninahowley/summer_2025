be tricky, especially when it comes to knowing the military ranks in order. Some of the military services -- theArmy,Air ForceandMarine Corps-- have their own enlisted military rank structures; theCoast GuardandNavygenerally mirror each other; and theSpace Forcerelies on the Air Force rank system with the exception of specialists, who replaced airmen. A service member'smilitary rankdoesn't just determine their level of responsibility, but also theirpay. That's why each service's ranks are tied to paygrades in an \"enlisted,\" \"warrant officer\" and \"officer\" number system, written as the letters \"E,\" \"W,\" \"O\" and a number. For example, the lowest military enlisted rank is \"E-1,\" while the highest military officer rank in use is \"O-10.\" While each service may call them something different, they all can be boiled down to \"E\" and \"O.\" The only rank names and abbreviations that are exactly the same across all services who use them are those for warrant officers. Related:Calculate your military pay These military ranks are displayed on service memberuniformsthrough a series of symbols, such as chevrons, stripes, stars and bars. **What Are the Military Ranks?** To learn the military ranks, you need to know what each service specifically calls the E and O levels, their abbreviations andhow they look in the symbols, also known as insignias. For officers, Air Force, Army and Marine Corps symbols are largely the same, while the Navy and Coast Guard generally mirror each other. The rank symbols can vary broadly for enlisted troops, with the Marine Corps and Army having many commonalities, and the Coast Guard and Navy again mirroring each other. Additionally, while all the military services stick to the same paygrade structure, the Navy and Coast Guard organize their enlisted ranks in a \"rate\" system. Learn more aboutNavy enlisted ratesandCoast Guard enlisted rates. **What Is the Highest Military Rank?** Generally, the highest U.S. military rank is O-10, or a four-star general. A five-star rank, created during World War II, was meant to be reserved for wartime or exceptional circumstances. Only nine Americans ever have held this rank. The last living five-star general was Omar Bradley, who died in 1981. **Army Ranks** The best way to understand Army ranks in order is to see each pay grade paired with what the service calls the rank and the abbreviation used by the Army.
