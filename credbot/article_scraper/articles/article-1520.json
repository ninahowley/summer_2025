tswenson@vaildaily.com **Louis C.K. at Gerald R. Ford Amphitheater** Louis C.K. has a long list of comedic accolades to his name, including being a six-time Emmy award-winner and three-time Grammy award-winner. He will take the stage at the Gerald R. Ford Amphitheater on Sunday at 7:30 p.m. with gates opening at 6:30 p.m. The Peabody award-winning comedian, writer and director is on his \u201cRidiculous\u201d tour, which started in April and has dates scheduled through 2026. The tour will span the globe and has already added second shows internationally at venues in Paris, Athens, Istanbul and more. Various pricing is available for lawn seating and reserved pavilion seating. Please note that this comedian\u2019s material is best suited for those 18 and older. This will be a phone-free experience, meaning no one may use cell phones, smart watches, smart accessories, cameras or recording devices in the performance space. Anyone seen using these devices during the performances will be escorted out of The Amp. For more information and to get tickets, visitGRFAVail.com. **Moe\u2019s Original BBQ Crawfish Boil** Moe\u2019s Original BBQ is known for its slow smoked meats, southern fried shrimp Moe boy, catfish and more, but this Saturday it\u2019s all about cracking the crawfish at the Moe\u2019s 4th Annual Crawfish Boil. Moe\u2019s Original BBQ will be serving up crawfish alongside all sorts of fun activities like lawn games, free music and more at its Eagle location. Complement the meal with a sweet tea, a whiskey drink or a cold beer. That\u2019s the type of meal the founders of Moe\u2019s want you to enjoy. They appreciate a slower pace and although they love to showcase their classic dishes, this annual ritual showcases another side of their talents and lets the hospitality of the brand shine. This event starts at 3 p.m., but in true Moe\u2019s style, when the freshly made food is gone, it\u2019s gone, so get there early. For more information, go toMoe\u2019s Original BBQ\u2019s Facebook page. **Improve Comedy Show at Route 6 Caf\u00e9 & Lounge in EagleVail** The Vail Valley Theatre Company is stretching its talents beyond musicals, plays and vocal performances and is now hosting improv.

What topics will be covered? Nobody knows! Not even the performers, which makes it exciting and hilarious for everyone. Doors open at 6:30 p.m. and the show starts at 7:30 p.m. Come early and grab a bite to eat and a drink at the venue and grab a seat for the show. **Support Local Journalism** The Vail Valley Theatre Company was founded in 1987 and the nonprofit organization gives those who have professional acting and singing experience and those who found talents later in life an opportunity to share their gifts on stage. Come on out and support your friends and neighbors doing local comedy this Friday in EagleVail.

For more information, go toVailRec.com. **Outdoor yoga in Eagle on Sundays** Get outside and enjoy Yoga in the Park on Sundays at either the Eagle River Park or Eagle Town Park. Yoga Off Broadway and Vitality have teamed up with the Town of Eagle once again to offer donation-based yoga classes throughout the summer. This Sunday, join Vitality along the Eagle River at the Eagle River Park at 9-10:15 a.m. Next Sunday, join Yoga Off Broadway at the Eagle Town Park at 9-10:15 a.m. Although these are free classes, donations are encouraged. Yoga Off Broadway will be raising money for the Land & Rivers Fund. Vitality will be collecting funds for its High School Vitality Initiative, which sends their yoga instructors into Eagle Valley High School to teach mindfulness and meditation throughout the school year. Learn more atVitalityEagle.comandYogaOffBroadway.com. **Sustainable Clothing Swaps** If you\u2019re doing some spring cleaning and want to donate clothes, or, if you are wondering what to wear to the upcoming Hot Summer Nights concerts, farmers markets, a wedding or the workplace, take part in two clothing swaps going on this weekend. The Eagle Public Library will be accepting clean, gently used clothing at its swap on Saturday. Stop by its location at 600 Broadway Street in Eagle between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. and swap and shop for kids, teens and adults. All the Good Stuff in Edwards is hosting a clothing swap on Sunday from noon to 4 p.m. Bring in a bag of clothes or just come to browse adult, kids and even baby clothes. Samantha Miller of All the Good Stuff hosted a clothing swap last year and said it\u2019s not only a good way to clean out your closet or get a few new outfits, it\u2019s a sustainable way to shop and keep clothing out of the landfill. \u201cThis circular, community-based approach to fashion can give your clothes new life,\u201d Miller said. You know the saying, \u201cone person\u2019s trash is another person\u2019s treasure,\u201d so find some fun clothes at either of these clothing swaps over the weekend. For more information, go to theEagle Valley Library District\u2019s websiteorAll The Good Stuff\u2019s Facebook pagefor more details.
