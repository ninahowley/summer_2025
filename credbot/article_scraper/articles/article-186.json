real-world tales, tips, and insights to demystify what individuals can do to shift their homes and lives to clean electric power. Andrew Garberson isn\u2019t worried about his electric vehicle handling cold winters. He recently drove hisEVto the gym when the temperature where he lives in Des Moines, Iowa, was a biting4degrees Fahrenheit. A polar vortex had brought a brutal wind,\u200b\u201cthe kind that whistles in the cracks of the car doors when you drive.\u201d Garberson relies on his electric truck, a graphite-gray Rivian, for year-round family road trips to see his parents, who live a few hours away.\u200b\u201cMy car will drive200miles in freezing conditions in the Midwest,\u201d saidthe head of growth and researchatRecurrent, a company that aggregates data onbattery healthfrom more than29,000EVs across the United States. Switching from a gas car to anEVisone the biggest actionsan individual can take to reduce their emissions. But EVs have gotten something of abad rep in cold weather. It\u2019s true that they,like gas cars, lose range as temperatures fall: Depending on theEV, the drop can be16% to46%. That loss may be anxiety-provoking, especially forEVowners-to-be. From Garberson\u2019s perspective, the criticisms are overblown. EVs work even in the most bone-chilling climates across the continental U.S., he said. In any case, Recurrent has found that knowledge and experiencego a long way toward relieving those fears. Plenty of frosty regions are embracing electric cars. Just look at Chicago. Despite its freezing winters, it\u2019s one of the top cities forEVregistrations, with more than25,000in the12months ending in June2024, according to Experian\u2019s most recent available data. Outside the U.S., the trend holds, too: In Norway, where temperatures can drop below -4\u02daF, nearly9out of10new cars sold in2024were fully electric. In this article, we\u2019ll dive into how to get the most winter range out of anEV. First up is a keyEVfeature to look for if you\u2019re still shopping. Then, for those who already have an electric car, Garberson shares his top range-extending strategies. **Heat pumps boost winterEVrange** EVrange shrinks in the cold partly because the chemical reaction in their massive lithium-ion batteries slows down. But the biggest reason for winter range decline is the need to keep passengers warm, Garberson said. Gas carsuse the waste heatgenerated from the internal combustion engine for cabin heating. EVs don\u2019t have an engine (they have amotor), so they don\u2019t produce enough accidental heat to keep occupants cozy in frigid weather. Instead, EVs siphon energy from the battery to heat the cab, leaving less for propulsion. EVs can either make heat with an electric-resistance heater, which is like turning on a toaster, or much more efficientlymoveheat from the outdoors into the car using a heat pump. Heat pumpsare famous for their critical role in decarbonizing space heating in buildings. They don\u2019t burn fossil fuel, and they\u2019re typically two to three times as efficient as gas and electric-resistance systems, even below freezing. But the tech has also made its way intoclothes dryersandwater heaters. Now found in some EVs, heat pumps improve range by8% to10%in cold conditions, according to Recurrent. According to Recurrent\u2019sanalysis, electric vehicles with the best winter range tend to have heat pumps, including the Tesla Models X, S,3, and Y; Audi e-tron; and Hyundai Ioniq5and Kona. \u2018I\u2019ll drive what she\u2019s driving\u2019: This campaign wants more women to try EVs **\u2018I\u2019ll drive what she\u2019s driving\u2019: This campaign wants more women to try EVs** **\u2018I\u2019ll drive what she\u2019s driving\u2019: This campaign wants more women to try EVs** **\u2018I\u2019ll drive what she\u2019s driving\u2019: This campaign wants more women to try EVs** Chart: A quarter of cars sold in2025will be battery-powered **Chart: A quarter of cars sold in2025will be battery-powered** **Chart: A quarter of cars sold in2025will be battery-powered** **Chart: A quarter of cars sold in2025will be battery-powered** Chart: Tesla is losing its grip onEVbuyers in theUS **Chart: Tesla is losing its grip onEVbuyers in theUS** **Chart: Tesla is losing its grip onEVbuyers in theUS** **Chart: Tesla is losing its grip onEVbuyers in theUS** It\u2019s worth pointing out that heat pumps themselves are less effective as temperatures drop. Even so, EVs with heat pumps offer better range than those with electric-resistance heating. Recurrent points out that at55\u02daF, a heat pump reduced range by20% while a resistance heater lowered it by33%. As the weather gets colder, the difference in range between EVs with heat pumps and those with resistance heaters shrinks. To be clear, EVs work well in the winter even without heat pumps, Garberson said. His Rivian truck doesn\u2019t have one, and on a day-to-day basis, he doesn\u2019t even notice the decline in range. He charges at home, which makes topping up easy. For longer road trips, cold weather might mean he needs one more charging stop than he normally would. **Strategies to maximize winterEVrange** Heating technology aside, drivers can take steps to get more out of their EVs in the cold. Recurrent\u2019s Garberson offered his top three range-saving strategies for winterEVdrivers. Prewarm yourEVwhile it\u2019s plugged in.Garberson\u2019s garage isn\u2019t climate-controlled, so his vehicle gets chilly when the weather does. About10minutes before he hops in, he uses his car\u2019s app to warm up the cabin. Pulling electricity from the wall outlet means he won\u2019t have to use the battery to bring his car from4\u02daF to a toasty70\u00b0F. Set your charging limit higher.Batteries are happiest when balanced at50% charge, Garberson said. Because huge charge-level swings are harder on the battery, Recurrent recommends keeping it between20% and80% full. But\u200b\u201clet\u2019s eliminate anxiety from the discussion and just charge cars a bit more in cold conditions,\u201d he advised. If you normally charge to70% to keep the battery healthy, as Garberson does, increase it to80% in the winter. When you\u2019re headed to a fast charger, set the destination in the car\u2019sGPS, a feature in most modern EVs.Letting theEVknow will allow it to start preconditioning the battery so it\u2019s ready to charge when you get there. Otherwise, you may need to wait15to20minutes at the charger for the battery to warm up sufficiently, Garberson said.\u200b\u201cIt\u2019s just amazing how [electric] vehicles have been designed over the last few years to help drivers without them even knowing.\u201d One more tip for your kit? Turning on the heated steering wheel and heated seats\u200b\u201cis a far more efficient way\u201d to warm yourself and passengers than heating up the air in the car\u2019s cabin, Garberson said. Once the car is prewarmed and you\u2019re on the road, you could dial down the thermostat and use the targeted heat features to keep you cozy. But most importantly, Garberson added, do what you need in order to keep yourself and your passengers happy. He\u2019s father to a one-year-old, so\u200b\u201crelying on heated seats is not part of my driving equation.\u201d Besides,\u200b\u201cI will admit I am kind of a sucker for creature comforts,\u201d Garberson said.\u200b\u201cI need heat any way I can get it.\u201d Manufacturers provide even more advice on how to extend the winter range of your particularEVmodel, so be sure to check out their online guides. A little planning and know-how can go a long way toward a smoothEVexperience in frosty weather, Garberson said. Winter takes a bite out of his EV\u2019s range, yes, but\u200b\u201cI get by just fine.\u201d Electric vehicles Emissions reduction Guides and how-tos Alison F.
