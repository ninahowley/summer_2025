Our faculty will guide students through the history behind this reactionary movement, tracing the ideas of online figures such as so-called \u201cBronze Age Pervert\u201d to their ideological father, Friedrich Nietzsche. Students will also explore a robust Christian response to these ideas and see how the post-Christian right fails to solve the civilizational challenges posed by the illiberal left. Our faculty for this seminar are Dr. Khalil Habib and Dr. Zachary Ailes. If you have a question about this event, please contact Jane Scharl at[email protected]. **Details** **Speakers** Khalil Habib is Associate Professor of Politics at Hillsdale College, where he teaches political philosophy and American political thought.
