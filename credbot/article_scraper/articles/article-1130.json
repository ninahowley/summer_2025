Their Strange Story Raises Serious Questions.** Experts warn that content creators and social media influencers could be prime targets for foreign actors looking to interfere in Canada\u2019s democracy Since quitting their day jobs and launching a YouTube channel in 2023, Ryan and Tanya Davies\u2019 lives have taken a series of unexpected turns. After starting out making pro-Conservative videos reacting to parliamentary committee hearings, the husband-and-wife team has grown the audience for their Northern Perspective channel to 179,000 subscribers, and now land regular interviews with Conservative MPs and right-wing media personalities. \u201cThis has become an incredibly popular YouTube channel that provides something that I never would have expected a few years ago \u2014 colour commentary on the workings of parliamentary committees,\u201d Conservative MP Garnett Genuisremarked on his podcastlast year. Ryan and Tanya have certainly become influential in Conservative circles. During the recent federal election, Ryan emceed a campaign event for Burlington Conservative candidate Emily Brown, where he and Tanya posed for photos with Andrew Scheer, now the interim Opposition leader. On the eve of the election, Ryan and Tanya even sat down with Pierre and Ana Poilievre for a two-on-two interview about the joys and struggles of parenthood. But the latest turn in the middle-aged couple\u2019s second life as Conservative YouTube influencers was so unexpected it prompted them to call the RCMP, after they claim they were propositioned over email by an individual alleging he could connect them with money from a sanctioned Russian entity. \u201cWe received the unsolicited email shortly after the election and immediately reported it to the RCMP,\u201d Ryan toldPressProgress. \u201cWe\u2019ve since been contacted again by (the RCMP) for additional information and are cooperating fully.\u201d Northern Perspective (YouTube) Ryan and Tanya first publicly shared those allegations in passing, in the middle of athree-hour livestreamearlier this month while refuting several election-denial narratives circulating online. \u201cWe were shocked when we got this email right after the election,\u201d Ryan explained during the livestream. \u201cIn this email, this state actor asked us to, essentially, get paid by the Russian state media.\u201d \u201cRussia wants chaos,\u201d Ryan stressed. \u201cNow what type of chaos do they want? Russia specifically tries to undermine trust in democracy.\u201d \u201cIf we got this email, who else is getting this email?\u201d Tanya asked, to which Ryan agreed: \u201cWho else is putting out content to try to undermine our democracy, that may have actually decided not to report this to the RCMP?\u201d Be AWARE of what is being posted. We were PROPOSITIONED by a Russian Agent, WHO has since been reported to the RCMP, to pay us substantial sums for running content.pic.twitter.com/bZE3TkOKpI \u2014 Northern Perspective (@NorthrnPrspectv)May 5, 2025 According to a copy of the email shared in a laterYouTube video, Ryan and Tanya were contacted by an address associated with a Proton Mail account belonging to a user named \u201c\u041c\u0430\u043a\u0441 \u041b\u0435\u0431\u0435\u0434\u0435\u0432\u201d (Max Lebedev), who appeared to communicate in broken English. \u201cAgency under TASS have noted you have large community,\u201d the email stated. \u201cIf interested in making extra income, let me know and I put you in touch with TASS representative. No need for changing content.\u201d The email concludes: \u201cRU \ud83e\udd1dCA\u201d Northern Perspective (YouTube) Emails sent byPressProgressto the \u201cmaxim.lebedev1997\u201d email account now result in an error message indicating that the \u201caddress does not exist.\u201d Proton Mail, an encrypted email service based in Switzerland, said it is unable to comment on whether the address ever existed or if it was recently deactivated following communication from law enforcement. \u201cWe cannot comment on specific cases for privacy reasons, however abusers of Proton\u2019s services have no place on Proton\u2019s platforms,\u201d a Proton Mail spokesperson toldPressProgress. \u201cOur terms and conditions make it clear that using our products for illegal activity is a violation and those who use our services for such purposes are routinely removed.\u201d \u201cAddress not found\u201d (PressProgress) Ryan, who previously worked as an IT specialist for a federal agency before quitting his job to focus on YouTube full-time, toldPressProgresshe \u201cabsolutely considered the possibility that the email could be a hoax, scam or prank,\u201d but concluded there were enough \u201cred flags\u201d to warrant taking it seriously. Those red flags include, in Ryan\u2019s view, the fact that the email did not resemble a typical scam seeking money and that there were no apparent attempts to extract private information from him. He also found the tone of the email strange, since it begins by insulting him (\u201cYou said Piere would win. Why you say this when you don\u2019t know result yet? Let it be lesson learned\u201d) in an apparent effort to \u201cprovoke an emotional reaction.\u201d Ryan said his suspicions about the email were further validated by the response he received from the RCMP\u2019s National Security Information Network, warning him that the Russian state-owned media entity referenced in the email is named on Canada\u2019sofficial list of sanctioned Russian entities. \u201cPlease be advised that, as per Justice Canada, \u2018TASS\u2019 is listed as an Entity under the Special Economic Measures (Russia) Regulations for Grave Breach of International Peace and Security,\u201d the RCMP\u2019s email to Ryan stated. \u201cAuthentic or not, this kind of contact doesn\u2019t belong in the shadows,\u201d Ryan toldPressProgress. \u201cThe public has a right to know when foreign-linked messaging shows up in Canadian media inboxes.\u201d The RCMP said it is unable to confirm or deny the existence of an investigation unless it results in criminal charges. \u201cShould there be criminal or illegal activities occurring in Canada that are found to have foreign state attribution, it would fall within the RCMP\u2019s mandate to investigate it,\u201d an RCMP spokesperson toldPressProgress. Northern Perspective (YouTube) Aengus Bridgman, a McGill University professor and director of theMedia Ecosystem Observatory, said that while it\u2019s likely impossible to assess the veracity of the email, YouTubers like the Davies have good reason to be concerned about receiving messages like this. \u201cInfluencer capture is a genuine risk,\u201d Bridgman toldPressProgress. Bridgman said although the tone of the email may sound \u201cunprofessional\u201d and \u201choaxy,\u201d the plan floated in the email is more sophisticated than its sender\u2019s \u201clevel of clumsy\u201d suggests. \u201cThis is the key vector of attack,\u201d Bridgman said, noting malicious foreign actors could very plausibly \u201cfind influencers, support them materially and lift up voices\u201d conducive to their \u201cpolitical objectives.\u201d \u201cJust provide them money, lift them up, buy small donations that are untraceable \u2026 a small amount of money can go much further in the Canadian context\u201d compared to the United States. Last year, Tenet Media, afar-right alternative outlet run by Canadian influencers, was indicted by theUS Department of Justiceover allegations their content creators were covertly funded by a Russian state-run media outlet that was sanctioned following Russia\u2019s 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Paid influencers were also central to thecontroversy over Romania\u2019s recent presidential election, whose first-round results were later annulled by the country\u2019s Constitutional Court. DeclassifiedRomanian intelligence documentsalleged hundreds of paid TikTok influencers, boosted by automated bots, made videos supporting afar-right, pro-Russian presidential candidate, after a number of them weresolicited directly over emailby a mysterious \u201caffiliate marketing\u201d agency based in South Africa. In December, the French newspaperLe Mondereported \u201cthousands\u201d of social media influencers in Europe had been approached by Russian proxies. \u201cWe have evidence that confirms that Russia is also trying to manipulate influencers in European countries,\u201d French foreign minister Jean-No\u00ebl Barrot told aFrench parliamentary hearing. \u201cWe call on content creators and their subscribers to be extremely vigilant about these threats to our public debate.\u201d Bridgman said the potential leveraging of domestic influencers by foreign actors would be a complex problem to solve, given the implications for privacy and free speech, but part of the solution is for audiences to start \u201cencouraging a culture of accountability\u201d from influencers. \u201cThe key is to try to figure out a transparency regime around this as much as possible, so that people can make informed decisions when they listen to content creators,\u201d Bridgman said, adding he\u2019s \u201cpleased\u201d the Davies are shining a light on this, even if it turns out the email was a hoax. \u201cEven if it\u2019s not true, sharing this information is useful because it alerts people to this possibility of foreign interference through influencers. And if it is true, it is also good because he\u2019s calling it out.\u201d Northern Perspective (Facebook) For his part, Ryan believes his actions posting videos on YouTube about this may have helped disrupt a Russian foreign-influence operation targeting Canadians. \u201cI believe our responsible disclosure of the issue most likely dissuaded whomever this was from acting further,\u201d the Conservative YouTuber toldPressProgress. \u201cThe number-one way to combat foreign interference is to shine sunlight on it.\u201d Correction:An earlier version of this story identified Ryan and Tanya\u2019s last name as \u201cMitchell.\u201d In fact, their last name is Davies. Ryan Davies explained that he was mistakenly introduced with the wrong last name in an appearance on Conservative MP Garnett Genuis\u2019 podcast last fall.
