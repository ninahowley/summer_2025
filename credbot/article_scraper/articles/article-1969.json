Hammond|Nov 16, 2019|News & Analysis,Asia Pacific,Featured,Politics,US|4| The United Nations Children\u2019s Fund has dangerously praised the Maldives legislature for passing a bill that fundamentally violates human rights. The parliament of the Republic of Maldives on November 14 passed abilleffectively outlawing the exercise of the right to informed consent, one of the most fundamental ethics in medicine. If ratified, according to multiple Maldives online news sources, the new law would make it illegal for parents to decline certain pharmaceutical products for their children. Concerningly, the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) has praised the Maldives legislature for passing the bill, which has been promoted as bringing the country into closer compliance with the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC). The authoritarian bill is being euphemistically called the \u201cChild Rights Protection Bill\u201d. The implicit underlying concept is that children have a \u201cright\u201d to receive certain pharmaceutical products and so parents cannot be allowed to choose for their children not to receive those risk-carrying products. This framework overlooks the fact that children do not have enough knowledge and understanding to be able to do their own risk-benefit analysis, which is why such decisions must be made for them bytheir parentsuntil they reach such age as to be able to reasonably make their own choice. **** **** **** Of course, children won\u2019t be given the choice, either, if news reports are accurate and the bill is ratified into law. Government bureaucrats will be the ones making that decision on children\u2019s behalf, despite having none of the specialized knowledge of the individual child that is possessed by the child\u2019s parents working in consultation with the child\u2019s doctor\u2014knowledge required to be able to conduct the necessary risk-benefit analysis for that individual. UNICEF is apparently unconcerned with world governments systematically violating the right to informed consent of their citizens. The propagandistic language of children\u2019s rights being used to push this authoritarian agenda serves to mask how the Maldives government is itself claiming to have a \u201cright\u201d to force risk-carrying pharmaceutical products on children against the will of their parents. In effect, the government will be subjecting every child member of the population to a mass uncontrolled experiment without their informed consent. In atweetimmediately following its passage, UNICEF described the bill as a \u201ccelebration-worthy milestone for the Maldives, as we mark the 30th anniversary of the #CRC.\u201d The passage of the two important bills for children \u2013 The Child Rights Protection Bill, and the Juvenile Justice Bill is a key and celebration-worthy milestone for the Maldives, as we mark the 30th anniversary of the#CRC.https://t.co/luMkJSiOzR \u2014 UNICEF Maldives (@UNICEFMaldives)November 14, 2019 TheSun Online, a Maldives media outlet,reportedthat the bill passed unanimously and \u201cwould make it mandatory for parents to vaccinate children and outlaw the option of rejecting vaccinations by the parents.\u201d The report self-contradictorily added that \u201cThe new legislature on child rights protection is designed to remedy the inconsistencies between the current Child Rights Protection Act\u2014enacted in 1991\u2014and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.\u201d That report was alsopublishedin short form byOne Online, another Maldives news site. TheMaldives Independentsimilarlyreportedthat the parliament had \u201cpassed with unanimous consent a new child protection law with provisions to make vaccination mandatory\u201d. Under the law, parents \u201cwould not be legally allowed to deny vaccinating their children\u201d. The euphemistic language being used to describe the government\u2019s agenda to forcibly vaccinate children is that they have a \u201cright to care\u201d. This aspect of the bill is being passed under cover of other provisions intended to bring the country closer in line with the protections under international law for the rights of the child, such as by prohibiting child marriage and criminalizing failure to report child abuse. While enacting protections for children from some forms of child abuse, however, the government itself would be committing child abuse systematically on a massive scale by forcing upon children risk-carrying pharmaceutical products that can and do cause permanent injury or even death to some children. \u201cOnce ratified,\u201d theMaldives Independentadded, \u201cthe new law will replace the 1991 child protection law and bring the domestic legal framework in line with the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.\u201d But that is not true. On the contrary, the outlawing of informed consent is a gross violation of fundamental human rights and is inconsistent with international law. **The Inviolable Right to Informed Consent** TheConvention on the Rights of the Childrecognizes that \u201cthe equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world\u201d. Its aim is to \u201cpromote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom\u201d. The Convention acknowledges the child\u2019s right to \u201cbe cared for by his or her parents.\u201d States are obligated to \u201crespect the rights and duties of the parents\u201d, which certainly includes making decisions affecting the child\u2019s health. The Convention explicitly recognizes that \u201cprimary responsibility for the upbringing and development of the child\u201d belongs not to the state but the parents. The role of the state, instead, is merely to \u201crender appropriate assistance to parents\u201d, not to make decisions affecting the child on their behalf and without respect for their parental rights. The cheerleading from UNICEF also comes despite the fact that the right to informed consent has been explicitly recognized under international conventions and treaties as one of the most fundamental ethics in medicine\u2014an inviolable human right that no government may legislate away. In the wake of World War II and revelations about the Nazis\u2019 medical experimentation upon unwilling human subjects, the very first medical ethic recognized under theNuremberg Codeis that \u201cThe voluntary consent of the human subject is absolutely essential.\u201d The use of \u201cforce, fraud, deceit, duress, overreaching, or other ulterior form of constraint or coercion\u201d is absolutely prohibited as violating the individual\u2019s right \u201cto exercise free power of choice\u201d. Additionally, the subject of any medical intervention \u201cshould have sufficient knowledge and comprehension of the elements of the subject matter involved as to enable him to make an understanding and enlightened decision.\u201d The 1966United Nations Covenant on Civil and Political Rightssimilarly states that \u201cno one shall be subjected without his free consent to medical or scientific experimentation.\u201d The updated 2002 edition of theInternational Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical Research Involving Human Subjects, the guidelines of which are promulgated by the World Health Organization (WHO), explicitly recognizes that the individual subjected to medical intervention must be \u201ccapable of giving informed consent\u201d. If the individual isn\u2019t capable of making that choice, the intervention requires \u201cthe permission of a legally authorized representative\u201d\u2014which in the case of children means the parents. The 2005Universal Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rightsstates that \u201cAny preventive, diagnostic and therapeutic medical intervention is only to be carried out with the prior, free and informed consent of the person concerned, based on adequate information.\u201d In no case should decisions by authorities \u201csubstitute for an individual\u2019s informed consent.\u201d The Convention on the Rights of the Child also says that state parties are responsible, without prejudice to the rights of parents, to take appropriate measures to \u201cdiminish infant and child mortality\u201d. The Maldives bill would also violate that clause of the CRC, too, if scientific studies are any indication. **The DTP Vaccine\u2019s Negative Effect on Childhood Mortality** Although the popular belief\u2014and the message conveyed by government health officials\u2014is that all vaccines are \u201csafe and effective\u201d, the truth is that there is an egregious lack of properly designed safety studies for these pharmaceutical products. One illustrative example is the diphtheria, tetanus, and whole cell pertussis (DTP) vaccine, which isroutinely administeredto children in the Maldives. The DTP vaccine was never studied for its effect on childhood mortality in clinical trials. Government policy makers always justassumedthat by reducing incidence of the target diseases it would reduce childhood mortality. But that\u2019s not what the scientific evidence tells us. On the contrary, the best scientific evidence to date strongly indicates that the DTP vaccineincreasesthe risk of death. Numerous studies have found it to be associated with a significantlyincreasedrate of childhood mortality. The authors of astudyinto the DTP vaccine\u2019s effect on childhood mortality published in the journalEBioMedicinein 2017 summarized the situation bluntly: \u201cAll currently available evidence suggests that DTP vaccine may kill more children from other causes than it saves from diphtheria, tetanus or pertussis. Though a vaccine protects children against the target disease it may simultaneously increase susceptibility to unrelated infection.\u201d The key finding of that study was that \u201cDTP was associated with 5-fold higher mortality than being unvaccinated.\u201d The authors further commented that, \u201cUnfortunately, DTP is the most widely used vaccine, and the proportion who receives DTP is used globally as an indicator of the performance of national vaccination programs.\u201d \u201cIt should be of concern\u201d, the researchers also remarked, \u201cthat the effect of routine vaccinations on all-cause mortality was not tested in randomized trials.\u201d The term in the literature used to describe such unintended consequences of vaccination is \u201cnon-specific effects\u201d. Anotherstudypublished inFrontiers in Public Healthsimilarly pointed out that \u201cAll studies of the introduction of DTP have found increased overall mortality.\u201d The association is particularly strong for girls. The best studies show \u201cfour to five times higher mortality\u201d for DTP-vaccinated children. Anexpert reviewof the available studies published in June 2019 by theVaccine Science Foundationexpressed the concern that \u201cit is impossible to predict what happens in terms of susceptibility to infections in general, of all types, when the immune system is being stimulated through vaccination\u201d. Concern was also expressed that the WHO had attempted to dismiss the studies and acted in a manner \u201cinconsistent and biased towards positive effects of vaccines. When a result pleases the WHO, it can be accepted, but not when a result does not please the WHO.\u201d Conflicts of interest within the WHO is another area of concern. Of the fourteen experts tasked by the WHO to examine the evidence with respect to the DTP vaccine\u2019s effect on mortality, eight \u201chad relevant conflicts of interest in relation to companies producing vaccines\u201d. Three \u201ceven had ties to GlaxoSmithKline\u201d, one of the manufacturers of DTP vaccines. While the WHO chose not to see any conflicts of interest, \u201cresearch has overwhelmingly demonstrated that people become influenced when they have financial ties to drug companies, even when these ties are not directly related to the drugs or vaccines in question.\u201d The review observed the commonsense principle that \u201cexpert committees that give advice on immunization programs should not be involved with their re-assessment when research has demonstrated that a vaccine might increase total mortality.\u201d Additionally, \u201cno one should be allowed to have financial conflicts of interest in relation to the pharmaceutical industry.\u201d However, \u201cThis is not the case for WHO committees.\u201d The review further observed: It is the duty of a manufacturer of a drug or vaccine to demonstrate in randomized trials that it works and has a positive benefit to harm balance. This has not been done for the DTP vaccine. Not a single randomized trial has been carried out, but the vaccine is nonetheless on the market. This has created the odd situation that the burden of proof has been reversed. The WHO recommends the use of the vaccine and seems to require very convincing evidence that it increases mortality before any action will possibly be taken. Given the widespread use of the vaccine around world, the \u201cneed for randomized trials\u201d is \u201can urgent ethical imperative.\u201d In conclusion, \u201cthe best available evidence . . . tells us that it is likely that the DTP vaccine increases total mortality in low-income countries\u201d, and therefore \u201cno one should be offered this vaccine without full informed consent that includes information that the vaccine is likely to increase total mortality.\u201d The Maldives government is engaging in science denialism by ignoring that sound and medically ethical recommendation. **More Vaccines Doesn\u2019t Equal Better Health** It\u2019s also worth pointing out that although the United States has themost highly vaccinatedchildhood population in the world and spends more per capita on health care for children, it also consistentlyranks lastamong developed countries for its rate ofinfant mortality. Far from the highly vaccinated US population being healthy, as a 2013reportfrom the National Research Council and Institute of Medicine noted, \u201cAmericans die sooner and experience more illness than residents in many other countries.\u201d Astudypublished in 2011 estimated that at least 43 percent of the childhood population\u201432 million children\u2014suffered from at least one chronic health condition. According to areportpublished in 2013 by Save the Children, \u201cIn the industrialized world, the United States has by far the most first-day deaths. . . . An estimated 11,300 newborn babies die each year in the United States on the day they are born. This is 50 percent more first-day deaths than all other industrialized countries combined.\u201d Relevantly, the CDC also recommends that the hepatitis B (HepB) vaccine be routinely administered to all newborn babies in the USon the first day of their livesregardless of the fact that most infants arenot at significant riskfrom this virus, which is mostly transmitted through sex or intravenous injections, and the fact that routine screening is done to determine whether the mother is a carrier. This places the majority of children at unnecessary risk of harm from the vaccine, which, like many other vaccines used in children, contains aluminum, a known neurotoxin thataccumulates in the brain. While human studies haven\u2019t been done to determine the neurotoxicological effects of the HepB vaccine on infants, rodentstudieshavefoundthat the vaccine causesneurodevelopmental harm. The HepB vaccine isamong thosethat would be forced upon children against their parents\u2019 will\u00ad if the Maldives bill is ratified. Another is the live oral polio vaccine (OPV), whichnow causes more cases of paralysisthan the wild virus. It would be superfluous to provide other examples. **A Dangerous Precedent** All vaccines carry the risk of serious harm or even death. Furthermore, certain children are at greater risk of being harmed by vaccines, and these children are placed on the sacrificial altar in the name of \u201cpublic health\u201d when vaccines are universally mandated. For example, the US government hasacknowledgedthat vaccines can cause brain damage manifesting as symptoms of autism in children with mitochondrial disorders. The US government has also granted legal immunity to manufacturers of vaccines recommended for routine use in children by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The parent agency of the CDC, the Department of Health and Human Services, administers a Vaccine Injury Compensation Program that effectivelyshifts the financial burden for vaccine injuriesaway from the pharmaceutical industry and onto the taxpaying consumers. To obtain licensure by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), vaccine manufacturers are not required to conduct long-term, randomized, placebo-controlled studies comparing health outcomes between an experimental group who receive the vaccine and a control group who are instead given an inert placebo. Since the pharmaceutical companies aren\u2019t required to, they don\u2019t. Government policymakers in the US and countries all over the world are essentially subjecting their entire populations to amass uncontrolled experimentwithout individuals\u2019 informed consent. What government officials in the Maldives evidently hope to do is to take this one step further and ensure that informed parents who judge that the potential benefits of a given vaccine would not outweigh the potential harms arenotallowed to choose for their child tonotbe experimented upon. For an agency of the United Nations to endorse a government policy that so egregiously violates the right to informed consent sets a worrying precedent encouraging a trend of increasing totalitarianism that threatens both public health and fundamental human rights.
