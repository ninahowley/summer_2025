The Conservancy is proud to honor Vivian Day and John Stroh III, alongside Robert Alan Davis with Shimmer Awards for their myriad contributions to the successful and ongoing revitalization of the Detroit Riverfront. Robert Alan Davis has played a pivotal role in the Detroit Riverfront revitalization as a founding Conservancy board member during his tenure as a leader at the Michigan Department of Transportation, where he worked on Milliken State Park and Harbor, Mt. Elliott Park, Robert C. Valade Park and the Riverwalk connection across the Uniroyal factory site. Vivian Day and John Stroh III have championed the development of the Detroit Riverfront for decades. John Stroh has played a pivotal role in the Conservancy since the organization\u2019s inception as a founding board member who has served on several committees. He and Vivian have attended countless Conservancy events throughout the years, and in the fall of 2023, they were honored to name the Christopher Stroh Plaza at Gabriel Richard Park in memory of their son.
