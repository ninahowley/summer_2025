People interact with fire in complicated ways, and building a better relationship between the two means taking both fire behaviour and human behaviour into account.Sometimes that means getting out ahead of wildfire misinformation, which can have deadly consequences in emergencies. This week, video producer Manuel Baechlin and Prairies reporter Drew Anderson collaborated to publish a short videoon our YouTubeandTikTok channelsto help separate fiction from fact. (Yes, a lot of wildfires are sparked by humans; no, that usually doesn\u2019t mean arson. And yes, aggressively suppressing fires to protect logging industry interests contributes to the problem.)I hope you\u2019ll keep thelink to the videohandy for the next time you spot a piece of wildfire misinformation that threatens to spread!And if you do take on the fight against false narratives, you won\u2019t be alone. Last week, Matt reported onnew efforts by the BC Wildfire Serviceto engage with misinformation on social media, leading with kindness, compassion and, of course, facts.Learning how to live with fire, and even sometimes embrace it, is complicated \u2014 but possible. We can do it if we work together. The Narwhal will be keeping a close watch on wildfires across the country through the summer and beyond.Bookmark this pageto check out our latest coverage.Take care and spark compassion,Jacqueline RonsonAssistant editor **Got bill questions?** \u201cCanadian politicians are in a schoolyard-style bragging competition about shortening approval times.\u201d That\u2019s how Ontario bureau chief Elaine Anselmi summed up the political moment, as Ontario and B.C. both make moves to fast-track major projects, and Prime Minister Mark Carney promises national legislation to the same end.In B.C.,Bill 15 was just passed, and Ontario ismoving forward on Bill 5.
