As they filed charges against him and a girlfriend who worked in a lab at the University of Michigan. (United States District Court For The Eastern District Of Michigan via AP) DETROIT (AP) \u2014 A Chinese scientist was arrested while arriving in the U.S. at the Detroit airport, the second case in days involving the alleged smuggling of biological material, authorities said Monday. The scientist is accused of shipping biological material months ago to staff at a laboratory at the University of Michigan. The FBI, in a court filing, described it as material related to certain worms and requires a government permit. \u201cThe guidelines for importing biological materials into the U.S. for research purposes are stringent, but clear, and actions like this undermine the legitimate work of other visiting scholars,\u201dsaid John Nowak, who leads field operations at U.S. Customs and Border Protection. The scientist was interviewed and arrested Sunday after arriving on a flight from China, where she is pursuing an advanced degree at Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan. She planned to spend a year completing a project at the University of Michigan. Her shipments, including an envelope stuffed inside a book, were intercepted last year and earlier this year and opened by authorities, the FBI said. The court filing doesn\u2019t indicate whether the FBI believes the biological material was risky, though U.S. Attorney Jerome Gorgon Jr. said smuggling\u201cthreatens our security.\u201d The scientist remains in custody awaiting a bond hearing Wednesday. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t strike me as something that is dangerous in any way. But there are rules to ship biological material,\u201dsaid Michael Shapira, a biologist at the University of California, Berkeley, who read the court filing and spoke to The Associated Press. The government last week charged two Chinese scientists who are accused of conspiring to smuggle a toxic fungus into the U.S. One was turned around at the Detroit airport and sent back to China last year, while the other, a researcher at the University of Michigan, was arrested. She remains in custody. **Newsletter** **Local** **Local** **Superiorland Yesterdays** **Superiorland Yesterdays** 30 years ago MARQUETTE \u2014 After the passing of a new state school spending bill, time students spend on the ... **New cell phone scam afoot** **New cell phone scam afoot** MARQUETTE \u2014 There is a new cell phone scam making its way across the state of Michigan, including right here in ... **Dance scheduled in Rock** **Dance scheduled in Rock** ROCK \u2014 A dance will be held at the Rock Community/Senior Center, located at 3892 W.
