The council voted 7-2 for a compromise budget that also adds crucial funding forbrush managementto prevent wildfires, asafe parking lot for homeless familiesat the former Central Elementary and a backlog of neededflood channel clearing. The new $2.15 billion general fund budget, which covers the fiscal year that starts July 1, also restores money for many public restrooms in city parks anduses county money to restore funding for beach fire rings. The city\u2019s independent budget analyst expressed concern about all the funding restorations and new spending, warning council members that many of the new revenues are uncertain and based on optimism. The analyst, Charles Modica, said the budget makes San Diego particularly vulnerable to an economic recession, which would shrink tax revenues and force immediate cuts or significantly deplete the city\u2019s roughly $200 million in remaining reserves. Mayor Todd Gloria said Tuesday night that all the new spending and related moves by the council make him unsure whether he\u2019ll sign the budget or try to make changes. The mayor can usehis line-item veto powerto eliminate new spending and make other changes. But the council can override such vetoes with votes from six members \u2014 one member fewer than approved the budget Tuesday. The primary sources of the new revenue, which total about $10 million, would be plans to startcharging for parking in Balboa Park and at the San Diego Zoosooner than expected, charging credit card fees at city parking meters and allowing digital billboards in the city. The budget restorations also rely on $2.7 million in cuts to management positions, including two communications officials and program coordinators and deputy directors in several other departments. The management cuts aggressively target the mayor\u2019s office, including a confidential secretary position budgeted at $133,000 and two deputy chief operating officer jobs budgeted at $400,000 each in total pay. Deputy City Attorney Leslie Fitzgerald said it\u2019s unclear whether the council has the power to be so precise about job cuts. \u201cUnder the city charter, the council has the authority to set the budget, including funding or defunding certain positions,\u201d she said. \u201cHowever, the charter does not give the council the authority to direct the mayor to fill positions or fire employees in those positions. That authority rests solely with the mayor.\u201d Tuesday\u2019s budget vote culminates months of debate and public protest prompted mostly by Gloria\u2019s proposals to shut down all city libraries on Sundays and Mondays and to significantly reduce recreation center hours. The budget approved Tuesday leaves the Sunday library closures in place but restores Monday hours fully at 16 of the city\u2019s 37 branches, many of them in low-income neighborhoods. The budget completely restores all proposed cuts to recreation centers. It also fully restores funding for boating and other activities at all city reservoirs, including Lake Murray and Lake Miramar. The main architects of the compromise budget \u2014 Councilmembers Henry Foster, Sean Elo-Rivera, Joe LaCava and Kent Lee \u2014 said at a Tuesday afternoon news conference the last-minute changes help prevent damage to low-income areas. \u201cWe\u2019re restructuring management, responsibly generating revenue, and as a result we\u2019re restoring parks, libraries and lakes,\u201d Lee said. \u201cThese changes are targeted, tactical and tailored to help San Diego families who rely on the city the most.\u201d Elo-Rivera said the efforts to boost revenue are crucial and timely. \u201cThis budget is not only responsible, but it meets the needs of our community at an incredibly trying time,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are asking visitors to this city to chip in when they are visiting a treasure like Balboa Park, to no longer treat our city like a free playground. While we\u2019re not restoring everything we\u2019d like to restore, this is a giant step forward.\u201d Councilmember Jennifer Campbell, who was joined in opposition by Councilmember Vivian Moreno, said she has major concerns about the reliability of the new revenues proposed Tuesday by her colleagues. \u201cI am not convinced that entire list of things can be paid for in this particular budget,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cI don\u2019t want us to get into a situation where we are spending much more than we have.\u201d Moreno said she supports most of Tuesday\u2019s changes but voted \u201cno\u201d because the budget doesn\u2019t includeadequate money to plan future stormwater channel clearingto prevent floods. Modica, the budget analyst, expressed similar concerns to Campbell. \u201cI\u2019ve highlighted the potential risks associated with these revenues,\u201d he said. \u201cThey may come to fruition. If they do not, I do want to be clear that we will be forced to tap into reserves or have cuts in the middle of the year.\u201d Modica also talked about a possible recession. \u201cThis risk of an economic downturn, or even a full recession, is heightened,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is very little buffer built into the budget to be able to absorb continued declines (in revenue).\u201d Modicahas also expressed concernsabout budget projections he says are questionable, such as estimates that police and fire overtime pay will be $20 million lower in the new fiscal year than in the ongoing fiscal year. A spokesperson for the mayor, Rachel Laing, said in a news release that the mayor is also concerned about the budget the council adopted Tuesday. \u201cThe council added tens of millions of dollars in new spending and changes, many of which raised concerns from both the independent budget analyst and the City Attorney\u2019s Office,\u201d Laing said. The mayor has five days either to sign the budget or to issue line-item vetoes. \u201cOver the next several days, the mayor and his team will closely review the council\u2019s amendments to ensure the final budget meets the level of fiscal responsibility this moment demands, especially given the current economic uncertainty and global instability,\u201d Laing said. The budget angst this spring is the result of San Diego facing itslargest projected deficit in more than a decade\u2014 a $258 million gap that increased to $350 million as revenues declined this spring. The deficit has been blamed on a series of pay raises totaling about 23% that were given to most employees in 2023 and to voters\u2019 November rejection of a one-cent sales tax hike that would have raised $400 million a year. Gloria closed the gap with $100 million in cuts, with between $150 million and $200 million in new revenues from parking and other fees and by canceling $64 million in scheduled reserve contributions. The 16 library branches slated for full Monday service under the budget approved Tuesday are Allied Gardens, downtown, Carmel Valley, Logan Heights, Oak Park, City Heights, Rolando, Linda Vista, Mira Mesa, Point Loma, Rancho Bernardo, San Ysidro, Skyline, Valencia Park, North Park and University Heights. **Share this:** Click to share on X (Opens in new window)X Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Facebook Click to print (Opens in new window)Print Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window)Email Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)Reddit **RevContent Feed** **Most Popular** Need a homeless shelter bed?
