First assessments point to a record high value of precipitation in a wide area, as the result of a \u201cVb weather condition\u201d, named after the historical classification of the tracking directions of low-pressure fields in Europe. In a Vb weather condition, a low pressure area tracks to theMediterraneanSea, thereafter north-eastward and ends usually in the Baltic region of Europe. A Vb condition is very often associated with much rain in Mid-and Eastern Europa and flood events e.g. 1997 (River Oder) and 2002 (River Elbe). However, an \u201cAttribution study\u201d appeared only a few days afterwards. It\u2019s Core message about the event (cited in media) was: \u201cThe combined change, attributable to human-induced climate change, is roughly a doubling in likelihood and a 7% increase in intensity.\u201d To evaluate the robustness of the claim, thefull textof the attribution study was downloaded. The meteorological classification of the event in question involves several atmosphere dynamics features. The triggering event was an \u201cArctic Outbreak\u201d, an extreme northward displacement of the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) was also involved. To make the things worse, there was a stable blocking high pressure field north of the area in question, so the precipitation area was relatively stationary and could not move north towards the Baltic Sea as usual. The key question is whether the thermodynamic element (related to warming from \u201cclimate change\u201d) contributing to the events described can actually be quantified with some robustness, as it was claimed in the attribution study. The attribution study describes trend analyses of observational data (E-Obs.) and (weather) model-observational reanalysis data (ERA5) for the time 1950-2023 (2024). The data used are available via the \u201cKNMI Climate Explorer\u201d permitting one to evaluate the numbers. The study uses the GMST GISS Dataset to describe the connection of heavy rain in Mid Europe to a warmer world. The attribution study states: \u201cAll datasets show similar trends across the region, with increasing trends\u2026\u201d (see section 3.1) The same dataset is used here, but averaged over the European area in question rather than globally. The mean temperature anomaly 1950-2023 in the region 20\u00b0W-25\u00b0E; 35\u00b0N-65\u00b0N is shown below. This region includes more land (which is faster warming than the ocean) than the roughly 30% global mean land fraction. Fig.1: The temperature time series (GISS) in the European area. The figure was generated with the KNMI Climate Explorer. The (not too surprising) observation: From 1950 to about 1981 the temperatures did not show any rise. Anthropogenic warming, manifested in the mean temperatures, started around 1981, not 1950. To calculate the trends in the \u201cRX4days\u201d precipitation (which is the accumulation of 4 days of precipitation) the data for ERA5 were recalculated for 1950-2024: Fig.2: The outstanding event in September 2024 is clearly visible. It makes the trendslope 1981-2024 ( green) positive (a \u201cone year trend\u201d), for 1981-2023 (black) it\u2019s zero. The figure was generated with ChatGPT. The ordinary least square (OLS)-Trend 1950-2024 (blue) is robustly positive (p=0.025) as the attribution study states. However, it did not mention that the trend become insignificant after the late 1960s when calculated to 2024. If the increasing trend from 1950 to 2024 were attributable to the \u201chuman induced climate change\u201d after 1981, one would NOT expect that the trend slope to 2024 is completely insignificant (p=0,32) and for 1981-2023 (black) it\u2019s zero. In the light of these findings the OLS-trends to 2024 might be more a result of internal variability. Over the period 1950-1981 with no warming (see Fig. 1), the most positive trend slope (orange) of RX4day was 2 times steeper than in 1981-2024, when the forced warming was observed. The study evaluates the climate models used for the attribution analysis. Many models belong to the CMIP6 family. It iss well known that those models face substantial difficulties when it comes to atmosphere dynamics owing to their low resolution. The Multi Model Mean shows no skill in the study area (46\u00b0N- 52\u00b0N; 11\u00b0E- 24\u00b0E) with respect of the model-observation (E-Obs.) spatial correlation for precipitation. Fig.3: The spatial correlation between precipitation of the CMIP6 Multi Model Mean with the Observations (E-Obs.) for the warm seasons 1975-2023. The figure was generated with the KNMI Climate Explorer. A meaningful correlation should be a prerequisite for blaming the anthropogenic warming as simulated in the CMIP6 models, for a distinct extreme precipitation event based on model comparisons with the real world. In Table 4.1 of the attribution study the models were evaluated, some of them (only a few) were labelled as \u201cgood\u201d when it comes to precipitation. The \u201cIPSL-CM6A-LR\u201d model was labelled as \u201creasonable\u201d. The spatial correlation 1950-2023 to E-OBS observations during months where Vb-events were observed is shown below, also for the \u201cgood\u201d model \u201cEC Earth 3\u201d, both with below 20%, indistinguishable from random noise: Fig. 4: There is no skill (white for the zero- correlation) in selected models of the study. The figure was generated with the KNMI Climate Explorer. Neither \u201cIPSL-CM6A-LR\u201d (left) nor in \u201cEC Earth3\u201d (right), labelled as \u201cgood\u201d in the study, have any skill when it comes to the spatial correlation of precipitation with the real world. Nor does the model MPI-ESM1-2LR (\u201creasonable\u201d in Table 4.1 of the study), but not shown here. In the end it seems dubious to attribute an extreme precipitation event to climate change when using the CMIP6 models. The ocean warming is for sure a source for more evaporation and also for more rain, although the proportional rise in precipitation with warming is only a fraction of the rise in evaporation. However, the influence of atmosphere dynamics is overwhelming and hampers the attribution of single extreme weather events based on thermodynamics arguments. Conclusion After a closer look, neither the trend analysis nor the model-observation comparison supports the conclusions of the attribution study. The issue of unsound extreme weather event attribution studies is not limited to extreme precipitation. Asthis recent articleby Roger Pielke Jr explains, attribution studies for all types of extreme weather event are in general highly dubious, and appear to be undertaken more for \u201cpolitical\u201d than for scientific purposes. **Share this:** Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window)Email Click to share on X (Opens in new window)X Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Facebook Click to print (Opens in new window)Print Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)Reddit Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Tumblr **Like this:** **994 responses to \u201cDid global warming make the heavy precipitation in Mid Europe in September 2024 more likely?\u201d** Bill Fabrizio|October 12, 2024 at 4:41 pm|Thank you, Frank.Loading...

Britain is shutting down nuclear plants, they will test BABs theory about batteries taking up the slack. Hint: Britain will go down hill economically due to this id ee ot ic decision. But to others, it flies in the face of what some economists have suggested we should really be aiming for: energy abundance. One senior energy industry source says: \u201cWe are turning off consumers and industries because we can\u2019t provide the power that\u2019s needed. \u201cIt\u2019s like South Africa [which has frequent power cuts], but people here are trying to make a virtue out of it. Demand side response is a euphemism \u2013 what it really means is supply-side failure.\u201d Tone Langengen, a net zero expert at the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change and a former energy department official, warned against moves towards anything that resembles \u201cstifling demand\u201d for power earlier this year. Along with another academic, she argued that Britain should instead aim for \u201cenergy abundance\u201d by building a large fleet of new nuclear power stations. https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/ar-AA1saLOz joe K|October 13, 2024 at 10:29 pm|Lets see what the LCOE costs really are for wind when there is no fossil fuel electric generation plants covering for their down days.Maybe marc jacobson can explain how you only need 4 hour battery storage for 100% renewable system since if you ever need more backup storage all you have to do is hook up additional 4 hour back in a series.

Hi Dan B: Of course the thermodynamic issues you describe are true, this is also stated in the main post. However, the event was attributed by the study in question, including some quantitiets. It was this Vb flood in Mideurope. The main post questions this, not the thermodynamics.best Frank Dan B|November 4, 2024 at 1:14 pm|the logic of the main post verges on nonsensical because, as i said, a lack of correlation between warming and more intense precip events in a single location in no way undermines that when an extreme event happened, the root cause was the warming climate. Such events had not yet occurred previously in that one location. Which is entirely expected as we\u2019re still early on in our new climate and such evvents are relatively rare. this is 100% pseudoscience intended to raise doubt about warming leading to more intense precipitation events.Loading... the logic of the main post verges on nonsensical because, as i said, a lack of correlation between warming and more intense precip events in a single location in no way undermines that when an extreme event happened, the root cause was the warming climate.

For August I had predicted cool and wet from around the 8th, which Scotland got, but England was drier and milder.For September I saw only a brief negative NAM signal in the second week, and a return to a positive signal from week three. The solar wind speed did increase during that period, which would normally mean positive NAM (AO/NAO), but the AO/NAO went stronger negative. There were solar proton storms on the 9th and 14th, which according to the research would in the spring season strengthen the polar vortex, promoting positive NAM conditions. So unless that effect is reversed in autumn, I am still stumped as to what caused the deeper negative AO/NAO later in September.https://www.solen.info/solar/images/swind.pngLoading...Ireneusz Palmowski|October 16, 2024 at 11:41 am|It all adds up.

Turn on your phone \u2013 you will see a battery generating electical energy from chemically stored energy. A gas or coal power plant also converts chemical energy into electrical energy. Nonetheless, my original comment was about the energy mix of the future, and EIA shows the growth of solar (58%), batteries (23%), and wind (13%) are all much faster than FFs (4%) and nuclear (2%).Also, you failed to comment on the fact that FFs and nuclear ADD to the earth\u2019s direct heat loading, which solar panels (and wind) do not, even though that was your original silly complaint about solar panels. Might also compare the expected reserve time of FF and nuclear feedstocks (a few hundred years) to that of the sun (about 5 billion years). Next, consider the pollution loading of FFs & N, and the extra energy need to deal with it properly (further reducing effective efficiency), to that of the solar and wind.I find your arguments simplistic and not very convincing.

They also can\u2019t make up for the days, or weeks without sun, or wind, and they can do nothing to fix the seasonal variations.

They are also able to use electricity to generate and store that chemical energy. Regardless of your viewpoint, they are an important and fast-growing part of renewable energy stabilization.Sure, I\u2019ve considered the heating caused by solar panels. They have about the same albedo as the oceans, but they convert solar energy to electricity with about 25% efficiency, the rest is turned to heat, but it is solar energy that would have been absorbed by the earth anyway. Might as well use some of that solar energy to do some work on its way to turning into heat.In contrast, fossil fuels convert chemical energy to heat and use that heat to generate electricity. FF -> E efficiencies are only slightly better than solar panels, but the efficiency losses are EXCESS heat beyond what the sun provides. It also takes millions of years to replenish FFs through the long carbon cycle \u2013 they are not renewable on useful timescales. The same applies to nuclear energy, fission or fusion.

They are also able to use electricity to generate and store that chemical energy. Regardless of your viewpoint, they are an important and fast-growing part of renewable energy stabilization.Sure, I\u2019ve considered the heating caused by solar panels. They have about the same albedo as the oceans, but they convert solar energy to electricity with about 25% efficiency, the rest is turned to heat, but it is solar energy that would have been absorbed by the earth anyway. Might as well use some of that solar energy to do some work on its way to turning into heat.In contrast, fossil fuels convert chemical energy to heat and use that heat to generate electricity. FF -> E efficiencies are only slightly better than solar panels, but the efficiency losses are EXCESS heat beyond what the sun provides. It also takes millions of years to replenish FFs through the long carbon cycle \u2013 they are not renewable on useful timescales. The same applies to nuclear energy, fission or fusion. Their (and FFs) unused heat (~65%) adds to the earth\u2019s heat content above and beyond what the sun does. Maybe Robert should consider the subject a little more deeply.Loading...

Turn on your phone \u2013 you will see a battery generating electical energy from chemically stored energy. A gas or coal power plant also converts chemical energy into electrical energy. Nonetheless, my original comment was about the energy mix of the future, and EIA shows the growth of solar (58%), batteries (23%), and wind (13%) are all much faster than FFs (4%) and nuclear (2%).Also, you failed to comment on the fact that FFs and nuclear ADD to the earth\u2019s direct heat loading, which solar panels (and wind) do not, even though that was your original silly complaint about solar panels. Might also compare the expected reserve time of FF and nuclear feedstocks (a few hundred years) to that of the sun (about 5 billion years). Next, consider the pollution loading of FFs & N, and the extra energy need to deal with it properly (further reducing effective efficiency), to that of the solar and wind.I find your arguments simplistic and not very convincing. Have a good day, hope you entertain yourself finding some more nits to pick.Loading...

It also provides a lot of electricity on a small footprint.

Free markets lift economic activity for everyone. But then we have a belligerent country named China with about 6 times our population. Should we engage in free trade with China? I say no, because it gives them money to pour into their military. Not so good for us.I am for light regulation. But should the government subsidize industries. I say no, generally not. Just to be clear, a government subsidy is when the government gives you other peoples money to do something. A tax break is when you get to keep the money you earned, your own money. A big difference.Oil is a mining business. They get the same tax breaks given other miners. No subsidy here.Nuclear provides steady, 24/7 electricity. This is a very valuable property of nuclear. It also provides a lot of electricity on a small footprint. Given the fact that reliable electricity benefits us all, I am OK with some subsidies here.You are playing a flavor the gotcha game where you want to make me appear to violate my own principles.

Yes battery storage can overcome that shortage \u2013 except there is no surplus generation to recharge the battery during the winter.\u201d Yes, thanks, I am aware of these generalizations, but it really depends on where you are, and what other resources are on the same grid. And, it doesn\u2019t change the fact that both solar and wind still contribute to grid capacity at competitive prices. As far as economics: The people that have the money to invest seem to believe that currently solar is the way to go, providing 58% of new US electricity generation in 2024.

You are not going to change that, no matter how much you deflect and demonstrate your ignorance.Meanwhile, those solar arrays (that won\u2019t work to solve all our energy problems) are out there pumping gigawatts into the grid, and every GWh delivered is a GWh that does not need to burn non-renewable, polluting resources, and saves them for other or later use.Loading...Joe K|October 21, 2024 at 1:59 pm|BAB \u2018s comment \u2013 \u201cSorry that you don\u2019t know the meaning of \u201ccapacity,\u201d but you can look it up.

EIA happened to use rated capacity \u2013 if you don\u2019t like it, too bad \u2013 complain to EIA. The fact remains, solar arrays are the fastest growing form of electricity generation.

The claim that rainfall from Hurricane Florence was boosted 50% by climate change should have raised immediate doubts because observations have not shown an increase in rainfall related to landfalling hurricanes. Any event attribution study that cannot accurately replicate historical trends using the same model and methods is clearly fatally flawed. A comparison of observations and modeled climate history with respect to the extreme weather phenomena under study should always be included in event attribution results.Rule Number Two: All event attribution studies should be preregistered, which means \u201ccommitting to analytic steps without advance knowledge of the research outcomes.\u201d All methodological choices should be made transparent in advance of any event attribution study and submitted to an independent registry (there are many examples). All analyses should be subsequently published, including null- and non-findings. Such preregistration can improve the rigor of research. As one event attribution study concluded: \u201cany event attribution statement can\u2014and will\u2014critically depend on the researcher\u2019s decision regarding the framing of the attribution analysis, in particular with respect to the choice of model, counterfactual climate, and boundary conditions.\u201d Preregistration will make such choices transparent. Any event attribution study conducted in the absence of preregistration is of questionable value.Rule Number Three: All event attribution studies should integrate their findings with the traditional approach to detection and attribution of the IPCC. Event attribution studies often result is what is called \u201cattribution without detection.\u201d This means linking a specific extreme event with climate change in the absence of detecting any increase in the relevant characteristics of such events \u2013 as with attributing Hurricane Florence rainfall (or some fraction of it) to climate change, but without detecting a corresponding long-term increase in rainfall in the climatological record of U.S. hurricanes. Event attribution and the conventional IPCC approach can be integrated by calculating the emergence timescale of trends in the characteristics of the extreme weather event in question, using the same model and methods of the event attribution study. For instance, any event attribution study of a single hurricane\u2019s rainfall should always be accompanied by a quantitative estimate of when changes over time across all hurricanes should be detectable under the conventional IPCC framework.

I had a good bit of education 60 years ago about human behavior when much of this insanity was considered a mental disorder. But that is irrelevant to my knowledge gained since then as a parent and grandparent. There is a parallel between the need to use common sense in evaluating the catastrophic claims of AGW and what is best in the long run for the well being of a child. Adults serve a purpose in a society. They provide guidance and parameters for those who are not in a position to know when their options are being mediated.

Some might believe they would like to be Captain Hook and have a leg amputated. Let them mature beyond adolescence, which by the way for some doesn\u2019t occur until the early 20s, before we start allowing them to make irreversible decisions about their well being.For some whack jobs, I\u2019m sure they see nothing wrong with 12 year old girls deciding to get married.

So, there are less EM energy conserved as heat.\u2013https://www.cristos-vournas.com Christos Vournas|October 29, 2024 at 1:37 pm|Thank you, B A.\u201cNobody is trying to make CO2 go away \u2013 they are trying to slow and stabilize its growth.\u201d\u2013You mean to slow and stop its growth\u2026What about slowing and stabilizing (stoping) the industrial growth?Slowing and stabilizing the world\u2019s population?\u2013https://www.cristos-vournas.comLoading...

If your power source requires boiling water to spin a turbine you need to factor in droughts and the limits to the Carnot cycle (the French had to curtail their nuclear fleet last year). \u201cFrance\u2019s nuclear power stations to limit energy output due to high river temperatures\u201dhttps://www.euronews.com/green/2023/07/13/frances-nuclear-power-stations-to-limit-energy-output-due-to-high-river-temperatures The lack of manageability of wind and solar due to its sporadic nature has been brought up on this blog time after time, only to be met with derision by the alarmists. But now, the chickens has come to roost in Germany due to its headlong plunge over the cliff of \u201cgreen energy\u201d. The country\u2019s rapid solar expansion has led to wholesale power prices frequently turning negative during hours when supply exceeds demand \u2014 for instance on particularly sunny days. Since the government ensures producers get paid a minimum feed-in tariff, it has had to shell out the difference, with renewable subsidies estimated in May to hit \u20ac20 billion ($21.6 billion) this year, and possibly total \u20ac18 billion in 2025. Policymakers therefore want to lower the threshold for solar producers who must sell their output via direct marketing, according to a draft law from the economy ministry obtained by Bloomberg, which involves selling on the electricity exchange. That means producers above a certain capacity level wouldn\u2019t receive remuneration fixed by the state. jim2|October 28, 2024 at 11:14 am|Source:https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-10-28/germany-to-cut-some-solar-farms-off-subsidies-amid-oversupplyLoading...

As an outsider, those who present arguments against AGW seem to have better arguments, and far more integrity. And that brings us to Judith, who exhibits integrity every time she speaks, and in anything she\u2019s written. Perhaps what shows it best, is that she changed her views.

The opinion of many scientists outside that community is different.However, voicing a different opinion of Curry (hell, voicing a different opinion on any aspect of the climate conversation) is likely to result in excommunication, I\u2019m not surprised that you think opinion is unanimous. You might ask Lindgren, Spencer, Pielke (fils and pere), Christy and many more\u2013or you might if you hadn\u2019t already excommunicated them.Remember that in repeated surveys of published climate scientists, although they are unanimous in identifying the greenhouse gas effect, only 66% say that half or more of the current warming is due to our emissions.You may want to paint a picture of unanimity. Not just about Curry\u2013she\u2019s only a symbol. But that unanimity does not exist. Not about Curry. Not about many aspects of the climate conversation.Loading...cerescokid|October 31, 2024 at 5:37 am|JWhat is sad is how so many have been taken in by so few when there is such a wealth of literature that could explain the actual increase in temperatures.

They both were the subject of animated discussion at the time of publication.Bray, von Storch et al, 2010 and Verheggen et al 2014 both found that about two-thirds of published climate scientists attributed half or more of the current warming to anthropogenic causes including greenhouse gas emissions.https://www.rescuethatfrog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Bray-2010.pdfhttps://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/es501998eCertainly a consensus\u2013of sorts\u2013exists, but scientific opinion is heterogeneous enough that acknowledging the gray area vitiates some of the more virulent commentary by consensus supporters. Such as saying that Judith Curry has \u2018blown her credibility\u2019 when it would appear that more than a third of published climate scientists might well find her credible.Which also I guess is why the exercise hasn\u2019t been repeated since.But don\u2019t let facts get in the way of a good story, right?

And do you really think it\u2019s feasible that after these first for years of the decade, the \u201chiatus\u201d is going to \u201ccontinue?\u201dMy take now, as it was back in the day when Judith wrote post after post about a \u201cpause in global warming\u201d is that there was no such thing. What there was, was a short-term decline in the longer-term trend of increased temperatures. That\u2019s what we know. Calling it a \u201chiatus\u201d would imply that there\u2019s a understanding of a mechanism of causality. How has that worked out? Well, I welcome Judith to step forward to explain what the many subsequent years tell her about a mechanism of causality. But what bugged me even more was that a scientist, she conflated \u201cglobal warming\u201d with SATs \u2013 which ignores the primary domain of heat content.2) If you\u2019re saying we should hold feet to the fire for predictions, many on here can provide a list from the past 50 years of failed warmist predictions.Lol.

Are you ok?\u2026including the efficacy of the vaccine in preventing infection,The efficacy of the vaxes in \u201cpreventing infection\u201d were over-stated, just as are the claims that that don\u2019t prevent infection.Early on, they were very effective at preventing infection as well as in preventing transmission. After the early variants, they were certainly less effective at both with the more immunity-invasive variants. I will heartily acknowledge that \u201cexperts\u201d should have expected and communicated exactly that: first, it should have been communicated that an intramuscular shot would have limited efficacy in preventing infection of a respiratory virus spread through mucosal tissue and second, it should have been anticipated that more immune-invasive variants would evolved.There is absolutely NOTHING that I have posted here about the efficacy of masks, government mandates, wet market origin etc. that needs to be corrected. If you want to show something were you think that\u2019s not the case, please do provide an example and we can discuss. I\u2019ve always discussed the uncertainty ranges on all those issues and I think I pegged the uncertainties in ways that are pretty damn consistent with the subsequent evidence that has come to light. Again, please do show me were you think I was in error. I suspect, actually, you have nothing on offer, and instead are just engaging in cheap guilt by association with something or other.Of course, NONE of that has anything at all do to with whether or not Judith is going to speak the credibility of her statements.

Even more is making projections of less than 30-year times spans based largely on even less than 30-year time spans.But that\u2019s what Judith did (obviously she\u2019s an expert and I\u2019m not), so here we have it.

As an outsider, those who present arguments against AGW seem to have better arguments, and far more integrity. And that brings us to Judith, who exhibits integrity every time she speaks, and in anything she\u2019s written. Perhaps what shows it best, is that she changed her views.

The opinion of many scientists outside that community is different.However, voicing a different opinion of Curry (hell, voicing a different opinion on any aspect of the climate conversation) is likely to result in excommunication, I\u2019m not surprised that you think opinion is unanimous. You might ask Lindgren, Spencer, Pielke (fils and pere), Christy and many more\u2013or you might if you hadn\u2019t already excommunicated them.Remember that in repeated surveys of published climate scientists, although they are unanimous in identifying the greenhouse gas effect, only 66% say that half or more of the current warming is due to our emissions.You may want to paint a picture of unanimity. Not just about Curry\u2013she\u2019s only a symbol. But that unanimity does not exist. Not about Curry. Not about many aspects of the climate conversation.Loading...cerescokid|October 31, 2024 at 5:37 am|JWhat is sad is how so many have been taken in by so few when there is such a wealth of literature that could explain the actual increase in temperatures.

They both were the subject of animated discussion at the time of publication.Bray, von Storch et al, 2010 and Verheggen et al 2014 both found that about two-thirds of published climate scientists attributed half or more of the current warming to anthropogenic causes including greenhouse gas emissions.https://www.rescuethatfrog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Bray-2010.pdfhttps://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/es501998eCertainly a consensus\u2013of sorts\u2013exists, but scientific opinion is heterogeneous enough that acknowledging the gray area vitiates some of the more virulent commentary by consensus supporters. Such as saying that Judith Curry has \u2018blown her credibility\u2019 when it would appear that more than a third of published climate scientists might well find her credible.Which also I guess is why the exercise hasn\u2019t been repeated since.But don\u2019t let facts get in the way of a good story, right? We\u2019ve all seen you and your partners in crime do the same trashing of other scientists, so we know what you\u2019re trying to do with Curry.Loading...

And do you really think it\u2019s feasible that after these first for years of the decade, the \u201chiatus\u201d is going to \u201ccontinue?\u201dMy take now, as it was back in the day when Judith wrote post after post about a \u201cpause in global warming\u201d is that there was no such thing. What there was, was a short-term decline in the longer-term trend of increased temperatures. That\u2019s what we know. Calling it a \u201chiatus\u201d would imply that there\u2019s a understanding of a mechanism of causality. How has that worked out? Well, I welcome Judith to step forward to explain what the many subsequent years tell her about a mechanism of causality. But what bugged me even more was that a scientist, she conflated \u201cglobal warming\u201d with SATs \u2013 which ignores the primary domain of heat content.2) If you\u2019re saying we should hold feet to the fire for predictions, many on here can provide a list from the past 50 years of failed warmist predictions.Lol.

I\u2019d be happy to offer proof that I have NEVER been a \u201cmember of the pharma community\u201d \u2013 except proving a negative isn\u2019t possible.What has happened to while I wasn\u2019t watching, bro? I don\u2019t ever remember you beeing this batty. Are you ok?\u2026including the efficacy of the vaccine in preventing infection,The efficacy of the vaxes in \u201cpreventing infection\u201d were over-stated, just as are the claims that that don\u2019t prevent infection.Early on, they were very effective at preventing infection as well as in preventing transmission. After the early variants, they were certainly less effective at both with the more immunity-invasive variants. I will heartily acknowledge that \u201cexperts\u201d should have expected and communicated exactly that: first, it should have been communicated that an intramuscular shot would have limited efficacy in preventing infection of a respiratory virus spread through mucosal tissue and second, it should have been anticipated that more immune-invasive variants would evolved.There is absolutely NOTHING that I have posted here about the efficacy of masks, government mandates, wet market origin etc. that needs to be corrected. If you want to show something were you think that\u2019s not the case, please do provide an example and we can discuss. I\u2019ve always discussed the uncertainty ranges on all those issues and I think I pegged the uncertainties in ways that are pretty damn consistent with the subsequent evidence that has come to light. Again, please do show me were you think I was in error. I suspect, actually, you have nothing on offer, and instead are just engaging in cheap guilt by association with something or other.Of course, NONE of that has anything at all do to with whether or not Judith is going to speak the credibility of her statements.

The opinion of many scientists outside that community is different.However, voicing a different opinion of Curry (hell, voicing a different opinion on any aspect of the climate conversation) is likely to result in excommunication, I\u2019m not surprised that you think opinion is unanimous. You might ask Lindgren, Spencer, Pielke (fils and pere), Christy and many more\u2013or you might if you hadn\u2019t already excommunicated them.Remember that in repeated surveys of published climate scientists, although they are unanimous in identifying the greenhouse gas effect, only 66% say that half or more of the current warming is due to our emissions.You may want to paint a picture of unanimity. Not just about Curry\u2013she\u2019s only a symbol. But that unanimity does not exist. Not about Curry. Not about many aspects of the climate conversation.Loading...cerescokid|October 31, 2024 at 5:37 am|JWhat is sad is how so many have been taken in by so few when there is such a wealth of literature that could explain the actual increase in temperatures.

They both were the subject of animated discussion at the time of publication.Bray, von Storch et al, 2010 and Verheggen et al 2014 both found that about two-thirds of published climate scientists attributed half or more of the current warming to anthropogenic causes including greenhouse gas emissions.https://www.rescuethatfrog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Bray-2010.pdfhttps://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/es501998eCertainly a consensus\u2013of sorts\u2013exists, but scientific opinion is heterogeneous enough that acknowledging the gray area vitiates some of the more virulent commentary by consensus supporters. Such as saying that Judith Curry has \u2018blown her credibility\u2019 when it would appear that more than a third of published climate scientists might well find her credible.Which also I guess is why the exercise hasn\u2019t been repeated since.But don\u2019t let facts get in the way of a good story, right? We\u2019ve all seen you and your partners in crime do the same trashing of other scientists, so we know what you\u2019re trying to do with Curry.Loading...

Thomas W Fuller|October 31, 2024 at 3:38 am|Mr. Bushaw, I have no doubt that the relatively closed and incestuous community of very vocal climate scientists have a bad opinion of Judith Curry. The opinion of many scientists outside that community is different.However, voicing a different opinion of Curry (hell, voicing a different opinion on any aspect of the climate conversation) is likely to result in excommunication, I\u2019m not surprised that you think opinion is unanimous.

Bray, von Storch et al, 2010 and Verheggen et al 2014 both found that about two-thirds of published climate scientists attributed half or more of the current warming to anthropogenic causes including greenhouse gas emissions. https://www.rescuethatfrog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Bray-2010.pdf https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/es501998e Certainly a consensus\u2013of sorts\u2013exists, but scientific opinion is heterogeneous enough that acknowledging the gray area vitiates some of the more virulent commentary by consensus supporters. Such as saying that Judith Curry has \u2018blown her credibility\u2019 when it would appear that more than a third of published climate scientists might well find her credible. Which also I guess is why the exercise hasn\u2019t been repeated since. But don\u2019t let facts get in the way of a good story, right? We\u2019ve all seen you and your partners in crime do the same trashing of other scientists, so we know what you\u2019re trying to do with Curry. jim2|October 30, 2024 at 2:54 pm|Provide direct quotes from original sources, Joshua L Brooks.

And do you really think it\u2019s feasible that after these first for years of the decade, the \u201chiatus\u201d is going to \u201ccontinue?\u201dMy take now, as it was back in the day when Judith wrote post after post about a \u201cpause in global warming\u201d is that there was no such thing. What there was, was a short-term decline in the longer-term trend of increased temperatures. That\u2019s what we know. Calling it a \u201chiatus\u201d would imply that there\u2019s a understanding of a mechanism of causality. How has that worked out? Well, I welcome Judith to step forward to explain what the many subsequent years tell her about a mechanism of causality. But what bugged me even more was that a scientist, she conflated \u201cglobal warming\u201d with SATs \u2013 which ignores the primary domain of heat content.2) If you\u2019re saying we should hold feet to the fire for predictions, many on here can provide a list from the past 50 years of failed warmist predictions.Lol. So now asking for accountability for scientific statements equals \u201cholding feet to the fire.\u201d Jeez. What a bunch of snowflakes.3) As a member of the pharma industry,This is positively beautiful. A member of the pharma industry?Positively abso-frickin-lutely hilarious. Let\u2019s make a bet. I will pay you $10k if you can provide ANY confirmable proof that I\u2019ve EVER been a \u201cmember of the pharma conmmunity\u201d and you\u2019ll pay me $10k if you can\u2019t. Deal? I\u2019d be happy to offer proof that I have NEVER been a \u201cmember of the pharma community\u201d \u2013 except proving a negative isn\u2019t possible.What has happened to while I wasn\u2019t watching, bro? I don\u2019t ever remember you beeing this batty. Are you ok?\u2026including the efficacy of the vaccine in preventing infection,The efficacy of the vaxes in \u201cpreventing infection\u201d were over-stated, just as are the claims that that don\u2019t prevent infection.Early on, they were very effective at preventing infection as well as in preventing transmission. After the early variants, they were certainly less effective at both with the more immunity-invasive variants. I will heartily acknowledge that \u201cexperts\u201d should have expected and communicated exactly that: first, it should have been communicated that an intramuscular shot would have limited efficacy in preventing infection of a respiratory virus spread through mucosal tissue and second, it should have been anticipated that more immune-invasive variants would evolved.There is absolutely NOTHING that I have posted here about the efficacy of masks, government mandates, wet market origin etc. that needs to be corrected. If you want to show something were you think that\u2019s not the case, please do provide an example and we can discuss. I\u2019ve always discussed the uncertainty ranges on all those issues and I think I pegged the uncertainties in ways that are pretty damn consistent with the subsequent evidence that has come to light. Again, please do show me were you think I was in error. I suspect, actually, you have nothing on offer, and instead are just engaging in cheap guilt by association with something or other.Of course, NONE of that has anything at all do to with whether or not Judith is going to speak the credibility of her statements. Of course scientists make errors. That\u2019s a given. What matters is accountability.4) Credibility and integrity usually implies full disclosure.

I always got the sense you were in the \u2018health industry\u2019, but it would have been informative to know \u2026 where your bread is buttered.I have to say, this is truly an example of just a bizarrely facile epistemic on your part. So first, you wrongly interpreted some putative feature of what I\u2019ve said based on an absolutely incorrect epistemic and now, amazingly, you\u2019ve gone from that wrong epistemic to convincing yourself that it was right, even though it was absolutely wrong.Again, my recollection was that you were more careful in your reasoning. Now I could have been wrong then, or perhaps this is just a one off.

Even more is making projections of less than 30-year times spans based largely on even less than 30-year time spans.But that\u2019s what Judith did (obviously she\u2019s an expert and I\u2019m not), so here we have it.

We have written the theoretically exact the planet mean surface temperature equation as a very much reliable theoretical formula:Tmean = [ \u03a6 (1-a) S (\u03b2*N*cp)\u00b9\u2215 \u2074 /4\u03c3 ]\u00b9\u2215 \u2074 (K) (3)The theoretically calculated planets temperatures (Tmean) are almost identical with the measured by satellites (Tsat.mean).2). We shall now compare the theoretically calculated Earth\u2019s (without-atmosphere) the average surface temperature (Tmean) with the satellite measured one, the (Tsat), because we are very much interested to estimate the magnitude of the atmospheric greenhouse effect.Planet\u2026\u2026\u2026Te\u2026\u2026Te.correct\u2026.Tmean\u2026.Tsat.meanMercury\u2026.440 K\u2026\u2026364 K\u2026\u2026..325,83 K\u2026..340 KEarth\u2026\u2026\u2026255 K\u2026\u2026210 K\u2026\u2026..287,74 K\u2026..288 KMoon\u2026\u2026..270,4 K\u2026.224 K\u2026\u2026..223,35 \u039a\u2026..220 \u039aMars\u2026\u2026\u2026.210 K\u2026\u2026174 K\u2026\u2026..213,11 K\u2026..210 KThe planet mean surface temperature New equation is written for planets and moons WITHOUT atmosphere.When applied to Earth (Without Atmosphere) the New equation calculates Earth\u2019s mean surface temperature as 287,74K, which is very much close to the satellite measured 288K.3).

I would answer A. I\u2019m sure most skeptics on this thread would answer A. There is little variation in the sample. The paper analyses the very minor differences in responses from scientists with different quantities of publications, but it tells us little.It does not answer important questions such as, speed of warming, atmospheric sensitivity, constituent components of warming influences and on and on and on.Nonetheless, 91% of published climate scientists think human activity is causing most warming. This is indeed higher than the 66% a decade earlier. The composition of the scientists selected may have been a factor\u2013they were all \u2018geoscientists.\u2019 Previous surveys sampled a wider selection of climate scientists. This paper does not address this.Why is there still a controversy about global warming then? Because answer A to this question does not help us understand very much about climate, climate science, the current warming or anthropogenic contributions to it.This, as is always\u2013always\u2013the case with a John Cook comic book production, a hand-waving exercise. He did the same thing in 2013 and in 2016 and has indulged in it frequently at his misnamed weblog \u2018Skeptical Science.\u2019You should keep up with the cast of characters, BA. There is more to relevance than recency of publication.Loading...B A Bushaw|November 1, 2024 at 2:14 pm|You shouldn\u2019t tell people what they should do. You don\u2019t know me and I don\u2019t know you, and I don\u2019t find anything that looks like you on ResearchGate, unless you wrote a book on the mathematics of classical and quantum physics in the 1960s, and thus, I know nothing of your competences. And apparently you haven\u2019t bothered to check mine. However, your tone says a lot. Must be the frustration of having to admit you are wrong, or living in the past.The relevance is that climate scientists overwhelming believe that humans activities are responsible for more than half of current global warming. I have hope, since you were able to admit this, instead of sticking with your unreferenced (thanks for fixing that) 14 year-old value of 66%.I don\u2019t write the titles of the papers I reference, I read the contents.As for the participants here, you might give your little quiz (I am obviously an A) to Jim2, the Joes, Christos, Burl, and others that claim solar variation causes it all (it is mostly the change in solar capture (GHGs) and reduced albedo (less reflective loss from reduced sea and land ice/snow \u2013 not the very small solar intensity variation.Loading...burlhenry|November 1, 2024 at 3:31 pm|BA:Since you mentioned my name, I would refer you to your post of Dec. 3, 2023, where you stated \u201cSome of the most convincing DATA that supports CO2-GHG-AGW, is the remarkable correlation between temperatures and CO2 rise since 1950, without any other viable and tested explanation (yours is neither) for the temperature rise\u201d.Here is a viable and tested explanation for you to chew upon:\u201cScientific proof that CO2 does NOT cause global warming\u201dhttps://wjarr.com/sites/default/files/WJARR-2024-0884.pdfLoading...jim2|November 1, 2024 at 2:55 pm|Mr. B. just can\u2019t get it right.

Standard survey practice calls for a follow-up to a general question that interrogates ranges, e.g., \u2018What percentage of current warming do you attribute to anthropogenic influence? 10-20%? 21-30%? etc.It is also less than best practice to leave \u2018anthropogenic influence\u2019 untouched. A similar follow-up question would ask for percentages attributable to LU/LC, Milankovitch or other orbital causes, etc., as well as greenhouse gases. Of course then you also have to ask about atmospheric sensitivity to a doubling of concentrations of CO2, which is another can of worms.You can of course leave out those questions, citing concerns over length of survey, etc. But then you leave your results fearfully open to question.Which you would know, Mr. Bushaw, if you knew anything about best practices in opinion surveys.

Standard survey practice calls for a follow-up to a general question that interrogates ranges, e.g., \u2018What percentage of current warming do you attribute to anthropogenic influence? 10-20%? 21-30%? etc.It is also less than best practice to leave \u2018anthropogenic influence\u2019 untouched. A similar follow-up question would ask for percentages attributable to LU/LC, Milankovitch or other orbital causes, etc., as well as greenhouse gases. Of course then you also have to ask about atmospheric sensitivity to a doubling of concentrations of CO2, which is another can of worms.You can of course leave out those questions, citing concerns over length of survey, etc. But then you leave your results fearfully open to question.Which you would know, Mr. Bushaw, if you knew anything about best practices in opinion surveys.

Standard survey practice calls for a follow-up to a general question that interrogates ranges, e.g., \u2018What percentage of current warming do you attribute to anthropogenic influence? 10-20%? 21-30%? etc. It is also less than best practice to leave \u2018anthropogenic influence\u2019 untouched. A similar follow-up question would ask for percentages attributable to LU/LC, Milankovitch or other orbital causes, etc., as well as greenhouse gases. Of course then you also have to ask about atmospheric sensitivity to a doubling of concentrations of CO2, which is another can of worms. You can of course leave out those questions, citing concerns over length of survey, etc. But then you leave your results fearfully open to question. Which you would know, Mr. Bushaw, if you knew anything about best practices in opinion surveys. So much easier to make fun of those you disagree with, don\u2019t you think?

But that for letting us know your background, Mr. survey taker. Thomas Fuller, You can be surprised all you want \u2013 you have no idea of what I am aware of. But thanks for giving your references (after the fact). They are 10 and 14 years old, and I am familiar with them. (you may unsurprise yourself) I\u2019m more interested in what working (publishing) climate scientists think in the current decade. That is what I referenced. I\u2019m sorry if you haven\u2019t read or understood it. They have seven different levels of concurrence and disagreement with AGW theory, and break those down by specific areas in the AGW theory. If you don\u2019t like that one, you can try to understand this one: \u201cConsensus revisited: quantifying scientific agreement on climate change and climate expertise among Earth scientists 10 years later\u201d, Krista F Myers et al 2021 Environ. Res. Lett. 16 104030https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ac2774 \u201cWe find that agreement on anthropogenic global warming is high (91% to 100%) and generally increases with expertise. Out of a group of 153 independently confirmed climate experts, 98.7% of those scientists indicated that the Earth is getting warmer mostly because of human activity such as burning fossil fuels. Among those with the highest level of expertise (independently confirmed climate experts who each published 20+ peer reviewed papers on climate change between 2015 and 2019) there was 100% agreement that the Earth is warming mostly because of human activity.\u201d Note the use of \u201cmostly\u201d that means more than half.

The paper analyses the very minor differences in responses from scientists with different quantities of publications, but it tells us little.It does not answer important questions such as, speed of warming, atmospheric sensitivity, constituent components of warming influences and on and on and on.Nonetheless, 91% of published climate scientists think human activity is causing most warming.

Thomas W Fuller|November 3, 2024 at 9:45 am|The problem with this survey, as with others of this type, is that when they say \u2018half or more of current warming,\u2019 we are left to guess whether that means 51% or 99% or something in between. Standard survey practice calls for a follow-up to a general question that interrogates ranges, e.g., \u2018What percentage of current warming do you attribute to anthropogenic influence? 10-20%? 21-30%? etc.It is also less than best practice to leave \u2018anthropogenic influence\u2019 untouched. A similar follow-up question would ask for percentages attributable to LU/LC, Milankovitch or other orbital causes, etc., as well as greenhouse gases. Of course then you also have to ask about atmospheric sensitivity to a doubling of concentrations of CO2, which is another can of worms.You can of course leave out those questions, citing concerns over length of survey, etc. But then you leave your results fearfully open to question.Which you would know, Mr. Bushaw, if you knew anything about best practices in opinion surveys.

The problem with this survey, as with others of this type, is that when they say \u2018half or more of current warming,\u2019 we are left to guess whether that means 51% or 99% or something in between. Standard survey practice calls for a follow-up to a general question that interrogates ranges, e.g., \u2018What percentage of current warming do you attribute to anthropogenic influence? 10-20%? 21-30%? etc. It is also less than best practice to leave \u2018anthropogenic influence\u2019 untouched. A similar follow-up question would ask for percentages attributable to LU/LC, Milankovitch or other orbital causes, etc., as well as greenhouse gases. Of course then you also have to ask about atmospheric sensitivity to a doubling of concentrations of CO2, which is another can of worms. You can of course leave out those questions, citing concerns over length of survey, etc. But then you leave your results fearfully open to question. Which you would know, Mr. Bushaw, if you knew anything about best practices in opinion surveys. So much easier to make fun of those you disagree with, don\u2019t you think?

No, Greenhouse gasses were first blamed for global warming in June 1988 when James Hansen made his presentation to Congress, where he said that temperatures then were higher then than at any other time in the instrumental record. He ascribed it (without any proof) to the Greenhouse effect.This seemed plausible because temperatures were rising at about the same rate as CO2 levels were rising at the Mauna Loa observatory (although as you know, correlation is not necessarily causation). However, after his presentation, warming due to Greenhouse gasses became widely acceptedBecause of Acid Rain and health concerns \u201cClean Air\u201d legislation was passed in the 1970\u2019s in the US and Europe to reduce the amount of industrial SO2 aerosol pollution the troposphere.In the run-up to 1980, those aerosols peaked at 141 million tons, in 1979, and as the result of the Clean Air, and later, Net Zero efforts, they began falling circa 1980, and by 2022 they had fallen to 73 million tons, a decrease of 68 million tons.Decreasing pollution in the atmosphere increases the intensity of the solar radiation striking the Earth\u2019s surface, and warming naturally occurs. This warming is indisputable, but it is ignored, and is instead blamed on CO2.So, ALL SO2, no CO2!Thus, there is NO SO2 aerosol \u201cun-cooling\u201d contribution, as you falsely maintain.Loading...

Ireneusz Palmowski|November 1, 2024 at 12:09 pm|The most important question now is why the production of ozone in the upper stratosphere in the tropics is declining, as evidenced by the temperature drop on about 5 hPa at an altitude of 35 km.

They are unadjusted raw minimum daily temperatures, Tmin. (A similar study with Tmax gives similar inferences to Tmin.) The graphing program shows them smoothed, but the real variation is much larger than the graph lines show.The 45 weather stations were chosen because they had long records and because they were the closest candidates I could find, after trips around Australia exploring for minerals, to be \u201cPristine\u201d sites for UHI studies. The local influence of humans on these temperatures has been minimal.The stations have derived temperature trends over time with the highest value in being 3.1 deg C per century equivalent and the lowest being -0.15. These are approximate because of coarse treatment of missing data.Some of the records start in year 1910. In that year, it is thought that CO2 emissions were too small to affect temperature. Presumably, there was a later time for CO2 to affect temperature. My query is why that later time is not evident in the patterns of any of there v45 pristine sites? Why are there no visible trend breaks at 1950 or whatever date is believed to apply for the CO2 effect to become visible?The data show no significant correlation of measured atmospheric CO2 and ground temperatures, mathematically or visually from the graphs.How is it justified for neutral scientists like me to claim that CO2 is affecting temperatures? Is a correlation shown by others only possible when confounding factors like UHI are present? If so, that would be dishonest science.Geoff Shttp://www.geoffstuff.com/pristtmin.jpgLoading...

My understanding is that almost all excited CO2 at lower tropospheric pressures is deactivated by collisions, not radiative decay \u2013 as you say, \u201cvia thermalization\u201d where all the gas is heated equally \u2013 water doesn\u2019t take up more than about 4% (high humidity) of the radiant energy absorbed by CO2. \u201cA more valid temperature trend is 0.16 K/decade from UAH data\u201d. What level of the atmosphere was that? I\u2019m pretty sure most evaporation that adds WV to the atmosphere occurs at the surface. REMSS-MSU, uses the same raw data as UAH and has a low troposphere channel that yields 0.227 K/decade. Their middle troposphere channel is in substantial agreement with UAH. https://images.remss.com/msu/msu_time_series.html \u201cDo you accept without challenge what others say in journals?\u201d No, the physical causality has to make sense to my physics background. IMHO, it seems to be a more frequent problem with blogs. \u201cIt appears that no one else has thought to do the common-sense determination of average global residence time.\u201d I don\u2019t know what the \u201ccommon sense\u201d means, but there have been a number of determinations of average H20 molecular atmospheric residence time.

They have NO science, only insults, false accusations, and snark. That\u2019s why they have to make up childish nonsense like \u201cSky Dragons\u201d.Let\u2019s talk science. CO2\u2019s 15\u00b5 photons can NOT raise the temperature of Earth\u2019s 288K surface. The first thing to understand is what \u201ctemperature\u201d is.A bucket of water has a \u201ctemperature\u201d. Humans invented a way to measure that temperature. A simple mercury thermometer is placed in the water. The molecules in the water have kinetic energy \u2014 they are moving. As the molecules strike the glass tube of the thermometer, their energy can transfer to the glass and then to the mercury. If the water is hot, the water molecules cause the mercury molecules to become more active, causing the mercury to expand, causing its level in the tube to rise. We calibrate the tube for whatever temperature scale we prefer \u2014 Celsius, Fahrenheit, Kelvin (Absolute), Rankine, or other.Simple.The temperature of the water becomes the temperature of the mercury. We say the temperature is due to the average kinetic energy of the molecules. If no new thermal energy is added to the water, or lost, the temperature remains constant, and the thermometer reads the same temperature. If a heater raises the water temperature, the thermometer reads higher.If ice is added to the water, its temperature drops. The average kinetic energy of the molecules is reduced, the level of the mercury falls, and the thermometer reads a cooler temperature.It\u2019s important to note here that adding ice adds both mass and energy to the water. Mass does not determine temperature, so we need to only consider the energy. The average kinetic energy of the ice molecules is less than the average kinetic energy of the water molecules, so the average kinetic energy decreases, and the thermometer reads a lower temperature.Energy is added, but the temperature decreases!So, adding energy does NOT always result in a higher temperature. It HAS TO BE the right kind of energy. As applied to climate science, the frequency of absorbed photons would have to raise the average kinetic energy of the water molecules. That\u2019s why we know ice cannot boil water, and CO2\u2019s 15\u00b5 photons can not warm Earth\u2019s 288K surface.It\u2019s simple. Just basic physics.Loading...B A Bushaw|November 6, 2024 at 10:39 am|Jim2,Thanks, Now I understand, Sky Dragons are similar to Flying Pizza Monsters.Loading...B A Bushaw|November 6, 2024 at 11:08 am|R: \u201cCO2\u2019s 15\u00b5 photons can NOT raise the temperature of Earth\u2019s 288K surface.\u201d That is your false hypothesis, for which you provide no evidence. You do not understand the difference between the kinetic energy of vibration of massed particles and lattices vs. massless electromagnetic radiation. You do not understand the difference between heat and temperature.

I\u2019ll make it easy for you: If the earth\u2019s surface (assume 288 K) can emit at 15 microns (it does), it can also absorb there. Bye bye, No more invisible flying pizza monsters today.Loading...Clint R|November 6, 2024 at 7:30 pm|Bushaw, you\u2019re just throwing crap against the wall hoping something will stick. You don\u2019t understand the relevant physics.If something absorbs the same photon as it emits, there is no increase in temperature.

They have NO science, only insults, false accusations, and snark. That\u2019s why they have to make up childish nonsense like \u201cSky Dragons\u201d.Let\u2019s talk science. CO2\u2019s 15\u00b5 photons can NOT raise the temperature of Earth\u2019s 288K surface. The first thing to understand is what \u201ctemperature\u201d is.A bucket of water has a \u201ctemperature\u201d. Humans invented a way to measure that temperature. A simple mercury thermometer is placed in the water. The molecules in the water have kinetic energy \u2014 they are moving. As the molecules strike the glass tube of the thermometer, their energy can transfer to the glass and then to the mercury. If the water is hot, the water molecules cause the mercury molecules to become more active, causing the mercury to expand, causing its level in the tube to rise. We calibrate the tube for whatever temperature scale we prefer \u2014 Celsius, Fahrenheit, Kelvin (Absolute), Rankine, or other.Simple.The temperature of the water becomes the temperature of the mercury. We say the temperature is due to the average kinetic energy of the molecules. If no new thermal energy is added to the water, or lost, the temperature remains constant, and the thermometer reads the same temperature. If a heater raises the water temperature, the thermometer reads higher.If ice is added to the water, its temperature drops. The average kinetic energy of the molecules is reduced, the level of the mercury falls, and the thermometer reads a cooler temperature.It\u2019s important to note here that adding ice adds both mass and energy to the water. Mass does not determine temperature, so we need to only consider the energy. The average kinetic energy of the ice molecules is less than the average kinetic energy of the water molecules, so the average kinetic energy decreases, and the thermometer reads a lower temperature.Energy is added, but the temperature decreases!So, adding energy does NOT always result in a higher temperature. It HAS TO BE the right kind of energy. As applied to climate science, the frequency of absorbed photons would have to raise the average kinetic energy of the water molecules. That\u2019s why we know ice cannot boil water, and CO2\u2019s 15\u00b5 photons can not warm Earth\u2019s 288K surface.It\u2019s simple.

They have NO science, only insults, false accusations, and snark. That\u2019s why they have to make up childish nonsense like \u201cSky Dragons\u201d.Let\u2019s talk science. CO2\u2019s 15\u00b5 photons can NOT raise the temperature of Earth\u2019s 288K surface. The first thing to understand is what \u201ctemperature\u201d is.A bucket of water has a \u201ctemperature\u201d. Humans invented a way to measure that temperature. A simple mercury thermometer is placed in the water. The molecules in the water have kinetic energy \u2014 they are moving. As the molecules strike the glass tube of the thermometer, their energy can transfer to the glass and then to the mercury. If the water is hot, the water molecules cause the mercury molecules to become more active, causing the mercury to expand, causing its level in the tube to rise. We calibrate the tube for whatever temperature scale we prefer \u2014 Celsius, Fahrenheit, Kelvin (Absolute), Rankine, or other.Simple.The temperature of the water becomes the temperature of the mercury. We say the temperature is due to the average kinetic energy of the molecules. If no new thermal energy is added to the water, or lost, the temperature remains constant, and the thermometer reads the same temperature. If a heater raises the water temperature, the thermometer reads higher.If ice is added to the water, its temperature drops. The average kinetic energy of the molecules is reduced, the level of the mercury falls, and the thermometer reads a cooler temperature.It\u2019s important to note here that adding ice adds both mass and energy to the water. Mass does not determine temperature, so we need to only consider the energy. The average kinetic energy of the ice molecules is less than the average kinetic energy of the water molecules, so the average kinetic energy decreases, and the thermometer reads a lower temperature.Energy is added, but the temperature decreases!So, adding energy does NOT always result in a higher temperature. It HAS TO BE the right kind of energy. As applied to climate science, the frequency of absorbed photons would have to raise the average kinetic energy of the water molecules. That\u2019s why we know ice cannot boil water, and CO2\u2019s 15\u00b5 photons can not warm Earth\u2019s 288K surface.It\u2019s simple. Just basic physics.Loading...B A Bushaw|November 6, 2024 at 10:39 am|Jim2,Thanks, Now I understand, Sky Dragons are similar to Flying Pizza Monsters.Loading...B A Bushaw|November 6, 2024 at 11:08 am|R: \u201cCO2\u2019s 15\u00b5 photons can NOT raise the temperature of Earth\u2019s 288K surface.\u201d That is your false hypothesis, for which you provide no evidence.

Clint R|November 6, 2024 at 10:38 am|Jim2 leaves his snarky comment, joining in with Cassen and Bushaw. They have NO science, only insults, false accusations, and snark. That\u2019s why they have to make up childish nonsense like \u201cSky Dragons\u201d.Let\u2019s talk science. CO2\u2019s 15\u00b5 photons can NOT raise the temperature of Earth\u2019s 288K surface. The first thing to understand is what \u201ctemperature\u201d is.A bucket of water has a \u201ctemperature\u201d. Humans invented a way to measure that temperature. A simple mercury thermometer is placed in the water. The molecules in the water have kinetic energy \u2014 they are moving. As the molecules strike the glass tube of the thermometer, their energy can transfer to the glass and then to the mercury. If the water is hot, the water molecules cause the mercury molecules to become more active, causing the mercury to expand, causing its level in the tube to rise. We calibrate the tube for whatever temperature scale we prefer \u2014 Celsius, Fahrenheit, Kelvin (Absolute), Rankine, or other.Simple.The temperature of the water becomes the temperature of the mercury. We say the temperature is due to the average kinetic energy of the molecules. If no new thermal energy is added to the water, or lost, the temperature remains constant, and the thermometer reads the same temperature. If a heater raises the water temperature, the thermometer reads higher.If ice is added to the water, its temperature drops. The average kinetic energy of the molecules is reduced, the level of the mercury falls, and the thermometer reads a cooler temperature.It\u2019s important to note here that adding ice adds both mass and energy to the water. Mass does not determine temperature, so we need to only consider the energy. The average kinetic energy of the ice molecules is less than the average kinetic energy of the water molecules, so the average kinetic energy decreases, and the thermometer reads a lower temperature.Energy is added, but the temperature decreases!So, adding energy does NOT always result in a higher temperature. It HAS TO BE the right kind of energy. As applied to climate science, the frequency of absorbed photons would have to raise the average kinetic energy of the water molecules. That\u2019s why we know ice cannot boil water, and CO2\u2019s 15\u00b5 photons can not warm Earth\u2019s 288K surface.It\u2019s simple. Just basic physics.Loading...

They have NO science, only insults, false accusations, and snark. That\u2019s why they have to make up childish nonsense like \u201cSky Dragons\u201d.Let\u2019s talk science. CO2\u2019s 15\u00b5 photons can NOT raise the temperature of Earth\u2019s 288K surface. The first thing to understand is what \u201ctemperature\u201d is.A bucket of water has a \u201ctemperature\u201d. Humans invented a way to measure that temperature. A simple mercury thermometer is placed in the water. The molecules in the water have kinetic energy \u2014 they are moving. As the molecules strike the glass tube of the thermometer, their energy can transfer to the glass and then to the mercury. If the water is hot, the water molecules cause the mercury molecules to become more active, causing the mercury to expand, causing its level in the tube to rise. We calibrate the tube for whatever temperature scale we prefer \u2014 Celsius, Fahrenheit, Kelvin (Absolute), Rankine, or other.Simple.The temperature of the water becomes the temperature of the mercury. We say the temperature is due to the average kinetic energy of the molecules. If no new thermal energy is added to the water, or lost, the temperature remains constant, and the thermometer reads the same temperature. If a heater raises the water temperature, the thermometer reads higher.If ice is added to the water, its temperature drops. The average kinetic energy of the molecules is reduced, the level of the mercury falls, and the thermometer reads a cooler temperature.It\u2019s important to note here that adding ice adds both mass and energy to the water. Mass does not determine temperature, so we need to only consider the energy. The average kinetic energy of the ice molecules is less than the average kinetic energy of the water molecules, so the average kinetic energy decreases, and the thermometer reads a lower temperature.Energy is added, but the temperature decreases!So, adding energy does NOT always result in a higher temperature. It HAS TO BE the right kind of energy. As applied to climate science, the frequency of absorbed photons would have to raise the average kinetic energy of the water molecules. That\u2019s why we know ice cannot boil water, and CO2\u2019s 15\u00b5 photons can not warm Earth\u2019s 288K surface.It\u2019s simple. Just basic physics.Loading...

Christos Vournas|November 6, 2024 at 9:18 am|B A, here it is what Dr. Roy Spencer, a real climate scientist, at UAH covered it in a blog in 2016:\u201cYesterday I showed that the difference in rotation rate between the Earth and the Moon caused the more-slowly rotating Moon to be about 55 deg. colder than the Earth, all other things being equal (no atmosphere, the same albedo and IR emissivity, and a surface bulk heat capacity which gives model temperatures than match actual lunar observations). The effect is muted the greater the surface bulk heat capacity, since that also reduces the diurnal temperature range.Basically, any process which increases the day-night temperature range (such as a longer diurnal cycle) will decrease the average temperature of a planet, simply because of the non-linearity of the S-B equation. I suspect the effect does not exist if the surface being heated has zero heat capacity, since the temperature of the surface will instantly come into equilibrium with the absorbed sunlight; in that case the length of day would not matter.

B A, here it is what Dr. Roy Spencer, a real climate scientist, at UAH covered it in a blog in 2016: \u201cYesterday I showed that the difference in rotation rate between the Earth and the Moon caused the more-slowly rotating Moon to be about 55 deg. colder than the Earth, all other things being equal (no atmosphere, the same albedo and IR emissivity, and a surface bulk heat capacity which gives model temperatures than match actual lunar observations). The effect is muted the greater the surface bulk heat capacity, since that also reduces the diurnal temperature range. Basically, any process which increases the day-night temperature range (such as a longer diurnal cycle) will decrease the average temperature of a planet, simply because of the non-linearity of the S-B equation. I suspect the effect does not exist if the surface being heated has zero heat capacity, since the temperature of the surface will instantly come into equilibrium with the absorbed sunlight; in that case the length of day would not matter.

If we use the top seven series listed in table one, that is everything but CO2, and regress against HadCRUT5 we get the result shown in orange in figure 2. If we then regress everything, including CO2, we get the blue dashed line in figure 2. The two lines are nearly identical. Most of you know where that web site is.

One way this manifests itself is by demonizing individualism, associating it with impure cultural character (i.e. racist), while simultaneously advertising approved collectivist thinking as pure. Conservatism in the US is centered on individual freedom\u2013this therefore is racist for the collectivist.Divisive, politically inspired identity politics is really good at consensus building. \u201cIt\u2019s science, therefore it must be right\u201d\u2013Goebbels proved the utility of identity politics\u2013political science.Now we see she\u2019s backpeddling, it\u2019s a professional necessity.Loading...cerescokid|November 7, 2024 at 6:54 pm|ganonYou seem especially sensitive and agitated today.

I posited that he was the ideological preamble for the AGW movement, ultimately leading to consensus climate science:https://judithcurry.com/2024/10/06/the-fatal-flaw-in-artificial-intelligence-climate-change/#comment-1010768Time was limited in my earlier post, but there\u2019s more provenance for the how Flohn\u2019s ecofascist collectivism was the central influence leading to global climate activism.Initially Flohn\u2019s ideas failed in fits and starts to capture attention (there was little science backing global warming, it was merely an unsupported idea), though eventually Flohn\u2019s ideas generated politcal imagination. When leveraged with an international desire for collectivist influence his ideas led to the bureaucratic formation of the IPCC in 1988. Ideology quickly found its cultural influence, strengthened by deep pocketed global government funding under the auspice of finding consensus\u2014politics homoginized with science.

Her overall ambition was to combat anticipated climate change. She organized the first U.N. conference on climate, COP 1 in Berlin in April 1995. Both Merkel and Helmut Kohl spoke in their introductory statements about carbon dioxide as \u201cclimate poison carbon dioxide.\u201d\u2026\u201d The climate issue perfectly suited Merkel, if her aspirations were to change Germany and the world according to ideas developed by Hermann Flohn and Green Socialist ideologists like Bahro, Harich, and Havemann. With her position as a minister in the governing CDU party, she could have much more influence on policy in Germany than as an activist in the Green Party.\u201d\u201cMerkel fully committed herself to negotiating the Treaty of Kyoto to combat global warming.

While common perception promotes the idea of science-based policies and politics, the reality is theexact opposite, i.e., politics-based science.

Here\u2019s another paper from Demetris: Relative importance of carbon dioxide and water in thegreenhouse effect: Does the tail wag the dog? \u201cA notable feature of the current period is that the classical value of science as the pursuit of the truth, independently of other interests, is gradually being abandoned (Koutsoyiannis andMamassis, 2021). People pride themselves on being scientists and activists at the same time (Koutsoyiannis, 2020b), while calls for political actions to \u201csave the planet\u201d, including enhancedglobal governance, are published even in scientific journals (e.g. Biermann et al., 2012). While common perception promotes the idea of science-based policies and politics, the reality is theexact opposite, i.e., politics-based science. For it is self-evident that by mixing science and politics the end product is politics. A relevant example is provided by the high-profile journal Nature,which declares that it is \u201ccommitted to supporting the research enterprise\u201d1, but admits being involved in politics and proclaims that this is the right thing (Howe, 2020; Nature Editorial, 2023), even though it is recognized that this affects scientific credibility and causes loss of confidence in science (Lupia, 2023; Zhang, 2023). Another relevant example is the campaign of a famouslearned society, the American Geophysical Union (AGU), related to the USA 2024 election.2\u201d https://t.co/o8vlUc2NwF https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0309/v1 Jungletrunks|November 9, 2024 at 10:53 am|Thanks for the link, Bill.Demetris nails it, contemporary science has lost its moorings, at least within certain disciplines.Climate science is perhaps the poster child for what happens when politics leads science, what can possibly go wrong?

And thus, any quantitative results you obtain for earth are actually for a mythical planet that does not exist, and you should make that explicitly clear. I love your quantitation \u201c~\u201d. You can find the real composition of the atmosphere in hundreds of places, e.g: https://earthhow.com/earth-atmosphere-composition CO2 is the 4th most abundant non-condensing gas (NCG, not regulated by temperature and phase changes) in the atmosphere. It is the most abundant NCG that is infrared active, and is not classified as trace gas. As you have been told many times(with references), the atmosphere is optically thick for broad absorption by CO2\u2019s IR active bending mode. Creative thought is a wonderful thing; not bothering checking it against existing knowledge is not. Perhaps a little more study of science, instead of dreaming about inventing new hypotheses, that might make you famous, would be in order.

And thus, any quantitative results you obtain for earth are actually for a mythical planet that does not exist, and you should make that explicitly clear.

Everything in the New Equation is double-checked for.\u201d \u201cthin\u201d is not a defined quantity and is incorrect, as has been explained to you. Atmosphere, convective and advective heat fluxes (ocean and atmosphere) are not included in your treatment. So, did you double-check them, or double-check to make sure you left them out? Also for double-checking, I once asked for a units check on your equations \u2013 I\u2019m still waiting. Double-checking includes more that equations, it also should include a detailed check on physical causality.

Did you have to look those up? I\u2019m new here but already know who the biggest abuser is. Bushaw comments much more than anyone else, yet offers NO science. He resorts to nothing but his childish tactics. It\u2019s important for us to remember some definitions of science: \u2013knowledge or a system of knowledge covering general truths or the operation of general laws especially as obtained and tested through scientific method \u2013such knowledge or such a system of knowledge concerned with the physical world and its phenomena \u2013a system or method reconciling practical ends with scientific laws \u2013the state of knowing: knowledge as distinguished from ignorance or misunderstanding Notice words like: Knowledge, Truths, and Laws. Notice also there is no mention of consensus, opinions, or beliefs. Bushaw can\u2019t support his false beliefs because he\u2019s ignorant of the relevant science.

As a forcing it can induce feedbacks that cause more warming, e.g., temperature mediated increase in atmospheric water vapor, or release of CH4 from frozen tundra and decomposition of methane clathrates in deep, cold oceans (yes the extra heat is getting there too).

These in turn warm up the surrounding air within the greenhouse. As the structure is not open to the atmosphere, the warmed air cannot escape via convection due to the presence of roof and walls, so the temperature inside the greenhouse rises.\u201d/i> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse \u201cThe incident solar radiation passes through the transparent roof and walls\u2026\u201d Wagathon|November 10, 2024 at 11:25 am|Use of the analogy of a greenhouse with respect to global warming alarmism is not objective at all.

I disproved your hypothesis with facts (publicly available data) and simple arithmetic. I do not have to disprove your facts, such as they are. Your denial is understandable on psychological grounds, but not on scientific and math grounds.If is quite simple: Your hypothesis, that reduction in SO2 emissions is responsible for ALL current warming and therefore CO2 can\u2019t cause any warming, is unproven and false, for lack of evidence, lack of quantitation, and it has been formally disproved.Again, as said: I urge folks to read Burl\u2019s paper. I\u2019d add, perhaps let Burl know what you think of it. It would be hearing other contrarian\u2019s opinions of Burl\u2019s hypothesis.Loading...burlhenry|November 12, 2024 at 2:14 pm|BA:What nonsense!You are basically saying that decreasing levels of atmospheric S02 aerosol pollution will NOT cause temperatures to rise, but, instead, that all of the current warming is due to rising levels of CO2. in the atmosphere.Historically, all of the prior warming periods, such as the Roman and Medieval warming periods were due to to very few volcanic eruptions, so that their atmospheres were essentially free of dimming SO2 aerosols.Due to on-going \u201cClean Air\u201d and \u201cNet-Zero\u201d efforts, we are decreasing atmospheric SO2 aerosol levels, causing temperatures to rise, as then, and the cleaner the air, the hotter it will get!!Loading...B A Bushaw|November 12, 2024 at 2:40 pm|Burl, I\u2019m not really interested in your repetitious denials, Nonetheless: Your facts and handwaving are not quantitative, and do not address what fraction of warming is caused by decrease in anthropogenic SO2 emissions. \u201cAll\u201d is not believable from the get-go. There are many papers that put it between 10 \u2013 30%. You have not referenced or refuted those (that is either ignorance or dishonesty). Your papers are not science, they are pseudo-scientific opinions that have not been properly researched or referenced, by scientific standards.Funny thing about proofs and disproofs of hypotheses. To prove one, you must account for every possible instance, which is generally not possible in the real universe. However, to disprove a hypothesis, one only needs to demonstrate that a single instance is false. I have done that, and need do no more.Ta TaPS ~ what kind of engineer were you at IBM.Loading...burlhenry|November 13, 2024 at 2:10 pm|About a year ago, I had asked you why you believed that CO2 causes global warming. I can\u2019t find your reply, but as I recall you said that it was because of the coincidence between the rise of CO2 in the atmosphere, and the concurrent rise in temperatures.Is that still your belief, and why?Loading...B A Bushaw|November 12, 2024 at 2:55 pm|Burl, the \u201cnonsense\u201d is yours. I freely admit that reduction in anthropogenic SO2 emissions results in relative warming (as a result of less reflective cooling). What I deny is that it is responsible for all recent warming, as you claim to have proven.Further, based on literature that you do not reference, I claim that A-SO2\u2033 warming is under 1/3 of current total warming, and that is only getting smaller as SO2 concentrations decrease and CO2 increases.Not only is it not possible for your hypothesis to be proven, it has been disproven. Sorry, you don\u2019t understand.Loading...B A Bushaw|November 13, 2024 at 3:21 pm|Burl,There is a reason you can\u2019t find it. I never said it, and it is not my belief.My belief is in the physical causality explanation that has been developed over 200 years of investigations by physical scientists, and not the hypothesis of a retired engineer with unspecified field. I find the correlation of GAST and SSAT with CO2e as supporting evidence for the accepted physical causality.Also I find the lack of temperature correlation for SO2 with temperature (1950-1980 vs 1980-2010) to be dispositive of the hypothesis that A-SO2 can explain all warming.If I failed to answer you previously, I apologize. Now, I just recently asked you what kind of engineer you were, I don\u2019t find \u201cIBM Engineer (ret.)\u201d terribly enlightening.

I find the correlation of GAST and SSAT with CO2e as supporting evidence for the accepted physical causality.Also I find the lack of temperature correlation for SO2 with temperature (1950-1980 vs 1980-2010) to be dispositive of the hypothesis that A-SO2 can explain all warming.If I failed to answer you previously, I apologize.

But, I have already refuted the hypothesis, disproving it simply by looking at \u0394T/\u0394S, where S represents annual anthropogenic SO2 emissions; comparing the rising 30 years before S peaked (1950-1980) and the declining 30 years (1980-2010), which are relatively symmetric. The \u0394T/\u0394S ratio changes sign; I hope you know what that means. I\u2019d be glad to repost the graphical disproof if you can\u2019t find the link I already gave.

I freely admit that reduction in anthropogenic SO2 emissions results in relative warming (as a result of less reflective cooling). What I deny is that it is responsible for all recent warming, as you claim to have proven.Further, based on literature that you do not reference, I claim that A-SO2\u2033 warming is under 1/3 of current total warming, and that is only getting smaller as SO2 concentrations decrease and CO2 increases.Not only is it not possible for your hypothesis to be proven, it has been disproven.

I never said it, and it is not my belief.My belief is in the physical causality explanation that has been developed over 200 years of investigations by physical scientists, and not the hypothesis of a retired engineer with unspecified field. I find the correlation of GAST and SSAT with CO2e as supporting evidence for the accepted physical causality.Also I find the lack of temperature correlation for SO2 with temperature (1950-1980 vs 1980-2010) to be dispositive of the hypothesis that A-SO2 can explain all warming.If I failed to answer you previously, I apologize.

My \u201chypothesis\u201d is that all of our modern warming , since 1980, has been due to decreasing levels of industrial SO2 aerosols in the atmosphere, as is shown your graph., rather than to rising levels of CO2.You are correct when you say that SO2 aerosol levels rose between 1950 and 1980, but NOT correct when you say that temperatures rose during that time.They were -0.227 deg. C. in 1950 and 26 years later, in 1976, they were -0.216 deg. C., an increase of 0.011 deg. C, well within the margin of error.

That would still disprove your hypothesis \u2013 NO EFFECT FROM LARGE INCREASES IN A-SO2 emissions.As for cherry-picking, I picked 1950-1980 because it is symmetric (increasing) with the decreasing period 1980-2010, and decadal A-SO2 was available from OurWorldinData . You, however, cherry-picked 1976 as your end point because it is the lowest teperature value available in the vicinity \u2013 the very definition of cherry-picking. Guess what \u2013 you still are disproven \u2013 see the first paragraph. Secondly, if you treat the temperature data as a climatic trend (31 point symmetric average) it becomes apparent that there was indeed a modest but significant T increase from 1950-1980. disproven again.https://mega.nz/file/RzNVkaoD#WE2NMseirWVZnP7VO_ySLwVRkBp-k-y1QPFDybyHRtILoading...

Due to on-going \u201cClean Air\u201d and \u201cNet-Zero\u201d efforts, we are decreasing atmospheric SO2 aerosol levels, causing temperatures to rise, as then, and the cleaner the air, the hotter it will get!!

The UN expert climate scientists say that shutting coal plants and building windmills is the best way to stop floods.Matt Ridley is wondering if removing 133 dams had anything to do with it, or if perhaps they should have built the big dam that was approved in 2001 but stopped by the Socialists in 2004:Dam shame: what really caused Valencia\u2019s floods?Matt Ridley, The Spectator\u2026 Valencia had a similarly terrible flood in 1957, in which 81 people died, long before climate change became the go-to excuse for any bad weather. After that flood, to prevent a recurrence, the Spanish government built a string of dams in the hills to hold back water and diverted the Turia river away from the city. For more than six decades the system worked well. Why did it fail this year? Because the unusually warm sea made for an unusually bad storm, say some. Yet charts of rainfall in Spain show no trend towards a higher frequency of more extreme downpours\u2026Indeed, 24 hour torrential rainfall records back to 1940 don\u2019t sing the Climate Change song. Since 1982 human emissions of CO2 have grown from a cumulative total of 640 billion tons up to 1,800 billion tons and it hasn\u2019t made the slightest difference to downpours.Loading...jim2|November 13, 2024 at 5:56 pm|This is from Jo Nova\u2019s site.

Matt Ridley is wondering if removing 133 dams had anything to do with it, or if perhaps they should have built the big dam that was approved in 2001 but stopped by the Socialists in 2004: Dam shame: what really caused Valencia\u2019s floods?Matt Ridley, The Spectator \u2026 Valencia had a similarly terrible flood in 1957, in which 81 people died, long before climate change became the go-to excuse for any bad weather. After that flood, to prevent a recurrence, the Spanish government built a string of dams in the hills to hold back water and diverted the Turia river away from the city. For more than six decades the system worked well. Why did it fail this year? Because the unusually warm sea made for an unusually bad storm, say some. Yet charts of rainfall in Spain show no trend towards a higher frequency of more extreme downpours\u2026 Indeed, 24 hour torrential rainfall records back to 1940 don\u2019t sing the Climate Change song. Since 1982 human emissions of CO2 have grown from a cumulative total of 640 billion tons up to 1,800 billion tons and it hasn\u2019t made the slightest difference to downpours. jim2|November 13, 2024 at 5:56 pm|This is from Jo Nova\u2019s site.

I don\u2019t know how to show graphics at this blog so use Fig 1 and 1.5 athttp://globalclimatedrivers2.blogspot.com. Take a photon of energy at 667 wavenumber absorbed by a CO2 molecule. It\u2019s not clear what you mean by \u2018deactivated by collisions\u2019. The energy is conserved, collisions are the mechanism of gas phase thermal conduction wherein the energy is shared with surrounding molecules, some of which are water vapor. Schwarzschild\u2019s equation [40] accounts for this by assuming that \u201cas radiation passes through an isothermal layer, its monochromatic intensity exponentially approaches that of blackbody radiation corresponding to the temperature of the layer.\u201dAs shown in Fig 1.5 (which is for a typical line-of-sight), WV can radiate to space from low in the troposphere. So, energy absorbed by CO2 molecules can be conducted to WV molecules which can radiate the energy to space.As shown on Fig 1.5, the energy absorbed by CO2 and NOT radiated to space by CO2 is indicated by the notch above about 150 mW/m2/cm-1 and between about 600 and 740/cm up to about 350 mW/m2/cm-1. This energy didn\u2019t just disappear. It was conducted to WV molecules which radiated it to space. Comparison of the areas on the graph indicates that \u2018much\u2019 is roughly half.I agree that CO2 increase is essentially all a result of feedback from temperature increase. About 97 % of CO2 increase is natural so what else. CO2 is IR active so of course it contributes to warming in the troposphere. But at the surface, WV molecules outnumber CO2 molecules about 8000/430 = 18.5 to 1 so not a lot. Radiation from the stratosphere and above is almost all from CO2 which counters the warming from CO2 in the troposphere. The preponderance of evidence, some documented at Sect 2 inhttp://globalclimatedrivers2.blogspot.com, is that CO2 change doesn\u2019t cause significant net temperature change.I am not interested in conspiracy theories either. The comment re IPCC is my conclusion based on the preponderance of evidence. A key insight was acquired by the discovery that water vapor has been increasing about twice as fast as possible from just feedback from average global temperature increase.\u201cThe IPCC is one of the worst sources of dangerous misinformation\u201d John Clauser (Nobel laureate, 2022, physics)Loading...B A Bushaw|November 21, 2024 at 6:28 pm|Dan,\u201cAbout 97 % of CO2 increase is natural\u201dhttps://www.climate.gov/news-features/climate-qa/how-do-we-know-build-carbon-dioxide-atmosphere-caused-humansNever mind, I understand where your misrepresentation comes from (reservoir exchange), I\u2019m not interested.Clauser is projecting, and you are making an appeal to false authority.Thanks anyway \u2013 let me know when your manuscript is published.Loading...

So, energy absorbed by CO2 molecules can be conducted to WV molecules which can radiate the energy to space.As shown on Fig 1.5, the energy absorbed by CO2 and NOT radiated to space by CO2 is indicated by the notch above about 150 mW/m2/cm-1 and between about 600 and 740/cm up to about 350 mW/m2/cm-1.

Comparison of the areas on the graph indicates that \u2018much\u2019 is roughly half.I agree that CO2 increase is essentially all a result of feedback from temperature increase. About 97 % of CO2 increase is natural so what else. CO2 is IR active so of course it contributes to warming in the troposphere. But at the surface, WV molecules outnumber CO2 molecules about 8000/430 = 18.5 to 1 so not a lot.

But at the surface, WV molecules outnumber CO2 molecules about 8000/430 = 18.5 to 1 so not a lot. Radiation from the stratosphere and above is almost all from CO2 which counters the warming from CO2 in the troposphere.

So, energy absorbed by CO2 molecules can be conducted to WV molecules which can radiate the energy to space.As shown on Fig 1.5, the energy absorbed by CO2 and NOT radiated to space by CO2 is indicated by the notch above about 150 mW/m2/cm-1 and between about 600 and 740/cm up to about 350 mW/m2/cm-1.
