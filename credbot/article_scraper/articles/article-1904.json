the national debt to $36.9 trillion, the government must tighten its belt and cut costs. After the House passed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and it moved to the Senate, President Trump took the next step in his efforts to cut waste, fraud, and abuse bysubmittinga $9.4 billion rescission package to Congress on June 3, 2025. The proposal includes $1.1 billion in cuts for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), which funds the Public Broadcasting Service and National Public Radio, along with unnecessary and wasteful foreign aid spending. Citizens Against Government Waste (CAGW) agrees with Sen. John Cornyn, whosaidthis is a \u201cgood start\u201d and \u201cWe need to do about one a month.\u201d The use of a rescissions package is challenging for any President. According to theCongressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974, a president cannot refuse to spend (impound) congressionally appropriated funds unless Congress agrees to this decision. Cutting spending that has been appropriated requires the submission of a rescissions proposal, after which Congress has 45 days to vote to approve. Rescission legislation is filibuster-proof and only requires a simple majority in both chambers of Congress. Congress can amend the provisions in the President\u2019s proposal but cannot change the list of cuts or add more spending. According to a July 16, 2020, Government Accountability Officereport, since the enactment of the Congressional Budget Act, Congress has approved $25 billion out of the $92 billion in proposed rescissions. President Trump proposed rescissions in his first term, but they were rejected by the Senate. The $9.4 billion rescissions package includes programs that have been identified in CAGW\u2019s2024 Prime Cutsreport, like international organizations and the CPB. The next package could include more cuts to federal agencies whose functions should be purely private, like eliminating the National Endowment for the Arts and National Endowment for the Humanities, which wouldsave$2 billion over five years. Congress should quickly consider and approve the rescissions. With a $36.9 trillion debt and interest on that debt the largest expenditure other than Social Security, the need for more and even larger rescissions packages is clear. **Post navigation** This Week in Waste \u2013 June 6, 2025byGrigory MenshikovJune 6, 2025 Citizens Against Government Waste works to eliminate waste, fraud, abuse, and mismanagement in government through research and public education.
