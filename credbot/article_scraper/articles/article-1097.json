It\u2019s why we snapped ourfall fashion featurethere back in 2021, and among the reasons why this pair picked it for their engagement photos. Take a look at their story, photographed byAnthony Page, below. The couple:Maya Torain and Zachary Blackwell How they met:As with many modern couples, Maya and Zach first connected on Hinge, in 2018. She was studying at Duke, and he was at North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University. Maya jokingly messaged him, \u201cIf I\u2019m still single when you make it to Durham, maybe I\u2019ll go on a date.\u201d The proposal story:The two were together for about six years before getting engaged. Four of those years were long distance, when Maya was in Philly and Zach in Atlanta. He eventually moved to Philadelphia in February 2024. And in May of that same year, on a trip to Mexico, Zach got down on one knee. \u201cI was completely surprised and think I blacked out for a moment, but it was a resounding yes,\u201d says Maya. The engagement-session approach:Maya and Zach wanted the setting to feel true to them as a couple. Their photographer suggested that they start at their apartment. Their dog, Ranger, made a cameo. On the rooftop:The pair credit their photographer for making them feel so comfortable during the shoot, particularly on the rooftop of their apartment: Maya describes them as two awkward giraffes who found each other. She\u2019s almost six feet tall, and Zach is six feet, four inches. \u201cBy the middle, we felt like two ofAmerica\u2019s Next Top Models!\u201d she says. The main event:For their other location, they moved to La Chinesca in Callowhill \u2014 a go-to eatery for the duo, who love indulging in the wonton chips, tacos, and margaritas. It\u2019s also a good place to de-stress from the week, says Maya. The attire:Maya and Zach sport athletic-wear 90 percent of the time, so they wanted to find clothing that made them feel comfortable and beautiful, but not too formal. Maya ordered little white dresses online, and Zach went shopping. But, in very Zach-Maya fashion, they made their outfit decisions about 10 minutes before Page arrived. They couldn\u2019t be happier with the results. The wedding plans:The couple plans to say \u201cI do\u201d in July atUnion Trustin Washington Square West. If it were up to us, their after-party would be at La Chinesca. Get more great content from Philadelphia Wedding:FACEBOOK|INSTAGRAM|NEWSLETTER Getting married?
