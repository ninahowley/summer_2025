Located on the coast of southern China, the territory of Hong Kong spent much of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries as a British colony, caught, in a quirk of history, between two worlds. Colorfully showcasing this identity,a collection of travel postersheld byHong Kong Baptist Universityoffers insight into the city\u2019s unique place in the global imagination over the decades. Many of the collection\u2019s more than 100 posters hark back to the golden age of international aviation, featuring now-defunct names likeBOACandPan Am. History and tradition feature prominently in their rhetoric but so do themes of modernity and cosmopolitanism. After all, the clich\u00e9 of Hong Kong as a place where \u201cEast meets West\u201d is,according to D. J. Huppatz, \u201ca common stereotype that continues to be used in contemporary criticism, journalism, and tourism promotion.\u201d One of the oldest items in the collection dates to 1935, the year that the Hong Kong Travel Association (HKTA) was established. The poster is signed by S. D. Panaiotaky, who also designed several other travel flyers promoting Hong Kong as a destination. Calling attention to the warm color palette and view of the sun-drenched harbor, the poster bills Hong Kong as \u201cThe Riviera of the Orient,\u201d a tagline that also served as thetitle of a guidebookpublished by the HKTA around the same time. The atmosphere of leisure and ease is accentuated by the picture\u2019s focal point: a white tourist in a summer suit, journeying uphill in a sedan carried by two barefoot Chinese men. Bruce A. Chan, who grew up in mid-century Hong Kong, recalls that the city\u2019s Peak and Mid-levels districts were European-only residential areas before World War II, as \u201c[c]oncern for hygiene and comfort drove the colonials to live at the higher altitudes of Victoria Peak where they could escape the noise, congestion and poor sanitation of downtown.\u201d An American President Lines (APL) ad from the late 1950s has an \u201c[u]nusual and forward-looking design\u201d for its bilingual exhortation to \u201cVisit Hong Kong.\u201d Beneath the prominent photograph of the Tiger Balm Gardens pagoda in Hong Kong, the poster shows a smaller picture of the SSPresident Clevelandpassenger ship sailing under the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco\u2014the reverse voyage on a transpacific route that countlessChinese migrantshad long taken to California\u2019s \u201cGold Mountain.\u201d From the 1850s, Hong Kong was \u201cthe gateway to the Pacific as well as a pivot in the Cantonese diaspora,\u201dwrites Elizabeth Sinn. One hundred years later, ocean liners\u2014a mode of transport that Tricia Cusack argues helped topopularize the reach of the British Empirefor upper-class travelers\u2014would be superseded by the convenience of commercial air travel. Still, Hong Kong remains a key node in global shipping networks. Writes Sinn, \u201cWhen the Pacific Ocean turned into a highway for Chinese seeking Gold Mountain, it marked a new era for the history of South China, California, and the ocean itself.\u201d Besides thePresident Cleveland, another ship in the APL\u2019s fleet was the SSPresident Wilson, which operated from 1948 to 1973 on the shipping line\u2019s transpacific service. As the collection\u2019s curator notes, a poster from the early 1960s \u201callows APL to show their ship steaming into Hong Kong past a Chinese sailing junk, juxtaposing not just East and West but also modernity and tradition. From ships to jets, Hong Kong\u2019s story as an aviation hub would be incomplete without Cathay Pacific Airways. The company\u2019s name evokes acenturies-old Western image of Chinaand, in one early poster advertising travel to Hong Kong, Cathay Pacific offers a scene that shows a \u201ctraditional\u201d Chinese family aboard a sailing junk staring in awe at the modern high-rise city and jet plane in the distance. Commercial flight was historically a profession that opened doors to the world for women workers, especially as it wasassociated with globe-trotting glitz. However, female flight attendants also faced considerable discrimination, as they were expected to conform to stereotypes around race and gender.Stewardesses on Japan Airlines\u201chad to simultaneously represent modernityandexoticism when they flew from the East to the West\u201d in the 1950s, Yoshiko Nakano argues. The experience of the Cathay Pacific flight attendants featured on a 1959 poster may have been similar. Even though Asian employees clearly appear in the line-up of uniformed Cathay Pacific crew on the tarmac, the copy touts the carrier as \u201ca British airline with British pilots.\u201d The Hong Kong Tourist Association, a successor to the pre-war Hong Kong Travel Association, was launched in 1957 as the brainchild of executive directorH. F. Stanley, a Briton who took an interest inpromoting a distinctive identityfor the British colony. An early poster from the new version of the HKTA illustrates how colonial admen stressed continuity with a longer Chinese cultural tradition as a selling point for visitors to Hong Kong. The poster juxtaposes the antique painting of an anonymous \u201cChinese girl\u201d with the photograph of what the caption calls \u201ca modern Chinese girl against a traditional Chinese mural.\u201d Images of traditional Chinese garments were historically used to represent China as \u201cas an ancient but stagnant country,\u201d writes Heather Chan in her analysis of the evolving portrayals of Chinese fashion inVoguemagazine from the 1890s to 1940s. At the same time, Anne Anlin Cheng theorizes that Western culture turns the figure of the \u201cyellow woman\u201d into \u201can inherently aesthetic object,\u201d in a phenomenon she dubs ornamentalism. Chinese women\u2019s bodies are the focus of the poster\u2019s marketing, yet its tagline, \u201cSome of the nicest things about Hong Kong haven\u2019t changed at all,\u201d is stamped with the British crest. Ina Japan Air Lines posterfrom the same period, eagle-eyed viewers will similarly spot the flag of the British merchant navy in the background. The British Overseas Airways Corporation, or BOAC, advertised its connections to \u201cthe big round world\u201d with an exhortation for travelers to \u201cstop off in the Far East\u201d around 1970. A c. 1970 promotional poster advertising BOAC\u2019s services positions Hong Kong as a synecdoche for the Far East as a whole, depicting a white tourist couple on the promenade of a floating restaurant in Aberdeen harbor, a popular destination at the time. But one of the tourists in the poster isn\u2019t looking at the boats on the water: his gaze is directed at a cheongsam-clad local woman\u2014maybe a waitress?\u2014shown only from behind. The poster references the 1960 filmThe World of Suzie Wong, which, featuring a Chinese sex worker as a main character,popularized the qipao as \u201cthe Suzie Wong dress\u201d in the West. (The character of Suzie Wong also etched a notorious and unwanted link between \u201cany yellow(-looking/sounding/tasting/smelling) women\u201d and \u201cthe under-world of porn industry, mail bride industry, global sex trafficking, etc.,\u201dKyoo Lee argues.) Today, the waterfront settlement of Aberdeen \u201chouses Hong Kong\u2019s largest and most important remaining marine community,\u201d reports Victor Tsz Hin Leung. It\u2019s crowded with houseboats, fishing vessels, roving vendors in sampans, and multi-story floating restaurants that drew tourists until the COVID-19 pandemic forced them to shutter. Dating to roughly 1977, the above poster by the Taiwanese China Airlines (CAL) encourages passengers to \u201cFly CAL to Hong Kong.\u201d The carrier began flying into Hong Kong in the 1960s. The poster offers an aerial view of the destination, showing Hong Kong harbor and the New World Tower being constructed on Queen\u2019s Road Central. However, the photo has been printed in reverse. Showing the city\u2019s high-rise buildings from a different angle, Hong Kong\u2019s night-time skyline shines in a poster printed by the Australian flag carrier Qantas in the 1970s.As early as 1950, travel posters played up Hong Kong\u2019s urban landscape\u2014what Tsung-yi Huang calls the \u201cmuch-publicized image of the dazzling \u2018Pearl of the Orient,\u2019 a capital showcase displaying nothing but spectacle and fantasy\u201d at odds with the city\u2019s reality. Still, there\u2019s much more to Hong Kong than the glamour of its modern skyscrapers. Published by the Hong Kong Tourist Association, a c. 1980 poster shows an old woman tending a pair of cows amid lush greenery, with rolling hills in the background. In fact, the British possession of Hong Kong extended beyond Hong Kong Island and the Kowloon peninsula. Much of its land area lay in the New Territories, which wereimportant to the colonial governmentbecause of the potential of their agricultural and mineral resources. The HKTA had long championed the tourism potential of the New Territories. Not long after it was set up in the 1960s, it commissioneda landscape paintingthat depicted the view of Hong Kong and Kowloon from the agricultural hinterland. \u201cDotted with villages, peopled by villagers, worked by buffaloes, decorated with paddy-fields and duck farms, the New Territories boasts pagodas like the Temple of 10,000 Buddhas, overlooking Shatin Valley,\u201d the association\u2019s advertisement enthused. In 1974, the organization further offered funding for academics to researchhistorical Chinese buildings in the New Territories, resulting in a publication on rural architecture. Besides architecture, the HKTA also highlighted other aspects of culture, as in a photograph of two chefs with Chinese dishes laid out before them. In 1980, when the poster was published, Hongkongers could see the writing on the wall for the British, with talks under way to return sovereignty to the People\u2019s Republic of China. Despite their shared Cantonese cultural heritage, Hong Kong\u2019s cuisine differed markedly from that of the neighboringChinese province of Guangzhou. \u201cThe two decades leading up to the 1997 Handover witnessed an intense and unprecedented interest in Hong Kong culture,\u201d writes Daisy Sheung Yuen Ng. A \u201cfear of the disappearance of Hong Kong\u2019s way of life\u201d under Chinese rule fueled a nostalgic frenzy for the romanticized trappings of \u201cOld Hong Kong.\u201d Get your fix of JSTOR Daily\u2019s best stories in your inbox each Thursday.

A Hong Kong Tourism Board poster from 1998 bills \u201cVisionary Hong Kong\u201d as both a bridge between East and West and \u201cthe pathway to the future.\u201d Even with the city\u2019smajor changesinthe last century, tourism retains a significant role in the Hong Kong economy. The story told by the travel posters in this collection documents the historical growth and captures the shifting mood of a remarkable, truly global city. Support JSTOR Daily!
