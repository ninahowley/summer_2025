Pat Lynch was honored at an event last year, a year after being diagnosed with cancer in his right kidney, by the group ROAR (Radiation Oncology Accelerated Research). Money raised by ROAR benefits the programs of the UAB Department of Radiation Oncology. In a story byOver the Mountain Journal,Julie Kimthe second vice president of ROAR described Lynch saying, \u201cAs a community leader, respected businessman, and recent cancer survivor, Pat Lynch has demonstrated strength and courage in the face of an unforgiving disease and has come out on the other side with hope and positivity.\u201d AL Today spoke to multiple elected officials and members of the community in Hoover who described Lynch\u2019s trustworthiness and character; each person expressed the same level of shock and disbelief that MayorFrank Brocato,accused Lynch of blackmailduring hearings related to a contested Certificate of Need. The ongoing hearings have produced a number of revelationsincluding the fact that the City of Hooveris currently undergoing a previously undisclosed forensic audit. Lynch denied the mayor\u2019s accusations in a notarized affidavit and later in a statement released to the media and posted by him on social media. Lynch was called as a witness in the hearings however his attorney objected. In a Motion to Quash the Subpoena reviewed by Alabama TodayRhett Owens, Lynch\u2019s attorney, cited concerns by medical professionals to object to his participation. However, the Motion also included an emphasize that the city and media have sought to ignore, \u201cIn addition to Mr. Lynch\u2019s compromised medical condition, if Mr. Lynch were asked questions about the Brocato call during the Hearing, he would state only that he stands by the statements made in his May 7, 2024 affidavit and in his public statement relating to the Brocato call and, on the advice of counsel, is invoking his rights under the Fifth Amendment in refusing to answer additional questions posed during the Hearing relating to the Brocato call.\u201d There was no ambiguity in the Motion, Lynch stood by his sworn affidavit denying the claims of blackmail and presenting his version of the conversation. That didn\u2019t prevent the attorneys for the City of Hoover during yesterday\u2019s hearing for the contested Certificate of Need from insinuating that the sworn affidavit should not be introduced as evidence because they deemed the sworn defense of his reputation and allegations of criminal conduct \u201cworthless,\u201d if they couldn\u2019t cross-examine Lynch on the state. In later testimony, the City admitted to what has been described as \u201ctampering\u201d with the date on one of its sworn affidavits. Collin Luke one of the city attorneys said of Lynch and his attorney, \u201cafter discussions with my partner, Mr. Kirby, he said that he would take \u2014 his lawyer said he would take the Fifth if asked about the affidavit that he filed in this proceeding. That\u2019s on advice of counsel.\u201d Hoover\u2019s Council went on to repeat that line a second time to the judge. Reiterating that if called \u201che would just take the Fifth.\u201d Again, that is not what Lynch\u2019s attorney\u2019s Motion stated. It reinforced his intention to stand by his affidavit but under the advice of his legal counsel not to speak beyond it. The Hoover Sunoriginally picked up the false narrative provided and pushed by the city and failed to include the assertation that Lynch would stand by his previous statements saying only, \u201cLynch was called to testify Thursday but submitted a filing with the judge Thursday morning saying he was too ill to testify and that, even if he did appear, would plead the Fifth Amendment about the phone conversation with the mayor, exercising his right to remain silent and not incriminate himself.\u201d They later edited the story to say, \u201cLynch was called to testify Thursday but submitted a filing with the judge Thursday morning saying he was too ill to testify and that, even if he did appear, would stand by his original affidavit and plead the Fifth Amendment about any additional questions regarding the phone conversation with the mayor, exercising his right to remain silent and not incriminate himself.\u201d Meanwhile, many Hoover residents have made their support of Lynch clear in the same local FaceBook group in which he posted his personal statement. *Editors Note: Shortly after this story was published Alabama Today recieved word that Pat Lynch has been readmitted to the hospital.
