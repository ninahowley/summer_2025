Council session over Mayor Bowser\u2019s plan to end sanctuary city status draws strong pushback** WASHINGTON\u2014A mass protest by D.C. residents jammed the City Council\u2019s chambers on June 2 over Democratic Mayor Muriel Bowser\u2019s plan to end the \u201csanctuary city\u201d status of the Nation\u2019s Capital.Bowser\u2019s plan is in her proposed city budget for the next fiscal year. It \u201cshamefully includes a repeal of the Sanctuary Cities Act,\u201d which protects migrants to D.C., a fact sheet says. The law bans local police from cooperating with President Donald Trump\u2019s Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents.That Bowser plan produced the May 2 protest, from members of the coalition formed to protect Black and brown people from ICE. After gathering and speaking outside the John Wilson Building, D.C.\u2019s city hall, they trooped inside to make legislators hear their voices. It followed other protests weeks before.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of abuse by law enforcement,\u201d explained Kaya Chatterjee, executive director ofFree DC, a coalition formed to lobby to make the capital the nation\u2019s 51st state.\u201cThey try to divide us and they try to dominate us,\u201d Chatterjee said of Trump and others like him. \u201cThey try to use these threats to make us obey in advance,\u201d and not resist. \u201cWe\u2019ll stick together across our communities so they can\u2019t\u201d achieve that goal, Chatterjee told the multiracial crowd.ICE agents raid D.C. restaurants and other businesses and have grabbed an estimated 189 people\u2014all people of color\u2014out of cars, houses, workplaces, and off city streets, the coalition\u2019s fact sheet says. It reports ICE raids at more than 100 restaurants and adds that families have been separated.But \u201cMayor Bowser and council members have remained silent and idle.\u201d Now the mayor wants to \u201ccapitulate\u201d to Trump and \u201cfurther criminalize Brown and Black families,\u201d the coalition asserts.\u201cI came to this country to work. I left my family behind like so many others, hoping for a better life, but instead, I found a harsh reality, low wages, labor abuse, harassment, and fear. Under this political climate, it is worse than before, much, much worse than before,\u201d said Antonia Pena, co-executive director of the D.C.-Maryland-Virginia chapter of the National Domestic Workers Alliance, one of two unions listed as protest sponsors. The Restaurant Opportunities Center is the other.\u201cIn recent months, we have learned that workers have been sexually harassed, but they are too afraid to report it because of the immigration threat. A domestic worker has still not received her pay, but her employer is threatening to call ICE if she dares to demand what she is owed\u2026Abusive employers take advantage in this political climate.\u201cThis is not just something that we want,\u201d Pena said of D.C. being a sanctuary city. \u201cIt is something that we need. D.C. has the opportunity to be a brave city that doesn\u2019t cower and that protects its people regardless of the color of their skin,\u201d against what Pena called \u201cthis fascistic government\u201d of Trump.\u201cOver and over again, Bowser has done everything she can to restrict immigrants\u2019 access to safety and support,\u201d said Amy Fisher, a migrant rights organizer from Ward 7 east of the Anacostia River.\u201cAnd since January, we\u2019ve seen our immigrants, their families, their friends, and their neighbors\u2014hundreds of them\u2014snatched out of their homes and thrust into the Trump administration\u2019s immigration gulag.\u201dThe Trump regime has backed the ICE raids, in D.C. and nationwide, with a threat to pull federal funds from cities and states that set themselves up as sanctuaries and don\u2019t cooperate with ICE. That hasn\u2019t stopped D.C., and most of its suburbs, plus Baltimore, from becoming sanctuaries.Other cities that are sanctuaries include Chicago, New York, Los Angeles, Boston, and the entire state of California. \u201cDon\u2019t take the bait,\u201d of keeping federal cash, Fisher warned D.C. \u201cFight efforts to throw our neighbors into the jaws of Trump\u2019s deportation machine.\u201dBut New York Mayor Eric Adams has turned against that metropolis\u2019s \u201csanctuary city\u201d ordinance and ordered city prison guards to cooperate with ICE. In return, Trump ordered his Justice Department to drop multiple fraud charges against Adams in a case so solid that the Republican Acting U.S. Attorney for that area resigned in protest.And in Boston, Rep. Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass., convened a roundtable on June 2 with local advocates and elected to discuss further measures to battle ICE in the Bay State. Their message:\u201cHands off our immigrant neighbors.\u201dPressley cited \u201can uptick in ICE activity across the Massachusetts 7th Congressional District and the Commonwealth, including a series of harrowing incidents in East Boston, Chelsea, Everett, and other predominantly immigrant communities.\u201dBowser\u2019s plan to end D.C.\u2019s sanctuary city status also caught the eye of Rep. Adriano Espaillat, D-N.Y., the Congressional Hispanic Caucus chair. \u201cThe D.C. Metropolitan Police Department is not the FBI or ICE,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cThey are trained differently, they respond differently, they have different relationships with the community. To deputize local police officers as federal agents is a huge mistake.\u201cI hope she\u2019s not being intimidated by that guy at the White House, and that he\u2019s threatening to withhold funding. Because that has a terminology\u2014it\u2019s called extortion.\u201dBoth outside the Wilson Building and in the day-long budget hearing inside, the D.C. residents argued to keep the sanctuary city status\u2014and challenged the council to stand up to Trump.\u201cWe are going to go inside because we don\u2019t have anyone brave enough [on the council] to stop Trump and protect our communities,\u201d said rally moderator Antonia Salazar.And they won\u2019t stop with the council session, added Chatterjee of Free DC. \u201cWe the people are committed to solidarity and collective courage, through organizing and training so we have a massive pro-democracy movement that is rooted on our values,\u201d Chatterjee said. \u201cNobody is free until everybody is free, so let\u2019s get everybody free.\u201dWe hope you appreciated this article.
