Trump also authorized the Pentagon to dispatch regular US troops \u201cas necessary\u201d to support the California National Guard. The president\u2019s orders did not specify rules of engagement about when and how force could be used. California Governor Gavin Newsom, who did not request the National Guard and asserted it was not needed, criticized the president\u2019s decision as \u201cinflammatory\u201d and warned it \u201cwill only escalate tensions.\u201d I ama historianwho has written several books about the Vietnam War, one of the most divisive episodes in our nation\u2019s past. My recent book, \u201cKent State: An American Tragedy,\u201d examines ahistoric clash on May 4, 1970, between anti-war protesters and National Guard troops at Kent State University in Ohio. The confrontation escalated into violence: troops opened fire on the demonstrators, killing four students and wounding nine others, including one who was paralyzed for life. In my view, dispatching California National Guard troops against civilian protesters in Los Angeles chillingly echoes decisions and actions that led to the tragic Kent State shooting. Someactive-duty units, as well asNational Guard troops, are better prepared today than in 1970 to respond to riots and violent protests \u2013 but the vast majority of their training and their primary mission remains to fight, to kill and to win wars. TheNational Guardis a force of state militias under the command of governors. It can be federalized by the president during times of national emergency or for deployment on combat missions overseas. Guardsmen train for one weekend per month and two weeks every summer. Typically, the Guard has been deployed to deal with natural disasters and supportlocal police responses to urban unrest. Examples include riots inDetroit in 1967,Washington DC in 1968, Los Angelesin 1965and 1992, andMinneapolis and other cities in 2020after the death of George Floyd. Presidents rarely deploy National Guard troops without state governors\u2019 consent. The main modern exceptions occurred in the 1950s and 1960s during the Civil Rights Movement, when Southern governors defied federal court orders to desegregate schools inArkansas,MississippiandAlabama. In each case, the federal government sent troops to protect Black students from crowds of white protesters. **Latest stories** **A cure for Indonesia\u2019s ailing and corrupt health system** **Shooting journalists in Trump\u2019s America** **Asia\u2019s shaky economies need a US-China trade truce, fast** The1807 Insurrection Actgrants presidents authority to use active-duty troops or National Guard forces to restore order within the United States. President Trumpdid not invoke the Insurrection Act. Instead, he relied on Section 12406 of Title 10 of the US Code, anarrower federal statutethat allows the president to mobilize the National Guard in situations including \u201crebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of the Government of the United States.\u201d Trump did not limit his order to Los Angeles. He authorized armed forces to protect immigration enforcement operations at any \u201clocationswhere protests against these functions are occurring or are likelyto occur.\u201d The war in Vietnam had grown increasingly unpopular by early 1970, but protests intensified on April 30 when President Richard Nixon authorizedexpanding the conflict into Cambodia. At Kent State, after a noontime anti-war rally on campus on May 1, alcohol-fueled students harassed passing motorists in town and smashed storefront windows that night. On May 2, anti-war protestersset fire to the buildingwhere military officers trained Kent State students enrolled in the armed forces\u2019 Reserve Officer Training Corps program. In response, Republican Governor Jim Rhodes dispatched National Guard troops, against the advice of the university and many local officials, who understood the mood in the town of Kent and on campus far better than Rhodes did. County prosecutor Ron Kane hadvehemently warned Rhodesthat deploying the National Guard could spark conflict and lead to fatalities. Nonetheless, Rhodes \u2013 who was trailing in an impending Republican primary for a U.S. Senate seat \u2013 struck the pose of a take-charge leader who wasn\u2019t going to be pushed around by a long-haired rabble. \u201cWe\u2019re going to put a stop to this!\u201d he shouted, pounding the table at a press conference in Kent on May 3. Hundreds of National Guard troops were deployed across town and on campus. University officials announced thatfurther rallies were banned. Nonetheless, on May 4, some 2,000 to 3,000 students gathered on the campus Commons for another anti-war rally. They were met by 96 National Guardsmen, led by eight officers. There was confrontation in the air as student anger over Nixon\u2019s expansion of the war blended with resentment over the Guard\u2019s presence. Protesters chanted antiwar slogans, shouted epithets at the Guardsmen and made obscene gestures. The Guardsmen sent to Kent State had no training in de-escalating tension or minimizing the use of force. Nonetheless, their commanding officer that day, Ohio Army National Guard Assistant Adjutant General Robert Canterbury, decided to use them to break up what the Department of Justicelater deemed a legal assembly. In my view, it was a reckless judgment that inflamed an already volatile situation. Students started showering the greatly outnumbered Guardsmen with rocks and other objects. In violation of Ohio Army National Guard regulations, Canterburyneglected to warn the studentsthat he had ordered Guardsmens\u2019 rifles loaded with live ammunition. As tension mounted, Canterbury failed to adequately supervise his increasingly fearful troops \u2013 a cardinal responsibility of the commanding officer on the scene. This fundamental failure of leadership increased confusion and resulted in a breakdown of fire control discipline \u2013 officers\u2019 responsibility to maintain tight control over their troops\u2019 discharge of weapons. When protesters neared the Guardsmen,platoon sergeant Mathew McManusshouted \u201cFire in the air!\u201d in a desperate attempt to prevent bloodshed. McManus intended for troops to shoot above the students\u2019 heads to warn them off. But some Guardsmen, wearing gas masks that made it hard to hear amid the noise and confusion, only heard or reacted to the first word of McManus\u2019 order, and fired at the students. The troops had not been trained to fire warning shots, which was contrary to National Guard regulations. And McManus had no authority to issue an order to fire if officers were nearby, as they were. **Sign up for one of our free newsletters** The Daily ReportStart your day right with Asia Times' top stories AT Weekly ReportA weekly roundup of Asia Times' most-read stories Many National Guardsmen who were at Kent State on May 4 later questioned why they had been deployed there. \u201cLoaded rifles and fixed bayonets are pretty harsh solutions for students exercising free speech on an American campus,\u201d one of themtold an oral history interviewer. Another plaintively asked me in a 2023 interview, \u201cWhy would you put soldiers trained to kill on a university campus to serve a police function?\u201d National Guard equipment and training have improved significantly in the decades since Kent State. But Guardsmen are still military troops who are fundamentally trained to fight, not to control crowds. In 2020, then-National Guard Bureau Chief General Joseph Lengyel told reporters that \u201cthe civil unrest mission is one of themost difficult and dangerous missions\u2026 in our domestic portfolio.\u201d In my view, the tragedy of Kent State shows how critical it is for authorities to be thoughtful in responding to protests, and extremely cautious in deploying military troops to deal with them. The application of force is inherently unpredictable, often uncontrollable, and can lead to fatal mistakes and lasting human suffering. And while protests sometimes break rules, they may not bedisruptive or harmful enoughto merit responding with force. Aggressive displays of force, in fact, can heighten tensions and worsen situations. Conversely, research shows that if protesters perceive that authorities are acting with restraint and treating them with respect, they aremore likely to remain nonviolent. The shooting at Kent State demonstrated that using military force in these situations is an option fraught with grave risks.
