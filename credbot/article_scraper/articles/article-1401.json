What else would you add? **Advertisement** Getting a Bank ID When asked to list their worst bureaucratic headaches in Norway the single most widespread gripe among our international readership and online groups was the complex and drawn-out process of obtaining a BankID, Norway\u2019s digital identity system. Without it, daily life grinds to a halt. \u201cYou are effectively locked out of Norwegian society,\u201d one reader said. \u201cNo mobile phone number, no online shopping, no Vipps. There are some places where that is the only payment option, which is very frustrating.\" One respondent, Abby Noble, described it as a \u201cchicken and egg\u201d conundrum. To get a BankID, you need a bank account. But to open a bank account, you need a registered address \u2014 which you often can\u2019t get without a bank account. \"Why is a bank account necessary for having access to your health page in Norway?\" complained Sebastian Rojas, from Chile.

The frustrations of having a D-number Many people, such as newly arrived asylum seekers or EU citizens planning to work in Norway for less than six months, or other foreign workers on job seeker permits, are only eligible for aD-number,which can make it hard to open a bank account or access a wide range of other services. Megan Thorsen said that after she was given a D-number on the back of her job-seeker visa, she struggled to set up something as basic as an internet connection. Others found that banks simply had no process for D-number holders, even when they had job offers in hand. \u201cI went to four banks,\u201d one reader recalled. \u201cEventually my Norwegian friend called his banker, who was shocked they couldn\u2019t help. They just hadn\u2019t seen the issue before.\u201d But even getting a D-number seemed to take some time. \u201cWithout a D-number, you are nobody. And nobody tells you what you\u2019re supposed to do next,\" one respondent moaned. **Advertisement** READ ALSO:How to switch from a D-number to af\u00f8dselsnummerin Norway Trouble opening bank accounts It wasn't only people on D-visas who had trouble opening bank accounts. One Polish respondent said the most frustrating thing about living and working in Norway was simply \"waiting\". \"Over two months to open a bank account!\" he exclaimed. \"I think the response time to get all the papers ready is sometimes too much,\" Sebastian Rojas said. \"To get my National ID number and the bank account took me at least three months. Without those two things in Norway you are very restricted to what you can actually do.\" Banks require physical documents, which are sent by post, and Norwegian post won\u2019t deliver unless your name is on the letter box. \u201cIt was a nightmare,\u201d said Abby Noble. \u201cI was only able to solve it thanks to kind Airbnb owners and friends I made at Norskkurs.\u201d READ ALSO:What you need to know about opening a bank account in Norway UDI processing times **Advertisement** The Norwegian Directorate of Immigration (UDI) also came in for heavy criticism \u2014 particularly for long waits for family reunification and citizenship applications. \u201cFamily visas are taking 12 to 15 months,\u201d said Frida Cota, who had to endure a long-distance relationship while waiting. \"Citizenship applications are now taking 30 months if they are not automatically processed. And nobody knows or will tell what the criteria is for automatic processing.\" Carla Colombon, from Mexico, was unable to work for over 18 months while waiting to get all the necessary paperwork done. \u201cSuch a waste of time and skills and super expensive for my partner and me to live on only one income.\" She said it has also been \"incredibly frustrating\" not to be able to travel freely when living in Norway on a temporary visa. **Advertisement** Problems getting appointments/phone contact \"Have you tried calling any institutions? Waiting times of 30 min and more,\" complained one anonymous respondent, who described Norway as \"close to a failed state\". \"And there is no feedback, as in normal countries (you don't get an option to evaluate how the phone call went)\". \"When you have to register in the country, the next appointment with the police is like half a year away somewhere in Finnmark,\" the commenter added. Contradictory answers/poor information Several respondents complained of getting contradictory information from different government officials, or on different government websites. \"The information is not coherent,\" complained Elva Popsen from Greece. \"When you register at UDI as a job seeker, nobody tells you that you should go to NAV [the unemployment service]. Also at the tax office, nobody tells you that you should try NAV first if you don't have a job yet.\" \"Any interaction with government institutions leads to contradictory answers,\" agreed an anonymous respondent, pointing to a \"discrepancy between what is indicated on the website and what was provided by direct communication\". Lack of understanding among ordinary Norwegians \"The challenges immigrants face are not relatable to most locals,\" Amber Renee explained. \"They\u2019ve never had to get a personal number, never had to deal with UDI, and never had to understand or care about any of these processes.\" \"This seems to carry over to the native Norwegians who design the processes or are working in service positions for the bureaucracy. They still do not relate or understand the full picture and do not really care because it doesn\u2019t affect them.\" Would you add any other obvious bureaucratic hurdles?
