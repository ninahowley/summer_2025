One panelist, Logan Hall, denounced \u201cmass immigration\u201d as a \u201chate crime,\u201d and claimed that \u201csome people just are not compatible with our civilization.\u201d On X, Hall, who is employed as a Digital Strategist for Blaze Media, has a history of criticizing multiculturalism, making disparaging remarks about immigrants, and interacting with overt white supremacists: In a Dec. 23, 2024 post, Hallwrotethat his \u201clocal mall\u201d was \u201ccompletely overrun with illiterate foreigners and their families.\u201d In another from the same day, hecomplainedabout \u201chearing five different foreign languages and seeing people from all over the world wearing their weird ethnic garb.\u201d Hall hascomparedimmigrants to Orcs, a mythical race of monsters from J.R.R. Tolkien\u2019sLord of the Ringstrilogy. Of Rep. Shri Thanedar, an Indian-American Congressman, Hallwrote, \u201csomething tells me this guy\u2019s ancestors didn\u2019t come over on the mayflower [sic].\u201d He also accused Thanedar of \u201cparasite behavior.\u201d Hall: \u201ci can trace my lineage here back before the revolution. some third world foreigner who just happens to sneak over the border and give birth does not make that child an american [sic] like me and it\u2019s insane to pretend otherwise.\u201d Hallwrote\u201ci would gladly pay $100 for eggs if it means i never have to see another third world immigrant in my country ever again.\u201d Hallposted an imageadvocating \u201cremigration,\u201d awhite supremacisttermwhichrefers tothe mass expulsion of non-white people from majority-white countries. Hereferred tobirthright citizenship, which is guaranteed by the 14th Amendment, as \u201cnational suicide\u201d and a \u201cwar on americans [sic] whose ancestors built this country and the future they sacrificed for.\u201d In response to the Trump administration freezing foreign aid, Hallwrote, \u201ci don\u2019t care about fighting AIDS in sudan [sic].\u201d On multiple occasions Hall has interacted with known white supremacists on X, includingPatrick Casey(former head ofIdentity Evropa),Kevin DeAnna(whoblogs under the pen name \u201cJames Kirkpatrick\u201d),Geoffrey Martin(a Neo-Nazibetter known by the pseudonym \u201cCaptive Dreamer\u201d), andMichael Gramer(whooperates under the pseudonym \u201c9mm_SMG\u201d). On the June 2, 2025 episode ofSara Gonzales Unfiltered, Hall echoed many of these same sentiments. Responding to news that the Boulder attacker, who was armed with incendiary devices and wanted to target \u201cZionists,\u201d had beencharged with a federal hate crime, Gonzales called the concept of hate crimes \u201cridiculous.\u201d But, she added that \u201cif we\u2019re gonna apply that standard, we should apply it equally.\u201d \u201cHowever, if we\u2019re gonna apply that standard, we should apply it equally,\u201d Gonzales said. \u201cRight? And so often, they are so willing to say, oh, if a white male commits a crime, let\u2019s try to find the hate crime there. So it\u2019s, like, alright. If we\u2019ve got hate crimes, then we need to apply that standard equally.\u201d Likewise, Logan Hall stated that he is \u201cnot a big fan\u201d of \u201cdesignating things as hate crimes either,\u201d but that \u201cif we\u2019re gonna be classifying them in that way, I think mass immigration is a hate crime against America.\u201d And he claimed that \u201cillegals\u201d were brought into the country by the Biden administration to \u201cwreak havoc\u201d on it. He also asserted that \u201cthe Left\u201d hates Jews because they \u201csee Jews as white,\u201d and that the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians \u201cshould not really concern us.\u201d Hall added that he doesn\u2019t \u201cknow why we\u2019re importing all these people with ethnic blood feuds halfway across the world,\u201d and called for mass deportations. \u201cAt a certain point, we\u2019re gonna have to say some people just are not compatible with our civilization, okay?\u201d Hall said. \u201cAnd this is why mass deportations are so necessary. It\u2019s the most important thing in my opinion. All these people have to go back. Alright?\u201d Sara Gonzales:I also would say, for the record, I think the fact that we have to categorize hate crimes is ridiculous. However, if we\u2019re gonna apply that standard, we should apply it equally. Jaco Booyens:Yeah. Sara Gonzales:Right? And so often, they are so willing to say, oh, if a white male commits a crime, let\u2019s try to find the hate crime there. So it\u2019s, like, alright. If we\u2019ve got hate crimes, then we need to apply that standard equally. Jaco Booyens:Correct. Sara Gonzales:Certainly, this guy admitting to investigators that he wanted to rid the world of Zionists, like, he\u2019s tellin\u2019 on himself there \u2014 Jaco Booyens:[There\u2019s another] short guy with a little mustache that said similar things about the same people. Sara Gonzales:Right. Right. Right. Exactly. Logan Hall:If we\u2019re gonna \u2014 I\u2019m not a big fan of, like, designating things as hate crimes either, but if we\u2019re gonna be classifying them in that way, I think mass immigration is a hate crime against America. Sara Gonzales:Mhmm. Logan Hall:I mean, what? Honestly. Sara Gonzales:Can you think of \u2014 I mean, there are few things more treasonous. Logan Hall:Yeah, after a certain point, when you see how many of these illegals have committed crimes against our people, our civilization, you have to say that \u2014 you\u2019re left with no other conclusion that \u2014 other than the Biden administration and the Democrats brought them in here for this explicit purpose \u2014 Sara Gonzales:Mhmm. Jaco Booyens:Exactly. Logan Hall:\u2014 to wreak havoc on our country, to hurt our people, to damage innocent people, to damage the rule of law, to damage the safety of our country and our communities. There\u2019s just no other explanation other than that. And, you know, obviously, this kind of just seems pretty self-evident because if you\u2019re going to import a bunch of people who hate you and hate your civilization, millions of them, and then give them free money and also tell them that our country is evil and we\u2019re a terrible people, then what \u2014 like, what could go wrong? I mean, it seems self-evident that they would just do this. Okay? And I think your point was important that they hate us and they hate the Jews. When leftists look at Israel, they don\u2019t really see them as Jewish. They see them as white, which is what \u2014 Jaco Booyens:Correct. Logan Hall:\u2014 which is what \u2014 Jaco Booyens:Correct. Logan Hall:\u2014 all of the Left \u2014 which is what the Left is determined to destroy the most. They really, really hate Western civilization. They say it. It\u2019s their basic stated goal. I think this should not really concern us. I don\u2019t know why we\u2019re importing all these people with ethnic blood feuds halfway across the world. Doesn\u2019t make sense. My sole concern \u2014 and you say, like, oh, well, they brought them in here unvetted. Well even our vetting processes \u2014 Sara Gonzales:You\u2019re \u2014 no, you\u2019re right. Logan Hall:\u2014 are terrible. Sara Gonzales:No you\u2019re right. You\u2019re right. Yes. Logan Hall:Like, so, why even bring them here in the first place? Sara Gonzales:Yeah. Logan Hall:It doesn\u2019t make sense. It doesn\u2019t seem like a \u2014 Sara Gonzales:Well, so Trump\u2019s Muslim ban I supported the entire time. Logan Hall:Oh yeah. Sara Gonzales:I mean, you\u2019ve got these people from these countries that overwhelmingly hate Western civilization. Logan Hall:Yeah. Sara Gonzales:We don\u2019t need to be bringing them here at all. Logan Hall:Yes, and you have to \u2014 at a certain point, you know, our modern ideology, which is like, oh, America is just an idea, and we bring these people and hand them pieces of paper, and they can magically be as American as you or me whose ancestors have been here for 300 years. No. At a certain point, we\u2019re gonna have to say some people just are not compatible with our civilization, okay? And this is why mass deportations are so necessary. It\u2019s the most important thing in my opinion. All these people have to go back. Alright? You\u2019re not gonna have people firebombing \u2014 and, you know, I\u2019m not \u2014 I don\u2019t think any \u2014 I don\u2019t think really any of the foreign \u2014 you know, I think it was a terrible thing, those people were peaceful, but none of this really concerns us at the end of the day. They\u2019re not out there rallying for America or whatever. Like, this should not be our problem, alright? Sara Gonzales:Yeah. I mean, it is \u2014 at the end of the day, like, you can say \u2014 and I\u2019ve said this, and I would love to know, Jaco, from your opinion, \u2019cause you\u2019re a little bit closer to what\u2019s happening in Israel. At the end of the day, I can say I obviously support their right to exist. Jaco Booyens:Yeah. Of course. Sara Gonzales:I think that what is happening to them is terrible, but America has enough problems right now that I don\u2019t necessarily think that that needs to be a priority for this country. However, people can gather and demonstrate for whatever the hell they want to, and they shouldn\u2019t be \u2014 have to do that and be threatened with death because some freaking terrorist came into this country under the Biden regime. **Share this:** Click to share on X (Opens in new window)X Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Facebook Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Tumblr Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)Reddit **Related** **Post navigation** **Top Posts & Pages** Mark Fitzpatrick Promotes Anti-LGBTQ Event On White Supremacist Podcast Joel Webbon: 'The Average Gay Man Has 500 Plus Partners' Traditionalist Catholic Priest Calls The Holocaust 'The Biggest Lie In History' Recommended Reading Cucktionary Wesley Todd: In A 'Christian Nation' There Will Be 'No More Mosques, No More Synagogues' About New York Young Republican Leader Has Ties To Far-Right Extremists Jake Shields: Adolf Hitler 'Wasn't Pushing Hatred Towards Other Races' Longtime White Nationalist Podcaster 'Borzoi Boskovic' Unmasked **Categories** **Blogroll** Africa is a Country Anonymous Comrades Collective Gizmodo Hatewatch | Southern Poverty Law Center HuffPost Politics Jezebel Media Matters ProPublica Rewire.News Right Wing Watch Salon Talking Points Memo The Baffler The Barbed Wire The Handbasket The Nation The New Republic The Present Age The Turtle Diaries them.
