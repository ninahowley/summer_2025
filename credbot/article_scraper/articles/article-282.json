Venkatesa, a formerTop Chefcompetitor and winner of many challenges on the Bravo show, said she loves sharing her south Indian roots and the foods her grandmother, Mythily Ramachandran, taught her to make. \u201cMy grandmother was my biggest inspiration. She would share the love for her family through her food,\u201d Venkatesa said. But she also thanks her parents. \u201cMy parents have also inspired me. If it wasn\u2019t for them I wouldn\u2019t be doing what I love,\u201d she said, crediting them with providing the best education and encouraging her to choose the career path she loved. \u201cWhat I love about it first and foremost is I get to share my story,\u201d including the \u201crich\u201d history of India, the people of India, it\u2019s food, she said.
