Liudmila Chernetska / Getty Images In a new study, theMIND dietwas linked to alower risk of Alzheimer\u2019s and dementia, even when adopted later in life. Foods in the MIND diet maylower inflammationandsupport brain healthas you age. Experts say it\u2019snever too lateto eat more brain-friendly foods likeleafy greens, berries, and fish. A new study found a link between following the MIND diet and a significantly lower risk of dementia, including Alzheimer\u2019s disease\u2014even when the eating plan is adopted later in life. The new research, presented last week at the annual meeting of the American Society for Nutrition, specifically found that adopting the diet\u2014which focuses on foods such as leafy greens and fatty fish like salmon\u2014may reduce the chances ofdementiaby 25%. \u201cResults of this large-scale longitudinal study are consistent with previous research showing that adherence to the MIND diet reduces risk for developingAlzheimer\u2019s disease,\u201dGary Small, MD, a geriatric psychiatrist, chair of psychiatry at Hackensack University Medical Center, and author of multiple books on cognitive health and aging, toldHealth. \u201cThe large sample size and long study duration make these findings particularly compelling.\u201d **What Is the MIND Diet?** The MIND diet isa fusion of two highly regarded diets: The Mediterranean diet.This eating plan doesn\u2019t have one strict formula but is based on the generalized eating habits of people living in the countries along the Mediterranean Sea. It\u2019s heavy on plant-based foods, including many fruits and vegetables, nuts, legumes, whole grains, and healthy fats, with small amounts of eggs, low-fat dairy, fish, and other lean proteins. It limits butter and othersaturated fats, added sugar, refined grains, and overly processed foods. Research has found that the Mediterranean diet may help you live longer, reduce inflammation in your body, lower the risk of heart disease and some cancers, and improve mental health. The DASH diet. While this diet focuses on mostly the same foods as the Mediterranean diet, it places a greater emphasis on limitingsodiumand saturated fats to lower blood pressure and boost cardiovascular health. The MIND diet \u201cis similar in many ways to the Mediterranean and DASH diets, butit emphasizes specific nutrients found in foods like dark leafy greens, berries, and nuts that we know are essential for brain healthandreducing risk of Alzheimer\u2019s diseaseand dementia,\u201dJulie Andrews, RDN, a registered dietitian, chef, and author of cookbooks about the MIND and DASH diets, toldHealth. Other brain-boosting foods incorporated into the diet are fatty fish like salmon and healthy fats (primarily olive oil). **What Did the Study Find?** Researchers gathered and analyzed data from 92,849 people involved in the University of Hawaii\u2019s Multiethnic Cohort Study. At the study\u2019s start, participants were between the ages of 45 and 75 and represented five racial and ethnic groups: African-American, Latino, White, Japanese-American, and Native Hawaiian. Ten years after participants completed a food-frequency questionnaire, researchers followed up with them to assess how closely they adhered to the MIND diet. People whofollowed the MIND diet most closely had a 9% lower risk of developing Alzheimer\u2019sdisease and related dementias compared to those who stuck to the eating plan the least. Those whoimproved their MIND diet score the most over 10 years, even if they didn\u2019t follow the diet at first, had a 25% lower risk of developing dementiathan those whose diet scores got worse. \u201cThis suggests that it is never too late to adopt a healthy diet to prevent dementia,\u201d saidSong-Yi Park, PhD, the study\u2019s first author and an associate professor at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, in a press release. **Were Results the Same Across Racial Groups?** Researchers found an association between the MIND diet and lower dementia risk in racial and ethnic groups except Native Hawaiians, who saw no benefit regardless of age. Of the groups that did seem to benefit, the connection was weakest for Japanese-Americans. The reasons for this aren\u2019t obvious, saidBrendan Kelley, MD, a neurologist and dementia expert at the Peter J. O\u2019Donnell Jr. Brain Institute at the University of Texas Southwestern. \u201cIt is not clear why, and this study is not structured to be able to answer this question,\u201d he toldHealth. However, the study\u2019s authors noted the possibility that Asian Americans experience lower rates of dementia compared to the other racial and ethnic groups included in the study. That could make it more difficult to demonstrate statistically significant differences in dementia rates, Small said. **What Were the Study\u2019s Limitations?** Theresearch hasn\u2019t yet been peer-reviewedand shows only a correlation between the MIND diet and a lower dementia risk\u2014itdoesn\u2019t prove causation. \u201cPeople who are more conscientious in adherence to a healthy diet also would be more likely to engage in other healthy lifestyle behaviors, such as regular physical exercise, social engagement, and mental stimulation, all of which may have contributed to the lowered risk for the disease,\u201d Small said. Additionally, \u201cthe study relies on information that was reported by participants and on diagnoses that were assigned in clinical settings. The researchers did not directly evaluate the people participating in the study, and so the accuracy of the diagnosis or diet is not known,\u201d Kelley said. However, thisisn\u2019t the firststudy to find a link between the MIND diet and lower chances of dementia. Previous research has also shown that the diet may slow brain aging by up to 7.5 years and could lead to other improvements in various aspects of aging, including grip strength, mobility, and \u201cinflammaging,\u201d a term forchronic low-grade inflammation. **Should You Try the MIND Diet For a Brain Boost?** Small, Andrews, and Kelley areproponents of this eating plan. \u201cIt\u2019s never too early or too late to change your dietary and lifestyle habits to protect your brain,\u201d Small said. To get started, Andrews recommended: Swapping out refined grains, such as white bread, forwhole grains Adding in a few weekly servings of dark leafy greens Snacking on ahandful of roasted nutsevery week Making a weekly frozen berry smoothie Adhering to the MIND diet can be pricey, however. For budget-friendly ways to implement the eating plan, Andrews suggested: Usingfrozen vegetablesinstead of fresh Addingcanned beansto casseroles, soups, salads, and bowls Opting for canned salmon and tuna, which you can mix into salads, pasta dishes, and fish burgers News Park SY, Setiawan VW, Crimmins E, et al.The MIND diet and incidence of Alzheimer\u2019s disease and related dementias among five racial and ethnic groups in the multiethnic cohort study.Curr Dev Nutr. 2025;9:106493. doi:10.1016/j.cdnut.2025.106493 Park SY, Setiawan VW, Crimmins E, et al.The MIND diet and incidence of Alzheimer\u2019s disease and related dementias among five racial and ethnic groups in the multiethnic cohort study.Curr Dev Nutr. 2025;9:106493. doi:10.1016/j.cdnut.2025.106493 Park SY, Setiawan VW, Crimmins E, et al.The MIND diet and incidence of Alzheimer\u2019s disease and related dementias among five racial and ethnic groups in the multiethnic cohort study.Curr Dev Nutr. 2025;9:106493. doi:10.1016/j.cdnut.2025.106493 Liu X, Morris MC, Dhana K, et al.Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) study: rationale, design and baseline characteristics of a randomized control trial of the MIND diet on cognitive decline.Contemp Clin Trials. 2021;102:106270. doi:10.1016/j.cct.2021.106270 Liu X, Morris MC, Dhana K, et al.Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) study: rationale, design and baseline characteristics of a randomized control trial of the MIND diet on cognitive decline.Contemp Clin Trials. 2021;102:106270. doi:10.1016/j.cct.2021.106270 Liu X, Morris MC, Dhana K, et al.Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) study: rationale, design and baseline characteristics of a randomized control trial of the MIND diet on cognitive decline.Contemp Clin Trials. 2021;102:106270. doi:10.1016/j.cct.2021.106270 Tosti V, Bertozzi B, Fontana L.Health benefits of the Mediterranean Diet: metabolic and molecular mechanisms.J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci. 2018;73(3):318-326. doi:10.1093/gerona/glx227 Tosti V, Bertozzi B, Fontana L.Health benefits of the Mediterranean Diet: metabolic and molecular mechanisms.J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci. 2018;73(3):318-326. doi:10.1093/gerona/glx227 Tosti V, Bertozzi B, Fontana L.Health benefits of the Mediterranean Diet: metabolic and molecular mechanisms.J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci. 2018;73(3):318-326. doi:10.1093/gerona/glx227 American Heart Association.What is the Mediterranean Diet?.
