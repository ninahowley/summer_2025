It\u2019s a long letter with a lot of gratitude, but these are the most eye-catching details: #4)Letters: \u201cI spent each day between the same four walls of my unit, where I receive both holiday cards sent in December and birthday cards sent between March and May, creating a bizarre and disorienting Groundhog Day scenario where every day is both Christmas and my May 6 birthday,\u201d he wrote. \u201cNonetheless, I\u2019m incredibly grateful.\u201d #6)Memes: \u201cAs one of my wisest correspondents put it: \u2018Laughter is louder than logic and makes a lot more sense.\u2019\u201d #8) Independent media/creators: \u201cPublications like The American Prospect,\u201d citizen documentarians like Jooni Kim, and citizen journalists (of which there are too many to name).\u201d #13)Funding: \u201cThe some 30,000 individuals around the globe who have come together to donate over $1,000,000 to mylegalfund.\u201d #16) \u201cLatinas for Mangione.\u201d #23) The conservatives, \u201cwho fiercely conserve the aspects of our society that make us great.\u201d #24) The liberals, \u201cwho liberate us from the outdated aspects of our society that prevent us from being greater.\u201d You can read thefull letter at TMZ. **The Latinas are hyped** Out of all 27 gratitude items, the clear favorite among social media users is number 16, \u201cLatinas for Mangione.\u201d This most likely refers to the Instagram account@latinasformangione.
