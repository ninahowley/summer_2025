ByAnna Rumer Click to share on X (Opens in new window)X Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Facebook Larsa Pippen had a \u201creally tough\u201d time on the upcoming season ofThe Real Housewives of Miamiin the aftermath of hersplit from Marcus Jordan. Ahead of Wednesday\u2019s premiere ofSeason 7 of the Bravo show, Larsa teased the \u201cemotional\u201d episodes ofRHOMto come in an interview with PopCulture.com while revealing how she found true love with new boyfriend Jeff Coby \u2014 and how you might also find love with the help of her new dating app. **Videos by PopCulture.com** \u201cI feel like this season is hard because I\u2019m really emotional,\u201d Larsa told PopCulture ofRHOMSeason 7. \u201cIt\u2019s hard goingthrough a breakup publicly. I think it was just [that] I\u2019ve never had to be in the situation before.\u201d When Larsa and her ex-husband,NBA legend Scottie Pippen, filed for divorce in October 2016, the Olujo tequila founder said it was a relatively \u201cquiet\u201d split. \u201cYou know, people assumed all kinds of things, but it was quiet,\u201d she explained. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t necessarily so out there.\u201d Being so open about her split from Jordan on camera, however, was more difficult. \u201cIt was really tough to be so open with my emotions and share all that,\u201d she confessed. \u201cBecause I feel like, for me, in the past, I only want to talk about the good things. I\u2019m not one of those people that wants to share my darkest moments.\u201d She continued, \u201cI just feel like that sometimes it\u2019s heavy if you\u2019re constantly telling people negative things, and it just weighs on everyone. I\u2019m not like that. But I feel like this season, it was hard. I cried a lot.\u201d Larsa may have been on a dating \u201cdetox\u201d during Season 7 ofRHOM, but it wasn\u2019t long before she ran into her current beau at a party. \u201cI feel like we just have so much in common,\u201d Larsa said of Coby. \u201cI think this is the first relationship that I\u2019ve had where it\u2019s so normal. You know, I don\u2019t feel like we have to go out all the time. I don\u2019t think we have to be in the public eye. You know, we just do very normal things. We cook together, we work out together, we go to bed early together, we watch shows together. We just do normal things. And I feel like maybe that\u2019s what I needed all along \u2014 a very normal relationship.\u201d When it comes to possibly taking the next step in their relationship, Larsa noted, \u201cI really enjoyed being married. I think that marriage is really nice, and it\u2019s something that I definitely want to go back into. So yeah, definitely, I would get married again.\u201d As Larsa enjoys the loved-up life, she wants to help singles all over find connection as the co-founder ofDate.com. The AI-powered dating app makes meeting men \u201cso easy,\u201d Larsa said, and helps make online dating more privacy- and safety-conscious with features like in-app calling, a date concierge service, and anti-catfishing measures, which include profile photos that have to be taken within the app. \u201cIt\u2019s just an amazing app that makes dating easy, fun, [and] safe,\u201d Larsa told PopCulture, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s just a smart way of dating, I think, in 2025.\u201d The Real Housewives of Miamireturn for Season 7 on June 11 at 9 p.m. ET on Bravo. **Next Article** \u20181000-lb Sisters\u2019 Star Tammy Slaton Reveals Jaw-Dropping Results of Her Skin Removal Surgery\u2192 **\u20181000-lb Sisters\u2019 Star Tammy Slaton Reveals Jaw-Dropping Results of Her Skin Removal Surgery** **\u20181000-lb Sisters\u2019 Star Tammy Slaton Reveals Jaw-Dropping Results of Her Skin Removal Surgery** **More Reality** \u2018Love & Hip Hop Atlanta\u2019 Season 13 Trailer Revealed **\u2018Love & Hip Hop Atlanta\u2019 Season 13 Trailer Revealed** **\u2018Love & Hip Hop Atlanta\u2019 Season 13 Trailer Revealed** Meet All 5 Couples From \u2018Married at First Sight\u2019 Season 17 **Meet All 5 Couples From \u2018Married at First Sight\u2019 Season 17** **Meet All 5 Couples From \u2018Married at First Sight\u2019 Season 17** Netflix Couple Expecting Their First Baby **Netflix Couple Expecting Their First Baby** **Netflix Couple Expecting Their First Baby** \u2018Dancing With the Stars\u2019 Couple Sparks Breakup Rumors **\u2018Dancing With the Stars\u2019 Couple Sparks Breakup Rumors** **\u2018Dancing With the Stars\u2019 Couple Sparks Breakup Rumors** Tarek El Moussa Cited for Battery Following Alleged Altercation **Tarek El Moussa Cited for Battery Following Alleged Altercation** **Tarek El Moussa Cited for Battery Following Alleged Altercation** **Your inbox just got relevant** Sign up to get the latest pop culture scoop and celebrity news.
