\ud83d\udcb8 Tax Accountant **Thousands of travellers are claiming money back following NS strikes (and it\u2019s so Dutch)** This is going to be expensive If there\u2019s one thing you can be certain about in the Netherlands, it\u2019s that if anyone is inconvenienced by a train issue, refund requests are going to be made.\ud83d\udcb0 And with strikes essentially shutting down trains across the country yesterday and last Friday, the NS is feeling the burn. In a move that is typically Dutch, tens of thousands of people across the country are sticking out a hand and demanding compensation. **Ok, so\u2026 how can I make a claim?** You may not be Dutch, but you\u2019re certainly trying to integrate, right? Here\u2019s what we know about how to make a claim: If you were unable to take a train due to the strike and instead had to travel by car, bus, or taxi, then you are eligible to make a claim usingthis form. (Just know that you can only receive a maximum of \u20ac25 back. \ud83d\udc40\ud83d\udcb8) However, that\u2019s not all, because you can also ask for a refund on your ticket if you\u2019ve already paid for one. Was your delay longer than 60 minutes? We\u2019re going to say yes, given there was a nationwide strike. In this case, you can get your ticket refunded using theGeld Terug bij Vertraging(money back for delays) scheme. **Thousands of claims, thousands in euros** Speaking withRTL Nieuws, a spokesperson for the NS has confirmed that the company has indeed received thousands of declarations so far. Right now, with refund requests still flowing in, the company can\u2019t give any concrete numbers; however, they do share a foreboding message: \u201cPeople can submit the claims on the strike days, and there may be more strikes coming.\u201d Yikes. Keep those refund links handy and perhaps look into carpool options.
