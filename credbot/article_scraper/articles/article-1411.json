Artyom Kriger, Antonina Favorskaya, Konstantin Gabov and Sergei Karelin were found guilty of \"participating in an extremist group\" after a trial carried out behind closed doors. All four deny their guilt. Video journalists Gabov and Karelin had worked for a variety of outlets including major international agencies \u2014 Gabov with Reuters and Karelin with the Associated Press. In his courtroom speech, Karelin said he shot footage for Popular Politics, a YouTube channel launched by Navalny\u2019s allies that he agreed to work for after a lawyer told him it \u201chad not been designated as extremist or a foreign agent.\u201d The Moscow Times previouslypublishedKriger\u2019s final word in court. Favorskaya\u2019s letter containing her speech was blocked by prison censors. We are nowpublishingGabov and Karelin\u2019s courtroom speeches. Statements have been edited for length and clarity. **Sergei Karelin\u2019s court argument** I have worked in television since 2004, and I spent my first eight years in the industry as a sound engineer at NTV Channel. During that time, I traveled to many countries as part of the presidential press pool, and I felt a growing desire to tell stories about my country, to document what was happening here. I later worked for several years at the 360 TV channel as a cameraman. I hold a professional degree from the State Institute of Television and Radio, with a diploma in film and television camerawork, as well as in teaching. I\u2019ve always wanted to make documentaries and tell stories about life in my country \u2014 a country I deeply love. But since this is quite a challenging pursuit, especially financially, I continued to work at TV channels to support myself. Since 2017, I\u2019ve been accredited by the Russian Foreign Ministry and worked as a cameraman for internationally respected Western media outlets and news agencies. \u2026 In 2022, my life changed dramatically. Early that year, the company where I had worked for the previous five years ceased operations in Russia. I lost another client due to budget cuts. In February, [the war] began. It affected the lives of everyone in our country \u2014 and beyond. Many Russian citizens emigrated. And in March, I became the father of a wonderful daughter, Miroslava. We could have left too \u2014 I have a second citizenship \u2014 but my family is here, my friends are here, the ones now standing in the hallway. My grandfather turned 101 in November. I love my country, Moscow, our village in the Pskov region, nature and my work \u2014 here! This is my home. My wife went on maternity leave and my financial responsibilities grew significantly. At the same time, it became increasingly difficult to find steady, well-paid work, so I had to take on almost any filming job I could find. Still, as a professional, it was important for me to preserve my dignity as a journalist \u2014 to maintain respect for my subjects and for storytelling, and to uphold journalistic ethics. Around that time, I was offered a job filming street interviews for the YouTube channel Popular Politics. I consulted with a lawyer \u2014 the media outlet was not [officially] designated as extremist or a foreign agent \u2014 and so I agreed to take on the assignment. Given my desire to tell stories about life in my country, I was genuinely interested in hearing people\u2019s unfiltered opinions. Street interviews are a standard journalistic method and I\u2019ve filmed them for various editorial teams. I want to stress that even then, it was important for me to do the job honestly \u2014 to engage with all points of view and to film people from a range of backgrounds and beliefs. I also filmed public events for different outlets \u2014 from concerts to mass rallies. At the rallies, I was there strictly as a cameraman working under editorial direction. \u2026 Everything I\u2019ve described comes down to one thing: I love my country and my family \u2014 that\u2019s all. Despite having a second citizenship, I never wanted to leave. I wanted to raise my daughter here, in our beautiful country. I want this to be a country where people are not persecuted for their views or positions, where they aren\u2019t labeled a \u2018fifth column\u2019 or turned into targets for others. I stand for freedom of expression, for people\u2019s right to speak freely, and for the media\u2019s right to show Russia \u2014 and the world \u2014 what\u2019s happening. I dream of a future in which journalists can work freely, without censorship or pressure. I want to see a strong civil society in this country \u2014 and for the rights of its people to be respected. **Russia Sentences Journalists to 5.5 Years in Navalny 'Extremism' Case** **Russia Sentences Journalists to 5.5 Years in Navalny 'Extremism' Case** **Sergei Karelin\u2019s last word** I am in prison for my professional activity, for my honest and impartial approach to journalism, and for my love of my family and my country. Since I\u2019ve already spoken about my work in the courtroom, I now want to say something else \u2014 something personal. I\u2019d like to try to address the most important person in my life \u2014 my daughter Mira, whom I haven\u2019t seen in 11 months. And I don\u2019t know when I will. You understand, of course, that if I\u2019m convicted, my whole family will suffer \u2014 my 101-year-old grandfather, a war veteran, my elderly parents who are doing their best to hang in there, and most of all \u2014 my beautiful daughter. I never imagined my child would become a victim of political repression \u2014 just like the children of those persecuted in the 1930s. Can you imagine such a fate for your own children? So yes, I\u2019m now a \u2018dad on a business trip,\u2019 like many others today \u2014 just like so many were back then. I don\u2019t know when I\u2019ll see her again, let alone hold her in my arms. **Konstantin Gabov\u2019s last word** Today I am being tried for my professional activity. All my life, working as a journalist at a number of media outlets, I have acted in strict accordance with the Russian Constitution. Article 29 guarantees freedom of thought and speech. Everyone has the right to freely seek, receive, transmit, produce and distribute information by any legal means. Freedom of the mass media is guaranteed. Censorship is prohibited. I have never been a member of any political party. I have always believed that a journalist's duty is to objectively reflect the opinions of people with different views, helping them to be heard by those in power. As early as last spring, I was producing reports about trials of activists \u2014 earlier, on the closure of [Nobel Peace Prize-winning human rights group] Memorial, the closure of the Sakharov Center and the dismantling of the Moscow Helsinki Group. Federal Security Service officers ran background checks on my employment history \u2014 from a local TV station in the city of Syktyvkar to major international media like Reuters. For some reason, a payment from the German company Deutsche Welle in May 2024 was cited by [state watchdog] Rosfinmonitoring when I was added to the register of \u2018extremists and terrorists.\u2019 Meanwhile, my work for [U.S.-funded media outlets] Current Time and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty became part of this case. Out of the five episodes used as evidence in my case, only one has witnesses. The participants confirm that I conducted the interview. The video was published on the NavalnyLIVE YouTube channel on January 23, 2024, under the title: \u2018If you were face to face with Putin, what would you say?\u2019 The investigators from the Russian Investigative Committee\u2019s Main Investigation Department did not establish any correspondence between me and [Navalny\u2019s Anti-Corruption Foundation] members, nor did they find evidence that I had received assignments or money from them, subscribed to their channels, reposted or liked their content. I\u2019d like to stress that I have never had any administrative offenses in my life. Now I\u2019m being charged under one of the most serious articles in the Russian Criminal Code, under the section \u2018Crimes Against the Constitutional Order\u2019: \u2018Participation in an extremist organization.\u2019 As someone with a background in cultural studies, I am fully aware of the country I live in. Throughout its history, Russia has remained the same \u2014 there\u2019s nothing new in the current situation. Russia has always had a talent for creating problems not only for its own people, but also for neighboring countries. Independent journalism is now equated with extremism. Such rigidity is a result of a polarized society. \u2026 Even behind bars, I believe that the problems and developments in Russia must be reported on from inside the country. Working under such extreme conditions is hard, but possible. And, most importantly \u2014 necessary. \u2026 My work has always been about giving voice to those who cannot be heard, and covering events that are crucial for society. I believe that journalism is not a crime \u2014 it is an essential part of a democratic society. We must remember that every voice matters, and only together can we change things for the better. I hope that one day we will live in a country where freedom of speech is not just a right, but an integral part of everyone\u2019s life.
