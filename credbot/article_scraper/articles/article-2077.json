Amid Curfews and Looting Concerns Following Devastating Fires** January 10, 2025OFFGRID SurvivalOFFGRID Survival News,Social Unrest0 Los Angeles is a mess right now. Afterdevastating wildfiresripped through the area, it\u2019s not just the flames causing chaos\u2014it\u2019s people. Looters are hitting evacuation zones hard, and with tensions boiling over, the National Guard has been called in to clean things up. If this doesn\u2019t scream \u201cyou\u2019re on your own,\u201d I don\u2019t know what does. **Looters Are Taking Advantage\u2014Don\u2019t Let Them Take Advantage of You** Over 20 arrests have already been made as scumbags have been using the chaos to prey on fire victims. L.A. County Sheriff Robert Luna says the National Guard\u2019s arrival should send a clear message:stay out of these neighborhoods or face the consequences.Curfews are in place from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m., but let\u2019s be real\u2014curfews only work if people follow them. National Guard troops arrived in California on Friday to assist in restoring order as \u201cdespicable\u201d looting disrupted some areas, resulting in at least 20 arrests and prompting a strict overnight curfew. The guardsmen were spotted patrolling streets and providing aid to residents in neighborhoods impacted by the devastating fires, now considered the most destructive in Los Angeles history. \u201cThe Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department has officially requested the support of the California National Guard for both fires,\u201d said LA County Sheriff Robert Luna. \u201cThey will be assisting us with traffic control and critical infrastructure protection.\u201d Los Angeles woman says 'hundreds' of thieves are looting luxury homes that were evacuated due to firesShe says the police are nowhere in sightpic.twitter.com/mV1cZy2Mw0 You can\u2019t rely on the Guard or the cops to keep your stuff safe. If you live in a disaster-prone area, you\u2019d better have your home locked down and ready to defend. Alarms, cameras, reinforced doors, and yes, something for personal protection, are your best bets. **False Alerts Add to the Chaos** As if things weren\u2019t bad enough, the emergency alert system is screwing up left and right. People in areas miles away from the fires got evacuation warnings\u2014turns out it was a \u201ctechnical glitch.\u201d Great. Just what we need, more confusion. Reporter: Millions of people in Los Angeles are getting many bogus fire evacuation alerts and are now ignoring them.We still are under Red Flag warnings.There is a real threat here.What are you doing?Mayor Bass: I want the residents to have faith in what we are doing 24/7pic.twitter.com/2r9H9hjEEQ Here\u2019s the takeaway: don\u2019t trust the system to get it right. You need your own plan. Whether that\u2019s a ham radio, a CB, or just knowing what\u2019s going on in your neighborhood, you\u2019ve got to stay informed without relying on government screwups. **Water System Fails\u2014What a Surprise** Then there\u2019s the water problem. While homes and hills were burning, firefighters were stuck dealing with low water pressure because the Santa Ynez Reservoir was offline for repairs. Yeah, you read that right\u2014offlineduring a major wildfire.This kind of failure isn\u2019t just stupid; it\u2019s deadly. Los Angeles refused to fill the water reservoirs and now there\u2019s no water in the fire hydrants to fight the fires.People are fleeing for their lives while watching their homes & businesses burn to the ground.This is incompetence at the highest level.pic.twitter.com/boN1BHI34D A fire captain in Los Angeles is asked how many fire hydrants have water. His answer:\u201cLittle to none.\u201dWelcome to the Third World.pic.twitter.com/17cjE1ANRq If this doesn\u2019t make you want to stockpile water and prep your own filtration systems, I don\u2019t know what will. You need to be ready to live without utilities because history proves they\u2019ll fail when you need them most. It also shows the need for a solid Bug Out Plan! **The Bottom Line: Government Will Let You Down** This whole situation is another reminder of a hard truth:help isn\u2019t coming.From looters to bad emergency alerts to water failures, the cracks in the system are everywhere. Sure, the National Guard showing up is something, but by the time they roll in, the damage is done. The unfolding disaster underscores a recurring theme:government systems FAIL in times of crisis. From water shortages to mismanaged emergency alerts, many residents feel let down and are questioning the state\u2019s ability to protect its citizens during emergencies. Former President Trump weighed in, blasting state and federal leadership on Truth Social, saying, \u201cNO WATER IN THE FIRE HYDRANTS, NO MONEY IN FEMA. THIS IS WHAT JOE BIDEN IS LEAVING ME. THANKS JOE!\u201d These issues highlight why individuals need to prioritize personal preparedness. As we\u2019ve previously discussed inThe Aftermath: Preparing for Post-Disaster Problems, survival depends on planning for extended periods without utilities, access to food, or even safety from looters. For those watching the chaos, now is the time to assess your preparedness for future disasters. Whether it\u2019s stocking up on emergency food and water, securing your home against potential looters, or understanding your rights in the face of government-imposed curfews, being self-reliant is not just wise\u2014it\u2019s essential. Prepping for a disaster is only half the battle\u2014what happensaftercan be even more dangerous. Here\u2019s what you need to know: **1. Living Without Utilities** Expect extended outages.Power, water, and gas could be out for weeks or even months. Stockpile water.Have at least two weeks\u2019 worth of drinking water, more if possible. Plan for sanitation.Without sewer systems, sanitation becomes critical\u2014improper waste management can kill more people than the disaster itself. Have off-grid cooking options.Without electricity or gas, you\u2019ll need ways to prepare food. Get geared up.Consider solar generators and water filtration systems. **2. Grocery Store Shutdowns** Stock up on food.Grocery stores will empty out fast, and restocking can take weeks or months. Learn food security.Hunting, fishing, foraging, and gardening are vital skills. Survival garden.Even a small one can provide much-needed resources. **3. Post-Disaster Violence** Social unrest will happen.Riots, looting, and home invasions are almost guaranteed, especially in urban areas. Be ready to defend yourself.Learn self-defense and consider owning a firearm. Fortify your home.Make it harder for criminals to break in. Prepare for desperate neighbors.Even \u201cnormal\u201d people can become a threat when they\u2019re desperate. **4. Government Threats** Don\u2019t rely on officials.Many government actions, like evacuation orders or martial law, make things worse. Be cautious of crackdowns.Expect curfews, travel restrictions, and even gun confiscations. Act early.Don\u2019t wait for government orders to leave or prepare. **The Truth Hurts\u2014But It Saves Lives** Disasters like this show how unprepared most people are. If you don\u2019t want to end up as another victim waiting for someone to save you, get your act together now. Start with the basics and build from there. **Leave a ReplyCancel reply** Your email address will not be published.
