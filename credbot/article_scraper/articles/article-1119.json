P -J photos by Gregory BaconSTOCKTON \u2013 Arlene Tariq was the daughter of a single mother with no financial support. She started working at 16 years old to help support the household, but as her grades slipped, she dropped out of City Tech in Brooklyn. Today she is a licensed master social worker and earns $75 an hour. Tariq shared her story as a testimony of what Job Corps has done in her life. \u201cI felt like I was falling through the cracks. I needed a change,\u201d Tariq said to a room full of people at the Stockton Fire Hall, four miles away from the place where she found her purpose and passion in life. Tariq attended the Cassadaga Job Corps in 2016, graduated, and earned her certifications to be a certified nursing assistant and home health aide. She was later able to attend Jamestown Community College, State University at Fredonia and eventually got her masters degree from the University of Buffalo. She is now an adolescent and adult psychotherapist in Amherst. \u201cI help adolescents who, like me, need someone to believe in them and a system that won\u2019t give up on them,\u201d Tariq said. As a former student, Tariq is calling on Job Corps to remain in place and continue helping teenagers and young adults from disadvantaged backgrounds to obtain high school diplomas or an equivalent, vocational certificates and licenses and on-the-job training. On May 29, the U.S. Department of Labor announced that it was \u201cpausing Job Corps Center operations at contractor-operated Job Corps centers nationwide.\u201d The Cassadaga Job Corps is one of 99 non-federally operated Job Corps centers. Last week, a federal judge issued a temporary restraining order that the government not terminate Job Corps contractors or stop work at Job Corps centers until a further ruling in the case. When the Labor Department initially announced the end of the program, one of the reasons it cited was a low graduation rate, saying less than 40% were getting their GED and a certificate in a training program. Jake Brock, the president of Job Corps\u2019 Union called \u201cGuardians of the Hill,\u201d said he doesn\u2019t know if that national number is accurate, but he said that\u2019s not the case locally. \u201cIn Cassadaga, we have almost a 90% completion rate and a 90% placement rate with students after they finish our program,\u201d he said in an interview. When Brock spoke during the rally, he noted that Job Corps also helps society as a whole. \u201cThese centers don\u2019t just shape individual futures. They strengthen entire communities. In places like Cassadaga and throughout the surrounding regions, Job Corps provides the skilled motivated workers that the local businesses depend on. It drives economic growth, stability, and hope, not just for the students, but for the towns that grow with them,\u201d he said. According to Brock, the Cassadaga Job Corps had about 165 students before the pause was issued. Job Corps was in the process of sending students home before the temporary retaining order was issued. Now they have about 130 students on the campus on Glasgow Road in the town of Pomfret. Between full- and part-time staff, Brock said they have 117 positions, although some of those positions are vacant. Triston Vera said when he was younger he was essentially homeless, \u201ccouch-surfing\u201d from various friends\u2019 homes, as his mother struggled with addiction. Today he works for Absolut Care in Westfield. \u201cJob Corps was my lifeline. Without it, life would look very different, and not in a good way,\u201d he said. Stephen Storey was living in Dunkirk with his grandmother, but applied to live at Job Corps. \u201cI chose to live on campus in Cassadaga because I wanted more than a skill. I wanted structure, support and a fresh start and that\u2019s exactly what I got,\u201d he said. Today Storey has a job where he interprets architectural and engineering drawings. \u201cA Job Corps doesn\u2019t just train, it launches careers,\u201d he said. Margie Andrews, a reading specialist for Job Corps, noted that Job Corps not only educates and trains students in various trades, they teach them life skills, how to manage money, help them obtain a driver\u2019s license and give them hope for a future. \u201cJob Corps isn\u2019t just changing lives, it\u2019s proving what\u2019s possible,\u201d she said. Eric Pasquale, the purchasing agent for Job Corps, called on Rep. Nick Langworthy, who was not in attendance, to \u201clisten to his constituents, meet with our students and staff, and fight for the Job Corps program.\u201d Audience members were encouraged to go to change.org and search \u201cSave Cassadaga Job Corps\u201d to sign the petition, as well as to contact their local, state and federal representatives. Brock, the union president, said the next court hearing is set for June 17 between Job Corps and the Labor Department. **Newsletter** **Local News** **Local News** **\u2018Strengthening communities\u2019: Former Students, Staff Rally To Save Job Corps** **\u2018Strengthening communities\u2019: Former Students, Staff Rally To Save Job Corps** **Ribfest Closes Another Run In Celoron** **Ribfest Closes Another Run In Celoron** **Saturday\u2019s Touch A Truck Event Heavily Attended** **Saturday\u2019s Touch A Truck Event Heavily Attended** **Panama Looks To Make Memorial Day Parade Organization Easier In Future** **Panama Looks To Make Memorial Day Parade Organization Easier In Future** **Addressing A New Need** **Addressing A New Need** **Falconer Man Charged Firing Gun At Quality Inn** **Falconer Man Charged Firing Gun At Quality Inn** FALCONER - A Falconer man faces several charges after allegedly firing a gun near the Quality Inn in Falconer on ...
