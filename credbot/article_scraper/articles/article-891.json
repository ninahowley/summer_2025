Recognizing this urgent need for alternative device powering solutions, G-Lyte has perfected their best-in-class, proprietary Dye Sensitized Solar Cell (DSSC) technology to create a durable, high-efficiency power source in low light environments that\u2019s eco-friendly and 99%-plus recyclable. Created as an embedded technology for product integration at the OEM level, G-Lyte is designed to power such products as computer accessories, remote controls, electronic shelf labels (ESLs), smart watches, trackers, sensors and more. Manufactured for integration into both existing and new electronic devices, G-Lyte\u2019s dynamic team of scientist-inventors work with product manufacturers at every level of the engineering process to evaluate their products\u2019 power requirements and the prevailing lighting conditions in which the device will ultimately operate to first determine if the photovoltaic in-dye solution is, in fact, the best approach before deploying standard or custom sized and shaped products to power the device. G-Lyte also offers the only cell efficient in indoor conditions and stable under prolonged direct sun exposure. \u201cThere are three elements that truly set the G-Lyte approach apart from other alternative power solutions,\u201d said company Co-Founder and CEO Franck Barath. \u201cFirst, we require lowest surface area thanks to an efficiency up to three times higher than conventional technologies which unlocks the potential for incorporation into new uses. Second, our in-dye cell has unparalleled lifespan and stability under various conditions; the product has minimal environmental impact with no toxic material used in the cell or the process. A member of both Frenchtech and Greentech. G-Lyte will exhibit at CES from Booth #60415in Venetian Hall G as part of the International Boost delegation of emerging French companies and startups.
