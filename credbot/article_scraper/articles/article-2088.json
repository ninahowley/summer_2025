In a more recent snap captioned \u201c\u2026now,\u201d Robyn and Blake were seen giving soft smiles. She then shared a third image in which Robyn and Blake were holding hands and smiling at each other. \u201cAnd always,\u201d she captioned the photo along with a red heart emoji. \u201cNo one knows you quite like I do, and man am I ever proud of you,\u201d Robyn continued. \u201cI love you sister.\u201d Blake echoed her sister\u2019s loving words with her own message beneath the re-post. \u201cI love you more,\u201d Blake wrote. \u201cAlways. Forever. Near or far. Closer together.\u201d The \u201cSimple Favor\u201d star then included a heart-shaped sticker etched with the words, \u201cI love you so, so hard. Like the most. Ever.\u201d Blake re-shared the images along with Donna Lewis\u2019 1996 song \u201cI Love You Always Forever.\u201d Robyn\u2019s show of support for Blake came a day after a judge granted the motion to dismiss Baldoni\u2019s $400 million countersuit against Blake and husband Ryan Reynolds, along with his $250 millionlibel lawsuit against the New York Times. According to documents obtained by Page Six Monday, Judge Lewis J. Liman wrote that Baldoni and his production company, Wayfarer Studios, \u201chave not alleged that Lively is responsible for any statements other than the statements in her [California Civil Rights Department] complaint, which are privileged.\u201d Baldoni\u2019s complaint, Liman said, \u201calleged that Reynolds and [publicist Leslie] Sloane made additional statements accusing Baldoni of sexual misconduct and that the \u2018Times\u2019 made additional statements accusing the Wayfarer Parties of engaging in a smear campaign.\u201d \u201cThe Wayfarer Parties have not alleged that Reynolds, Sloane or the \u2018Times\u2019 would have seriously doubted these statements were true based on the information available to them, as is required for them to be liable for defamation under applicable law,\u201d he continued. Lively\u2019s team of lawyers from Esra Hudson & Mike Gottlieb called the rulinga \u201ctotal victory and a complete vindication\u201din a statement to Page Six. \u201cAs we have said from day one, this \u2018$400 million\u2019 lawsuit was a sham, and the Court saw right through it,\u201d the statement said. However, Baldoni\u2019s attorneydenied that the latest legal twist was a victory for Blake, telling Page Six in a statement Tuesday that the fight is far from over. \u201cMs. Lively and her team\u2019s predictable declaration of victory is false, so let us be clear about the latest ruling,\u201d the actor\u2019s attorney, Bryan Freedman, said. \u201cWhile the Court dismissed the defamation related claims, the Court has invited us to amend four out of the seven claims against Ms. Lively, which will showcase additional evidence and refined allegations,\u201d he continued. \u201cThis case is about false accusations of sexual harassment and retaliation and a nonexistent smear campaign, which Ms. Lively\u2019s own team conveniently describes as \u2018untraceable\u2019 because they cannot prove what never happened.\u201d Freedman dubbed Lively\u2019s allegations \u201cno truer today than they were yesterday.\u201d \u201cAnd with the facts on our side, we march forward with the same confidence that we had when Ms. Lively and her cohorts initiated this battle and look forward to her forthcoming deposition, which I will be taking,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are grateful for the organic show of support from the public and for the dedication of the Internet sleuth community who continue to cover the case with discernment and integrity.\u201d **Want more celebrity and pop culture news?** Start your day with Page Six Daily. **Thanks for signing up!** Please provide a valid email address.

A source told the Daily Mail Tuesday that Baldoni, 41, was feeling confident, yet he also \u201cfeels this is a huge kick to the guts.\u201d \u201cHe is looking to figure out how to move forward from this current setback,\u201d the source said. Baldoni\u2019s lawyers have until June 23 to amend their claims for breach of implied covenant. Rumors that Blake and Baldoni were feudingsurfaced in August 2024 after their movie, \u201cIt Ends With Us,\u201d premiered in New York City. The film\u2019s director and Blake notably did not pose together and avoided talking about each other while doing press for the film adaptation of Colleen Hoover\u2019s book of the same name. Last December, Livelysued Baldoni for sexual harassment, retaliation, breach of contract, infliction of emotional distress, invasion of privacy and lost wages. Baldoniresponded with a $400 million countersuitaccusing Blake and Reynolds of defamation. He also accused the New York Times (the first outlet to report on Blake\u2019s lawsuit) of libelin a $250 million suit. The \u201cJane The Virgin\u201d alum has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and has accused Blake of commandeering his directorial responsibilities.
