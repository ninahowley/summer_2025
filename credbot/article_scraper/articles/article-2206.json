I checked boxes that I could get into but there are lots of boxes I cannot get to. So, I came home and ordered a new one from Amazon. It will be here today. It will be needed soon. And since it is Florida, we have lots of storms. It is the fireworks I dread. And I am guessing that there will be a lot of fireworks on this street. Lots of kids and people who no doubt will shoot off fireworks all night. sigh. I REALLY hate fireworks. CrankyAndi:Yesterday I went to my storage unit to look for Tootsie's thunder shirt.

We did our morning walk already which is good. We did get some more dog poop bags on our walk. the neighborhood provides bags for us. I'm sure there are some folks who do not like that they pay for the bags. People like to complain.

She's a dachshund and maybe a pittie mix. She's longer than she is tall, doesn't take crap from any of the big dogs, and loves to put her paws on your shoulders when you're crouched down and nibble on your ears.[Fark user image image 850x1133] kdawg7736:[scontent-iad3-2.xx.fbcdn.net image 526x526] Want to see behind the curtain?
