Policy** ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (\u201cAI\u201d) USAGE Artificial intelligence is the use of computer systems and models capable of performing complex tasks, such as reasoning, decision making, and problem solving. Within newsgathering, AI can create something new, such as text, images, graphics, and interactive media. Although AI has the potential to improve newsgathering, it also has the potential to harm journalists\u2019 credibility and our unique relationship with our audience. The Company has established the following guidelines/principles that will govern acceptable use of AI: - Transparency \u2013 maintaining public trust is imperative as such AI usage must not impact the public\u2019s trust in our work and must be disclosed. When we publish any content that was created by AI, we disclose it to our audience. Transparency extends to internal notifications to management to ensure compliance with this policy. - Accuracy \u2013 all information generated by AI requires human verification. The use of AI must not impact the accuracy of the final work product. It is the journalist\u2019s job to ensure the accuracy of all content produced, including AI. - Intellectual Property \u2013 the use of AI-based tools and the content produced must not violate the intellectual property rights of others. - Privacy and Security \u2013 personally identifiable information and intellectual property of the Company cannot be entered into AI programs. The Company requires journalists and content-producers to be responsible for the facts they gather, verify, and publish. The use of AI tools for article composition, scriptwriting, editing, and image generation are strictly prohibited on all platforms. The Company has identified the following acceptable uses of AI: - Research \u2013 it is generally acceptable to obtain publicly available research, mine public databases, or assemble and calculate statistics. However, journalists must independently verify any information that is used in the creation and final work product. - Headline Experimentation \u2013 generating headline options is considered a form of research. Once again, the final headline is the responsibility of the journalist and/or editor and must be reviewed for accuracy. - Social Media Content Distribution \u2013 utilizing AI to reformat and publish original content over the various social media platforms is appropriate. - Submitted News Releases \u2013 utilizing AI to reformat submitted news releases for publication across all platforms is appropriate. - Advertising Initiatives \u2013 utilizing AI to perform a wide variety of advertising related work including but not limited to generating ad copy, proposal preparation, lead development, client communications, and video compilation. All AI generated advertising material must be edited and reviewed to meet all truth in advertising standards before it is distributed. AI is a rapidly developing and ever-changing technology. The Company\u2019s use of AI must be guided by what will be useful to our audience and customers. The Company will continue to monitor developments and update this policy as needed. 9/26/2024 Past Editions **Latest Messenger** Jun 10, 2025 Past Editions **Extra Coverage** 6 hrs ago **Most Popular** Articles Images Videos Commented Jeffrey Dale Rodgers Carolyn H.
