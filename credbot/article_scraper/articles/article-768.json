The district sued the DHS in February to stop federal immigration enforcement officials from making arrests at \u201csensitive locations\u201d such as schools, churches, and hospitals \u2013 policies that had been in place since 1993. In their lawsuit, DPS claimed the change in federal immigration policy under the second Trump administration was hindering the district from fulfilling its mission to students and was forcing them to divert resources schools needed to prepare its staff in case of immigration arrests on DPS property. In court, DPS officials argued a previous policy under former President Joe Biden provided some guardrails for immigrant families, while the newer policy wasn\u2019t clear as to when immigration arrests would take place. But in a rebuttal issued by DHS the same month, attorneys for the federal agency said the newer policy wasn't that much different from the one that was in place before Trump took office a second time. Ultimately, a Trump-appointed federal judge in early March ruled against the district\u2019s request for a preliminary injunction to block ICE from enforcing raids at schools, saying the district could not show that the harm DPS claimed to have incurred was due to the change in federal immigration policy under the Trump administration, but more so the result of widespread concerns about what that change could mean for immigrant families across the district. District officials said Tuesday their lawsuit\u2019s claim was moot after DHS published a newer policy and \u201cadmitted that the policy had not been fundamentally changed from the previous version.\u201d \u201cThis was another significant victory for DPS and school districts nationwide, as the Department of Homeland Security admitted in federal court that the policy had not been changed in a meaningful way and that schools remained protected as sensitive locations,\u201d district officials said in a news release, adding that information that the policy wasn\u2019t that much different under the Biden administration was \u201cnot previously known.\u201d The lawsuit against DHS was dismissed without prejudice, which gives DPS the opportunity to refile should immigration enforcement agents come onto school property or conduct enforcement activities near a school. In a statement announcing the dismissal of their lawsuit, district officials said Tuesday the district would not hesitate to refile the lawsuit should circumstances change. \u201cStudents cannot learn unless they feel safe and welcome in our schools,\u201d a DPS spokesperson said. \u201cWe owe that to them.\u201d Report a typo **Sign up for theBreaking News Newsletterand receive up to date information.** **now signed up to receive theBreaking News Newsletter.** **If You Give A Child A Book Campaign Changes Lives In Our Community** **If You Give A Child A Book Campaign Changes Lives In Our Community** News Weather Traffic Sports 360 Perspective Don't Waste Your Money Support Sitemap Do Not Sell My Info Privacy Policy Privacy Center Journalism Ethics Guidelines Terms of Use EEO Careers FCC Public Files FCC Application Public File Contact Us Accessibility Statement Scripps Media Trust Center Closed Captioning Contact KOAA koaa_5 koaa"}
