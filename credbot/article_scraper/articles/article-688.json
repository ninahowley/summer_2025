The essay, \u201cAmerica Is Cursed by a Foreign Policy of Nostalgia,\u201d challenges decades of militarism and neoliberal economic policies that have prioritized corporate and elite interests over the well-being of most Americans and people worldwide. With the 2024 election confirming the collapse of Washington\u2019s traditional foreign policy consensus, Okail and Duss argue that neither \u201cAmerica First\u201d unilateralism nor liberal internationalism can address the urgent needs of a world grappling with climate change, economic inequality, and political instability. Instead, they call for a transformative foreign policy rooted in shared global challenges, equitable economic reform, and principled international cooperation. \u201cThe United States must choose between advancing a genuinely equitable global order or clinging to an undemocratic and unsustainable quest for global primacy,\u201d saidOkail. \u201cOur current trajectory not only fails to meet the needs of working Americans but also alienates nations and peoples worldwide that are calling for a more just and inclusive international system.\u201d Key recommendations in the essay include: Ending Failed Militarism: Shifting from prioritizing global military hegemony at any cost to a foreign policy that prioritizes human security, accountability, conflict prevention, and consistent application of international laws and norms. Breaking from Neoliberal Economics: Ensuring prosperity is more widely shared among US communities, while reducing global inequality and economic precarity through equitable trade, labor, and investment rules, including by reforming global institutions like the World Bank and International Monetary Fund to support low- and middle-income countries, enabling sustainable development and debt relief. Redefining Relations with China: Moving beyond Great Power Competition and zero-sum strategic thinking to focus on collaborative solutions for climate change, public health, technological innovation, and a more inclusive global economic and political system. \u201cDecades of militarized foreign policy and economic systems designed to benefit corporations and the wealthy have left working-class Americans\u2014and communities around the world\u2014paying the price,\u201d addedDuss. \u201cThe 2024 election put a decisive stamp on what has long been clear: the Washington foreign policy consensus is not only intellectually bankrupt but also increasingly alienating to the American people. It\u2019s time for a new approach that breaks from the false choice between \u2018America First\u2019 unilateralism and \u2018America is Back\u2019 nostalgia, focusing instead on the needs of everyday people and a future built on common good, human rights, and shared prosperity.\u201d This essay is a call to action for policymakers, thought leaders, and citizens who recognize that the challenges of the 21st century require a fundamentally new approach to U.S. leadership.
