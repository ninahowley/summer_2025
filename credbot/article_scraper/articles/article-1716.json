The rate of greening has been increasing since the turn of the century, with estimates of growth ranging around 14-20% over 40 years, but this information is not being reported by left-wing corporate media, which is preoccupied with promoting the Net Zero fantasy.

The corporate media have failed to report on this greening phenomenon, despite being easily tracked by satellite. \u201cGlobal greening heads a long list of taboo subjects for captured journalists promoting the political Net Zero fantasy,\u201d Chris Morrison,The Daily Sceptic\u2019s Environment Editor, wrote last week. Adding, \u201cGlobal greening helps reduce world famine and reclaim desert areas but it is not of the slightest interest in the mainstream since it disrupts the fake claims of a climate in crisis due to humans burning hydrocarbons.\u201d Despite the best efforts of left-wing corporate media\u2019s activist journalism, nature will do what nature will do. Estimates of global vegetation growth range around 14-20% over just 40 years and recent scientific work has found that the rate of greening has actually been increasing since the turn of the century. The Spanish researcherspublished their paper in January 2025. They said that 38% of the world\u2019s land surface shows significant vegetation change, with 76% of the change total showing more greening and those areas with more plant life showing higher rates of additional growth, helping to confirm global greening. The results of the Spanish researchers are replicated in recent scientific work, and should not be a surprise since plants on Earth have evolved to thrive in levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) much higher than the current historically sparse totals around 400 parts per million (ppm). Far from being a pollutant, as climate change alarmists want the public to believe, CO2is rightly known as the gas of life. Agroup of Chinese scientistsnoted there has been an \u201caccelerated rate\u201d of recent vegetation growth. Agroup of American scientistsrecently highlighted 2020 as a \u201chistoric landmark\u201d since it registered as the greenest year in the satellite record from 2001 to 2020. Debate over the percentage of total global land greening and \u2018browning\u2019 is ongoing, with some work finding a greening change over at least 50% of the surface. The benefits of global greening include reducing world famine and reclaiming desert areas. Some deserts across the world are reducing in size, particularly around areas prone to subsistence living, and considerable greening across Eurasia has also been found by many scientific teams. In their paper \u2018Environmental Drivers of Agricultural Productivity Growth\u2019 for theNational Bureau of Economic Research, authors Charles Taylor and Wolfram Schlenker have consistently found a large fertilisation effect of a 1 ppm increase in CO2equates to higher crop yields, but this has been ignored by outlets such as theBBCandThe Guardian. The above is paraphrased from the article \u2018Global Greening From Higher CO2 Hits \u201cStriking\u201d New Heights \u2013 but the Mainstream Media Won\u2019t Tell You About It\u2019 published by The Daily Sceptic.
