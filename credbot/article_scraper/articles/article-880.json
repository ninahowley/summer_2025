The King Kekaulike softball team made history in the 2025 season, earning their first-ever berth in the Hawaii High School Athletic Association\u2019s Division I State Championships. It was a season defined by growth, elevated goals and a drive to push new boundaries \u2014 as King Kekaulike softball continues to build, travel and compete in Division I. From Upcountry Maui to M\u0101noa Valley, the N\u0101 Ali\u2019i embraced the opportunity to take the field May 6-9 at the University of Hawai\u2019i \u2014 playing in the same stadium as the Rainbow Wahine. For a team from a small-town community, stepping onto the state\u2019s biggest stage brought a mix of excitement and nerves. It was an eye-opening experience for these young athletes and a special opportunity with the UH athletic department opening its facilities to high school players from across the islands. Playing in a college stadium served as a powerful source of inspiration for the girls, highlighting their aspirations to compete at the next level. Helping each athlete prepare for that next step is a core focus for coach Kylie Asher, who is dedicated to instilling the mindset and skills needed to pursue their dreams beyond high school. \u201cI say pressure is a privilege \u2014 it means you are playing for something bigger,\u201d Asher said. \u201cWe have two seniors who are playing college ball next year. Maile Garcia will be playing at the University of Puget Sound, and Hulali Williams will be playing at Lewis and Clark College. Most of if not all of our juniors and sophomores are hoping to play collegiate as well.\u201d The King Kekaulike softball team finished runner-up in the MIL this season and qualified for state.

Coach Asher reflected on how playing at Rainbow Wahine Stadium for the first time was an adjustment, but emphasized the importance of taking each game as it came. By trusting their preparation and staying connected to the love of the game, the team was able to play with confidence and composure. \u201cA lot of the time players will put pressure on themselves to get a big hit, but what we worked on this year is getting base hits and to keep the inning going or \u2018pass the bat,'\u201d Asher said. \u201cWhen we keep things simple and don\u2019t overdo it, those big hits eventually come.\u201d With a shared sense of purpose both on and off the field, this N\u0101 Ali\u2019i team has embraced the power of connection, communication, and support. They know that softball is a team sport \u2014 and reaching individual or collective goals isn\u2019t possible without cohesion. This season marked a major milestone: King Kekaulike\u2019s first appearance at the state tournament since 2006 \u2014 and their first ever at the Division I level. Stepping beyond the familiarity of playing only Maui teams, the experience was new and unfamiliar, but King K took that leap \u2014 and rose to the occasion. Along the way, King Kekaulike built more than wins. From the coaching staff to the athletes themselves, N\u0101 Ali\u02bbi softball is creating a strong, united team that\u2019s helping shape the future of the sport for young female athletes on Maui. **Newsletter** **Local News** **Local News** **\u200b\u200bValley Isle Community FCU holds school supply drive for MEO Head Start** **\u200b\u200bValley Isle Community FCU holds school supply drive for MEO Head Start** Valley Isle Community Federal Credit Union is holding its annual preschool supply drive for the children of Maui ... **Nolan Aguinaldo named GM of Castle Kama\u2018ole Sands** **Nolan Aguinaldo named GM of Castle Kama\u2018ole Sands** Castle Resorts & Hotels has appointed Nolan Aguinaldo as general manager of Castle Kama\u2018ole Sands.
