It was not so long ago that a new wave of democratic socialist organizing exploded onto the scene \u2013 but the defeat of candidates such as Bernie Sanders and Jeremy Corbyn, following on the crumbling of the \u201cnew parties\u201d in Europe, had a deflating effect. As Greece\u2019s Syriza, Spain\u2019s Podemos, and Portugal\u2019s Bloco let down the leftist movements that brought them to power, those inspired by Hugo Chavez in Latin America also saw the Bolivarian revolutions hit an impasse. We find socialist strategy again at a crossroads, pressed by the urgent need to find new directions forward amidst mounting crises. At this new conjuncture, what is left of the strategy, tactics, and organizations that had seemed so promising? Is the \u2018new socialist\u2019 left starting over, or moving on? Socialist Register 2025 engages with the openings and closures of at the crossroads of Socialist strategy, with case studies from Britain, US, Pakistan, Argentina, Germany, Bolivia, Barcelona, and Turkey, engaging with topics such as social struggles over climate change, Palestine solidarity, public banks, re-municipalization of utilities, and unions. **Subjects include:** \u2013 Legacies of the New Left: \u2018Transforming the state\u2019 today\u2013 Socialist strategy: Trade unions, elections, and social movements\u2013 Analysis of the \u201cnew left\u201d European parties, Momentum, and DSA\u2013 The current state of the \u201cpink tide\u201d and left forces in Latin America\u2013 Left political organizing in Turkey and the role of international law in Palestine-Israel\u2013 The German Left at a crossroads\u2013 North American unions and the \u2018rank and file strategy\u2019\u2013 Limits of liberal internationalism and the law\u2014the Gaza case\u2013 Confronting radical libertarianism and the Millei government in Argentina\u2013 The failings of identity politics and Afro-American politics\u2013 Radical ecology, civil disobedience and the left\u2013 In search of new socialist movements and strategies Publication Date:March 2025 Number of Pages:344 Paperback ISBN:978-1-68590-115-8 eBook ISBN:978-1-68590-117-2 Description Additional information **Related products** Monthly Review Volume 2, Number 6 (October 1950) [PDF]$10.00Add to cart **Monthly Review Volume 2, Number 6 (October 1950) [PDF]** **Monthly Review Volume 2, Number 6 (October 1950) [PDF]** **Monthly Review Volume 2, Number 6 (October 1950) [PDF]** Monthly Review Volume 2, Number 5 (September 1950) [PDF]$10.00Add to cart **Monthly Review Volume 2, Number 5 (September 1950) [PDF]** **Monthly Review Volume 2, Number 5 (September 1950) [PDF]** **Monthly Review Volume 2, Number 5 (September 1950) [PDF]** Monthly Review Volume 2, Number 2 (June 1950) [PDF]$10.00Add to cart **Monthly Review Volume 2, Number 2 (June 1950) [PDF]** **Monthly Review Volume 2, Number 2 (June 1950) [PDF]** **Monthly Review Volume 2, Number 2 (June 1950) [PDF]** Monthly Review Volume 1, Number 10 (February 1950) [PDF]$10.00Add to cart **Monthly Review Volume 1, Number 10 (February 1950) [PDF]** **Monthly Review Volume 1, Number 10 (February 1950) [PDF]** **Monthly Review Volume 1, Number 10 (February 1950) [PDF]** Monthly Review Volume 1, Number 7 (November 1949) [PDF]$10.00Add to cart **Monthly Review Volume 1, Number 7 (November 1949) [PDF]** **Monthly Review Volume 1, Number 7 (November 1949) [PDF]** **Monthly Review Volume 1, Number 7 (November 1949) [PDF]** Monthly Review Volume 1, Number 5 (September 1949) [PDF]$10.00Add to cart **Monthly Review Volume 1, Number 5 (September 1949) [PDF]** **Monthly Review Volume 1, Number 5 (September 1949) [PDF]** **Monthly Review Volume 1, Number 5 (September 1949) [PDF]** 2025 Monthly Review Foundation.
