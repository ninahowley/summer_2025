Why wasn\u2019t it sent until years later? On Dec. 6, 2021, Zambian financial crime investigators sent a confidential memo to their counterparts in Eswatini, the country formerly known as Swaziland. In it, the Zambian Financial Intelligence Centre (ZFIC) laid out serious allegations that the country\u2019s former president, Edgar Lungu, had \u201caccumulated wealth through corrupt activities.\u201d The memo also raised concerns regarding Zambian-Swazi construction magnate Michelo Shakantu, 49, who is married to Pholile Dlamini-Shakantu, Eswatini\u2019s minister of foreign affairs and former justice minister. A key allegation was that one of Shakantu\u2019s companies, Inyatsi Road Construction, had \u201cobtained a number of road construction contracts and in turn offered bribes in [the] form of land and monetary gifts to high profile individuals.\u201d Lungu \u2014 who led Zambia from January 2015 to August 2021, when he was voted out amid accusations that his government was corrupt and increasingly authoritarian \u2014 was allegedly one of the beneficiaries of these gifts, the ZFIC noted, writing that in 2018, Shakantu bought a plot of land for Lungu at a luxury golf estate in Eswatini. While the contents of the memo were damning, the timing was suspicious. The memo was dated August 2019, when Lungu was in power, but it wasn\u2019t submitted to the Eswatini Financial Intelligence Unit (EFIU) until December 2021 \u2014 more than three years after the allegations of the gifted land first surfaced and only after Lungu lost Zambia\u2019s presidential election to opposition candidate Hakainde Hichilema. Hichilema, who\u2019d spent four months in jail during Lungu\u2019s term for what were widely believed to be trumped-up treason charges, won the presidency in a landslide after pledging to restore the rule of law and revive the economy. He also promised to clamp down on corruption that was believed to have spiraled out of control under Lungu. When he left office, Lungu, his Cabinet and his family were plagued by scandals, and Zambia \u2014 a landlocked country of roughly 20 million people \u2014 was Africa\u2019s most indebted nation. The confidential memo is one of the many documents leaked from the EFIU as part of Swazi Secrets, an investigation into suspicious money flows in Eswatini.Distributed Denial of Secrets, a nonprofit devoted to publishing and archiving leaks, obtained the more than 890,000 documents from the EFIU and shared them with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists and seven media partners. The EFIU is an independent body set up to identify and investigate complex financial crime. Like other such agencies, including the ZFIC in Zambia, it receives information from institutions like banks, and works with local and international organizations. The information collected and analyzed by the EFIU does not necessarily prove that illicit activity or a crime has taken place, but instead reflects the unit\u2019s suspicions. Documents from the Swazi Secrets trove show that authorities in Eswatini \u2014 a tiny southern African kingdom nearly 1,000 miles from Zambia by road \u2014 flagged both Lungu and his \u201cassociate\u201d Shakantu, with the EFIU stating it had \u201creasonable grounds to suspect that Michelo Shakantu and his associates are involved in illegal activities of which might have benefitted Dr. Lungu.\u201d Recommended reading **How international gold dealers exploited a tiny African kingdom\u2019s economic dream** **How international gold dealers exploited a tiny African kingdom\u2019s economic dream** **Millions in suspicious transactions tie South Africa\u2019s ruling party to a controversial Swazi archbishop, documents show** **Millions in suspicious transactions tie South Africa\u2019s ruling party to a controversial Swazi archbishop, documents show** **Frequently asked questions about the Swazi Secrets investigation** **Frequently asked questions about the Swazi Secrets investigation** The leaked documents highlight the political constraints on entities like the EFIU and ZFIC \u2014 and the institutions they report to, like anti-corruption agencies and law enforcement. As a 2017 unpublished draft of the National Risk Assessment \u2014 a high-level Eswatini government review of the country\u2019s exposure to money laundering \u2014 put it: \u201cEven though safeguards exist in law, politicians may interfere with [financial crime] investigations. \u2026 Although [financial crime] investigators are well protected in terms of the legal framework, in practice they are not well protected against these political pressures.\u201d **Presidential plot** Swazi media broke the news of the alleged gift of land in May 2018. The details were hazy, but they sparked a public outcry. One opposition politician appealed to Zambia\u2019s top court for a ruling that Lungu \u2014 a lawyer and former military officer \u2014 violated an anti-corruption law in allegedly accepting the gift. The land was within the expansive Nkonyeni Residential Golf Estate, in the rural heart of Eswatini. Residential plots and houses of varying sizes there are available for well-off buyers. On its website, Nkonyeni boasts \u201cstress-free living, within a secure estate \u2014 complete with nature trails, a health spa, and two world-class championship golf courses.\u201d Local media reported that Lungu planned to build a $4 million two-story mansion there, raising questions in the news over who was funding the building. Designs for the mansion circulated widely on social media. In a startling admission at the time, Zambia\u2019s then-information minister Dora Siliya told Zambian media that Eswatini\u2019s king, Mswati III, had given the land for the planned residence as a gift to Lungu, adding that this was \u201cnormal\u201d \u2014 that when the president travels, \u201cvarious gifts are given in various forms, and in this case it was land that was given to the president.\u201d The story took a twist when Swazi media reported that the property was in fact not owned by Lungu but held through a company owned by Shakantu, the construction magnate. Shakantu also allegedly held shares for Lungu in telecom company Swazi Mobile. But while the news was reported in May 2018, Zambian authorities were slow to act. The confidential ZFIC memo dated August 2019 linked the Nkonyeni property in Eswatini to the alleged bribes for construction contracts in Zambia, and cited media reports that the gifted land was one of 90 plots owned by lnyatsi Properties Ltd., another Shakantu company. The document, however, was emailed by a ZFIC employee to the EFIU on Dec. 6, 2021 \u2014 nearly four months after Lungu lost Zambia\u2019s presidential election. The employee noted that the memo, which asked for help with the ZFIC\u2019s investigation, could not be sent earlier \u201cdue to unforeseen circumstances\u201d but did not mention what those circumstances were. Maurice Nyambe, executive director of Transparency International Zambia, an anti-corruption organization, told ICIJ that he suspects political interference was to blame for the delay, writing in an email that this \u201cexemplifies the point about interference with state institutions.\u201d The ZFIC\u2019s board, Nyambe notes, is appointed by the president, \u201cso the potential for the presidency to exert influence on the Board is extremely high, and it is inconceivable and even na\u00efve to think that such a thing has never happened before.\u201d The head of the ZFIC, Clement Kapalu, declined to respond to questions put to him by The Africa Report, one of ICIJ\u2019s partners on the Swazi Secrets project. He told that publication that the ZFIC \u201cdoes not discuss persons that are subject of enquiry except with competent authorities.\u201d Lungu did not respond to questions sent to him in April via his foundation by ICIJ partner OpenSecrets. After the April 15 publication of Swazi Secrets, a Zambian government minister was cited in local media challenging Lungu to explain the funding for any investments he might have in Eswatini, including, presumably, the Nkonyeni property. In response, Lungu issued a statement on Facebook denying owning property in Eswatini. \u201cDuring my official visit to Eswatini as Head of State in 2018, the King \u2014 His Majesty Mswati III \u2014 during exchange of gifts, offered me a plot on which he proposed I could build a house,\u201d Lungu said in his statement. \u201cThe empty plot was in a gated golf estate and architectural drawings of the proposed house were prepared. I was extremely grateful for the offer from His Majesty, King Mswati III, but I chose not to take it up particularly after the hullabaloo in Zambia, alleging that the gift was not declared,\u201d he said, referring to the 2018 media outcry. Lungu labeled the allegations against Shakantu an \u201cattack\u201d and \u201cmalicious.\u201d **The \u2018associate\u2019** When the EFIU wrote back to the ZFIC in January 2022, a couple of months after it received the August 2019 memo, it said it had received information on \u201cunusual and suspicious activities on the bank accounts of Michelo Shakantu, who is suspected to be an associate of Dr. Lungu.\u201d Michelo Shakantu is a shareholder and executive chairman of the Inyatsi Group, which was originally established as a construction company and now has a diversified portfolio \u2014 including holdings in coal, insurance, telecommunications and other industries \u2014 across several African countries. He lives in Eswatini, where Inyatsi has gleaming offices in the commercial hub of Manzini. The company is a ubiquitous presence across the kingdom; its black-and-white buffalo logo is a common sight in ads, on branded vehicles and at construction sites, and Shakantu has been photographed alongside King Mswati at official events and ribbon-cutting ceremonies. \u201cI am very happy with what Shakantu and his team are doing for the country as they collaborate with the government to provide massive support for the empowerment and improvement of the lives of emaSwati,\u201d or the Swazi people, the king told the Eswatini Financial Times in March. Inyatsi was mentioned in a 2016 forensic report on corruption at a state-owned rail company \u2014 a report commissioned by South Africa\u2019s National Treasury. It found that Inyatsi Construction Pty Ltd. benefited from a flawed procurement process. Shakantu also co-founded Swazi Mobile with Victor Gamedze, a controversial and highly influential businessman who was murdered in 2018. (Last year, a businessman and football club director was convicted of orchestrating the killing.) Gamedze married into the royal family and was said to be a close associate of the king. According to leaked documents, as of early 2022, the EFIU could not tie any Eswatini property or accounts directly to Lungu. The Nkonyeni property was not registered to Shakantu or his company, Inyatsi, either. However, the EFIU found that the Nkonyeni property was owned by the Link Trust, which the EFIU told its Zambian counterpart was \u201cduly represented by Mr. Michelo Shakantu, which in a way links Dr Lungu to Mr. Shakantu, although the property is still not developed.\u201d Eswatini\u2019s real estate sector is a hotspot for cross-border money laundering due to an insufficient \u201cregulatory framework,\u201d as the country\u2019s draft National Risk Assessment notes. In its report to Zambia\u2019s ZFIC, the EFIU scrutinized Shakantu\u2019s finances and the numerous accounts and companies it said were linked to him, noting that for some transactions it could not determine the \u201ctrue source.\u201d \u201cThe EFIU has also observed that Mr Shakantu, in some entities, is not the Director nor a shareholder or a signatory, but he is the one who funds those accounts.\u201d The unit concluded, in rather vague language, that it \u201ccannot rule out that the accounts of the subject and the identified entities might have been used to facilitate illegal transactions for purposes unknown to the EFIU.\u201d The EFIU told its Zambian counterpart that it had shared this evidence with Swazi authorities in Eswatini and South Africa\u2019s Financial Intelligence Centre. Leak to us Contact ICIJ **Do you have a story about corruption, fraud, or abuse of power?** **Stalled investigations?** It was not the first time Shakantu \u2014 or his wife \u2014 had appeared on the EFIU\u2019s radar. In 2017, the year before Pholile Dlamini-Shakantu was appointed justice minister, the EFIU reported her to the Anti-Corruption Commission for a host of suspicious transactions. The EFIU noted the large volumes of cash payments moving through her accounts in the form of \u201cfrequent ATM cash payments, cheque and cash deposits and ATM cash transfers,\u201d mostly from her husband. At the time she was an attorney and the deputy chairperson of the Elections and Boundaries Commission. The EFIU noted that \u201cthe manner in which all these transactions are conducted especially receipts of huge sums of money from her husband Michello [sic] Shakantu in structured amounts and then immediately disposing it to through [online banking] payments and cash withdrawals makes the SFIU to conclude that she could be involved in some sort of criminality bordering around corruption.\u201d The EFIU also scrutinized a series of questionable transactions involving Swazi Mobile, which began operating in July 2017. One of those was an August 2017 payment of about $1.5 million that was split evenly between Michelo Shakantu and Gamedze, supposedly from Swazi Mobile profits. It was \u201chighly unlikely\u201d the company could have generated that amount given that it had become operational only the month before, the EFIU noted. Among other suspicious activity identified by the EFIU was a $3.8 million transaction split into three payments from the Swaziland National Provident Fund \u2014 which manages the retirement savings for all employed Eswatini nationals \u2014 ostensibly to buy shares from Swazi Mobile. The EFIU questioned why most of the money ended up in the personal accounts of Shakantu and his business partner, Gemedze \u2014 who both received more than $1.5 million \u2014 and not Swazi Mobile\u2019s accounts. \u201cWe believe that the funds are being laundered and the claim of buying shares is a front to cover up an alleged illicit act,\u201d the EFIU wrote. The unit also referred to allegations in the Zambian media that Shakantu had looted about $4.6 million meant to patch a road in that country. While the EFIU was \u201cnot certain\u201d if the allegations were true, it did speculate that it \u201ccould possibly a source [sic] of some of the funds circulating in his personal accounts.\u201d OpenSecrets asked Shakantu about the accusations of corruption and his alleged ties to Lungu, to which Inyatsi gave brief responses. The company denied any connection between the Inyatsi boss and Lungu, and said that allegations of Shakantu\u2019s involvement in possible corruption were \u201cnot factual.\u201d The EFIU pointed to evidence Shakantu was involved in illegal activities and was shuffling his money around in ways designed to conceal its origin, potentially benefiting the former head of state. But investigations appear to have hit a political obstacle. Minutes of a November 2018 meeting between officials of the EFIU and Eswatini\u2019s Anti-Corruption Commission note that the ACC \u201cstill need to sit down and appraise the incoming Commissioner\u201d of the matter because it touched on politically exposed persons (PEPs). The minutes note that \u201cone of the parties involved\u201d \u2014 Shakantu\u2019s wife \u2014 \u201chas been appointed as the Minister responsible for the institution doing the investigation.\u201d She had also been appointed to head a parliamentary committee tasked with combating corruption, according to the minutes. In July 2022, a document providing an update on the progress of cases referred to the ACC was circulated within the EFIU. It noted that Shakantu and his associates were still \u201cunder active investigation\u201d \u2014 4\u00bd years after the matter was first referred to the ACC. **Want to know when we publish?** Help us change the world.

In Zambia, authorities have cracked down on the former president\u2019s inner circle: In mid-2023, police arrested Lungu\u2019s son and daughter-in-law over allegedly tainted cash and property worth roughly $5 million. Shortly before that, the state seized 20 properties it claimed were illegally obtained by the Lungu family. Last month, Lungu\u2019s wife was arrested alongside one of her daughters in connection with several properties worth more than $2 million. A Zambian law enforcement agency suspected the properties were the proceeds of crime. Corruption \u201cremains a dark stain on Edgar Lungu\u2019s legacy as president,\u201d Transparency International\u2019s Nyambe told ICIJ. Lungu, who is still in Zambia, and his party, the Patriotic Front, told U.S.-based international broadcaster Voice of America that he is the target of \u201ca political witch hunt\u201d as he attempts a political comeback after his 2021 defeat. The former president claims he has faced police harassment after announcing his return to politics last October \u2014 a charge the Hichilema government denies. \u201cI\u2019m facing the consequences of returning to politics,\u201d Lungu told the BBC in late May, \u201cand I\u2019m ready for it.\u201d Contact reporter Our team **Micah Reddy** Reporter and Africa coordinator **Want to know when we publish?** Help us change the world.
