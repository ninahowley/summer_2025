AFP President and CEO Emily Seidelissued the following statement: \u201cAFP has been fighting reckless and wasteful government spending\u2014on both sides\u2014for the last twenty years. There is no question Washington must address our debt crisis. But we didn\u2019t get here overnight, and Washington isn\u2019t going to fix it with one bill. \u201cWe agree we have to cut spending, but we can\u2019t lose sight of an immediate and urgent need\u2014ensuring Americans aren\u2019t hit with the largest tax increase in history. \u201cMillions of families are struggling to pay their bills, buy groceries, and afford today\u2019s skyrocketing cost of living. Killing this bill crushes those families. We know because we talk to them every day. \u201cEven if this bill cuts enough spending to be fully offset, we\u2019re still on a course for bankruptcy that requires comprehensive reforms to how Congress makes spending decisions. That\u2019s why Washington needs to move to budget reform once this bill is done. \u201cAFP fully supports efforts to root out more waste, fraud, and abuse now and in the future. But sinking this important pro-growth and reform-rich bill because it doesn\u2019t solve our debt crisis is reckless and wrong.\u201d Background: On Tuesday, AFPpraisedthe President\u2019s first rescission package. Last month, AFP Senior Fellow in Fiscal Policy Kurt Couchman penned an op-ed in theDaily Callerurging Congress to sign off on the President\u2019s spending cuts. Since thelaunchof AFP\u2019s \u201cProtect Prosperity\u201d campaign, AFP has been a driving force to secure the permanent extension of the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act and advance this legislation: Holding more than 500 events andralliesacross the country with dozens of lawmakers, Reaching out to more than 250,000 voters in key Congressional districts over duringNational Days of Actionand grassroots outreach, Hosting conversationsSpeaker Mike Johnson,Majority Leader Steve Scalise&House Conference Chair Lisa McClain, Millions of dollars inadsand testimonials, More than 1,000 meetings with key legislators and Hill staff, And comprehensivepollingin partnership with Public Opinion Strategies. AFP will continue to leverage its unparalleled grassroots infrastructure to show the overwhelming support for extending the Trump tax cuts and send a message to Republican lawmakers that the American people are with them and now is the time to deliver. -###- **Join the Fight Today (Stay in Touch) (Sidebars)** First Name* Last Name* Email* Zip Code* PhoneThis field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.
