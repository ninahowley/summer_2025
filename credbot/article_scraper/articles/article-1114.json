This newly discovered \u201canti-universe\u201d might run parallel to our own universe, but the researchers say it essentially spread out \u201cbackward\u201d in time, prior to the Big Bang, in the same way our universe progressed \u201cforward\u201d in time. The model eliminates the need for something called \u201cinflation,\u201d a period of time in which the universe massively expanded in order to account for its size soon after birth. Instead, the matter could have naturally expanded over time in a less forceful way, which could simplify our explanation for what happened. If this sounds like wild and heady stuff, you\u2019re absolutely right. But it could finally explain some of the most notorious unanswered questions in all of science, like this one: Justwhat the hell is dark matter?You\u2019re going to want toread the whole anti-universe thing here. See you down the rabbit hole. **\u27a1 Build Your Own DIY Smokeless Fire Pit** After evaluating a bunch of smokeless fire pits, test editor Brad Ford decided to make one himself. \u201cWithout taking anything away from the companies making fire pits,\u201d he says, \u201cthey\u2019re fairly simple once you understand how they work.\u201d The result is thiseasy plan to build your own DIY smokeless fire pit, which members have been downloading in droves. Ford started with a 55-gallon drum, cut roughly in half horizontally, as the main body. Then, he slit one of those halves vertically down the side and squeezed it to a smaller diameter to fit inside the other half; this created the double-wall construction that makes these fire pits work. After adding a bottom, Ford created a cap that bridged the tops of the inner and outer walls. Finally, he cut holes around the base on the outside, in the bottom inside, and around the top edge inside. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly not as pretty as those commercially available, but it works,\u201d Ford says. \u201cAnd there\u2019s pride in building it by hand.\u201d Here\u2019swhat you\u2019ll need to make your own fire pit, and the complete instructions for building it. **\u27a1 Can You Solve the Burning Rope Riddle?** This simple puzzle recently appeared in amembers-only newsletter. Think you can crack it? You have two ropes coated in oil to help them burn. Each rope will take exactly one hour to burn all the way through. However, the ropes don\u2019t burn at constant rates; there are spots where they burn a bit faster and spots where they burn a bit slower, but it always takes one hour to finish the job. With a lighter to ignite the ropes, how can you measure exactly 45 minutes? Click here to see the solution. **\u27a1 The Secret to a Foolproof Trucker\u2019s Hitch** Test editor Roy Berendsohn shared the 12 steps to mastering his time-tested modifiedtrucker\u2019s hitch knotwith members. It\u2019s fast to learn, easy to fashion, and quick to untie. \u201cI\u2019ve used it hundreds of times to secure everything in the bed of my truck, from a pile of groceries to lawnmowers,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd it\u2019s very strong; I\u2019ve never had a load come loose.\u201d See how to rig the hitch to secure any load. **\u27a1 Ask the Expert: The Near-Death Experience Doctor** For the first time,scientists recorded the brain waves of a dying person. The researchers noticed an 87-year-old man\u2019s brain experienced higher-order cognitive functions immediately following cardiac arrest, possibly indicating active memory recall. We askedDr. Sam Parnia, an expert on near-death experiences, what this study reveals about our brain activity at death. Here\u2019s an excerpt of what he told us in themember-exclusive story: Read more about near-death experiences here. **\u27a1 AboutPop Mech Pro** For over 120 years,Popular Mechanicshas strived to be the definitive, evolving manual for understanding everything.
