The historic flight will be commanded by NASA veteran Peggy Whitson and marks a significant milestone in commercial spaceflight.Watch the launch live. The mission will be piloted by Shubhanshu Shukla, who will become India\u2019s second national astronaut to reach space since 1984. Speaking toBBC, Shukla reflected on the emotional weight of the moment, saying, \u201cAs I go into space, I carry not just instruments and equipment, I carry hopes and dreams of a billion hearts.\u201d Also on board isS\u0142awosz Uzna\u0144ski, a European Space Agency project astronaut and Poland\u2019s second astronaut since 1978, andTibor Kapu, Hungary\u2019s second national astronaut since 1980. The mission will be commanded by NASA veteranPeggy Whitson, who adds to herstanding recordfor the longest cumulative time in space by an American astronaut. This marks her second commercial human spaceflight mission. What sets Ax-4 apart is its ambitious research agenda, featuring around 60 scientific studies representing 31 countries, including the U.S., India, Poland, Hungary, Saudi Arabia, Brazil, Nigeria, the UAE, and nations across Europe. It marks the most extensive research portfolio of any Axiom Space mission to date, spanning human health, Earth observation, and biological and material sciences, demonstrating the growing global investment in microgravity research. Among the highlights is also a newpartnershipbetween NASA and the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), which is collaborating on several investigations aboard the Ax-4 mission. These include experiments on muscle regeneration, the growth of sprouts and edible microalgae, the survival of tiny aquatic organisms, and how humans interact with electronic displays in space. According toAxiom Space, \u201cThe Ax-4 mission stands as a beacon of opportunity for India, Poland, and Hungary, each poised to leverage this mission to advance their national space programs.\u201d The mission underscores how commercial spaceflight is creating new avenues for countries to participate in the space economy and contribute to humanity\u2019s understanding of living and working in space. **Other missions this week** Starlink Group 12-24will lift off on a Falcon 9 Block 5 on June 10 at 9:03 A.M. EDT from Cape Canaveral. The mission will deliver more Starlink satellites to orbit, likely including a mix of Direct-to-Cell and standard v2-mini satellites for SpaceX\u2019s expanding internet service. The Mountain God Guardsmission will use Rocket Lab\u2019s Electron vehicle on June 11 at 11:15 A.M. EDT from Launch Complex 1 in New Zealand. This launch will carry an iQPS synthetic aperture radar satellite, part of iQPS\u2019 planned 36-satellite constellation capable of monitoring specific points on Earth every 10 minutes, even through clouds and adverse weather. Starlink Group 15-6launches on a Falcon 9 Block 5 on June 12 at 9:46 P.M. EDT from Vandenberg Space Force Base. This mission will deploy another batch of Starlink v2-mini satellites to further expand SpaceX\u2019s internet constellation. Project Kuiper (KA-02)will utilize United Launch Alliance\u2019s Atlas V 551 rocket on June 13 at 2:29 A.M. EDT from Cape Canaveral. This mission will deploy Amazon\u2019s second prototype Kuiper broadband satellite, part of a planned 3,236-satellite constellation that will provide internet access from low Earth orbit. China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC)is set to launch a Long March 2D rocket on June 13 at 3:55 A.M. EDT from Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in China. This mission will carry an unspecified payload to low Earth orbit. Starlink Group 12-26rounds out the week with another Falcon 9 Block 5 launch on June 13 at 7:45 P.M. EDT from Cape Canaveral. This mission will deploy additional Starlink v2-mini satellites to continue building out SpaceX\u2019s global internet service. **Looking ahead** Looking ahead to the week of June 16\u201322, several launches are on the horizon. On June 16, a United Launch Alliance Atlas V 551 will carry a national security payload from Cape Canaveral, and SpaceX is slated to launch Starlink Group 15-9 on a Falcon 9 from Vandenberg SFB, continuing the expansion of its low Earth orbit internet network. On June 18, Russia is expected to launch an Angara A5 rocket from Plesetsk Cosmodrome carrying a classified military payload. Rounding out the week on June 21, SpaceX\u2019s latest small satellite rideshare mission, Transporter-14, will lift off from Vandenberg to Sun-synchronous orbit.
