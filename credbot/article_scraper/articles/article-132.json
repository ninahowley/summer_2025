It turns outTiresis more than just a show about an auto repair shop \u2014 it\u2019s quickly becoming one ofNetflix\u2019smost unlikely success stories. The blue-collarworkplace comedycreated by Shane Gillis, Steve Gerben, and John McKeever returned this week with a second season that\u2019s now sitting near the top of Netflix\u2019s US Top 10 list. As of this writing,TiresSeason 2 is ranked #2 onthe streamer, and it\u2019s sporting a 92 percent audience score on Rotten Tomatoes. Not bad for a comedy that initially felt like Netflix trying a little too hard (at least in my opinion) to prove it also has shows for \u201cguy\u2019s guys,\u201d complete with bro-y banter that sometimes lands and sometimes leaves you groaning. Still, whatever you think of its barstool banter sense of humor, audiences are clearly on board. And Gillis is having a major moment. If you\u2019re new to the name: Shane Gillis is a stand-up comedian known for his 2023 Netflix specialBeautiful Dogs, as well as for his brief (and controversial) brush withSaturday Night Live. He\u2019s since built a massive following, routinely selling out shows, including two sets at the Netflix Is A Joke Fest in 2024. His next Netflix stand-up special is also on the way.

It\u2019s not Gillis hamming it up on stage with a mic; this is him fully in character, playing a version of himself who works at a family-owned chain of auto shops. The show centers on Will (played by Gerben), a painfully anxious man who\u2019s inherited the business from his dad and is doing his best not to run it into the ground. Unfortunately, his cousin Shane (Gillis) joins the team and seems determined to make things even worse. Season 2 picks up after Will and Shane\u2019s chaotic marketing stunt somehow worked, and now they\u2019re trying to keep the momentum going, personally and professionally. Alongside returning cast members like Chris O\u2019Connor and Stavros Halkias, the new season brings in some big names: Thomas Haden Church as Shane\u2019s father, plus appearances from Vince Vaughn, Jon Lovitz, and more. Gillis, Gerben, and McKeever, who also directs the series, continue to steer this testosterone-fueled ride into even more absurd territory. The jokes still lean rough around the edges, but there\u2019s a weird charm in the chaos. Whether you\u2019re a fan of Gillis\u2019 stand-up or just in the mood for a low-stakes workplace comedy that doesn\u2019t take itself too seriously,Tiresmight be worth a test drive. **This article talks about:** Andy Meek is a reporter based in Memphis who has covered media, entertainment, and culture for over 20 years.
