While Moran quickly realized the error of his ways it was too late as the conservative media pounced on his remarks resulting in his suspension pending an investigation. While liberals attacked ABC parent Disney for the suspension saying that it was kow-towing to the Trump administration it was the right thing to do. Moran is supposed to be an unbiased journalist and present the news as such. He is not a pundit and his job isn\u2019t to offer commentary. There are many conservatives who have called for his firing but that would be an overreaction at this point since journalists on both sides have been guilty of inflammatory language on Twitter -now X and have kept their jobs. ABC will probablt take Moran to the woodshed and remind him of his journalistic duties and standards and let him return to the air once things have cooled down a bit which should take long given how fast the news cycle moves but this will only reinforce the notion of liberal media bias in the minds of many Americans.
