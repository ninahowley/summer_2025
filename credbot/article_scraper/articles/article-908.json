The initiative provides a flexible weekend-format bachelor\u2019s degree program tailored for adult learners. The announcement reflected a shared commitment to serving students who prefer face-to-face learning environments and are seeking careers in mental health and addiction recovery. \u201cThis is an amazing opportunity to bring higher education partners together in a way that truly supports adult learners,\u201d said Dr. Patsy Jackson, interim president of SKCTC. \u201cMany students want the support of a cohort and the in-person classroom experience, and this program delivers exactly that.\u201d **Email newsletter signup** The Middlesboro site joined the long-established LWC program at SKCTC\u2019s Cumberland campus. Leaders from both institutions emphasized that the new cohort represents an expansion, not a relocation. Dr. Tommie Ann Saragas, assistant vice president of educational outreach for online and graduate programs at Lindsey Wilson College, called the launch \u201cdeeply personal,\u201d noting that she and Regional Academic Director Dr. Kimberly Brown were among the first adult learners to graduate from the Cumberland site. \u201cWe know how powerful this program can be\u2014it changed our lives,\u201d Sexton said. The hybrid format includes in-person weekend classes with continued online support. Jason Weaver, who currently leads enrollment for LWC\u2019s Cumberland cohort, will serve in the same role at Middlesboro. A licensed counselor with experience in addiction recovery, Weaver will assist students with applications, financial aid, and academic support. \u201cThis partnership helps meet a critical need in our region,\u201d said Dr. Lee Harrison, incoming president of SKCTC. \u201cIt aligns with our mission to serve the whole student and to be part of regional solutions\u2014especially in mental health and recovery services.\u201d The program builds on a 23-year transfer agreement between LWC and SKCTC institutions, offering students a seamless path from an associate degree to a bachelor\u2019s or master\u2019s degree in counseling. Fall enrollment is now open.
