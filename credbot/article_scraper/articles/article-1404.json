Alison Horspool, 61, was diagnosed with glioblastoma IDH \u2013 wildtype grade 4, after being taken to hospital on Christmas day last year with \u201cburning pins and needles\u201d down the left side of her body and slurred speech. Doctors first thought Alison had suffered a stroke, but she was not 100% convinced and decided to pay for the private MRI scan a few months later to \u201cput her mind at ease\u201d \u2013 the scan revealed three masses on her brain. Despite being told she only has a maximum of 16 months to live, Alison is determined to survive for another \u201cfour or five years\u201d so that she can see her six grandchildren and three step-grandchildren grow up. She has found a number of treatments which are currently being tested and could boost her chances of survival in the next few years, but they come with a \u00a3250,000 price tag. Alison said: \u201cI\u2019ve got seven children, nine grandchildren and I\u2019m just not prepared to go yet. \u201cI just need to see the young ones go to school and my eldest, who I call Sparkle, go to prom. \u201cIf I could get four years, I wouldn\u2019t be happy, but I\u2019d have achieved things that I really need to do. \u201cUnfortunately the tumour that I\u2019ve got, you couldn\u2019t get a worse one, because it\u2019s a \u2018wild one\u2019, which means it always grows back.\u201d **RelatedPosts** **Anti-aging drug for dogs set to be available by 2026** **Keir Starmer vows to \u2018close door on Putin\u2019 with GB Energy** **Discount retailer is selling Maltesers Christmas treats for just 1p** **Donald Trump lashes out at judge while giving evidence in civil fraud trial** Alison paid for an MRI scan at the Duchy Hospital in Truro, Cornwall, after returning from holiday in Turkey in January 2023. \u201cI said to my partner, I have to go for an MRI scan just to put my mind at rest whether I\u2019ve had a stroke or not,\u201d she said. \u201cI was at Center Parcs when they called me and said \u2018How are you?\u2019 \u201cI said \u2018I\u2019m tired, I\u2019m trying to push a baby up a hill\u2019. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t believe that I was well.\u201d After receiving the results, Alison went for a biopsy in April 2023 and was given the devastating news that the lumps were in fact a deadly brain cancer and that without treatment, she only had months to live. \u201cWhen we went back to see the specialist my children were with me, and I walked in and said \u2018I\u2019m feeling really good, I hope you\u2019ve got some good news for me\u2019,\u201d said Alison. \u201cHe told me what it was and said one in a million get this. \u201cI\u2019ve got my daughter crying, my stepdaughter gasping, my partner wanting to collapse and I\u2019m like, right, we\u2019ve just got to get on with this.\u201d Even with \u201cchemo pills\u201d and radiation five days a week, her chances of survival remain low, with only 25% of patients hitting the one year mark and 5% surviving for more than five years, according to The Brain Tumour Charity. \u201cI was given three to six months without treatment and 12 to 16 months with treatment,\u201d she said. \u201cSo playing devil\u2019s advocate, I won\u2019t make it to my next birthday.\u201d The diagnosis has scuppered Alison\u2019s plans to retire in the sunshine with her partner, James Elvins, 58. \u201cI\u2019ve been going backwards and forwards to Spain for the past four years because that\u2019s where me and my partner wanted to end our days,\u201d she said. \u201cBut this has all happened, so I\u2019m never going back.\u201d Despite being told that her days are numbered, Alison remains fiercely optimistic and says she is not ready to die. \u201cI\u2019m 61 and I feel like I\u2019ve been rolled a bit of a bad dice here,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I actually look at it like a challenge, it\u2019s just another chapter and I\u2019ll somehow fight this little challenge.\u201d Her grandchildren, Joseph, one, Koby, three, Seve, six, Louie, seven, Arria, eight, and Francesca, 12, are what is keeping Alison\u2019s desire to survive four more years burning, as well as her step-grandchildren Conor, three, Mia, six, and James, eight. \u201cI need to see the young ones playing their first football game and going to school,\u201d she said. \u201cMy eldest granddaughter Francesca is 12 and I want to buy her prom dress with her, so that\u2019s four or five years.\u201d She also praised her children, Abigail, Felicity, Harry, Harvey, George, Mairead and Niall, saying they have gone \u201cabove and beyond\u201d what any parent could possibly expect. Alison has found several treatments which are being trialled in Germany and the United States and could get her to Francesca\u2019s prom. She said: \u201cWe have no choice \u2013 if I want to stay alive, I have to go down the private route, there\u2019s no alternative. \u201cThe trials show that 13% of patients survived over five years. \u201cIf it triples my life, I\u2019m going to get the four years I\u2019ve asked for.\u201d The treatments are expensive, so Alison\u2019s daughters have set up a GoFundMe page in a bid to raise \u00a3250,000 \u2013 they have so far received \u00a32,820. She said: \u201cWe didn\u2019t realise that there had been no research on glioblastoma in like 20 years, and that brain cancer was essentially a death sentence. \u201cIt\u2019s just sad that I\u2019ve got one of the hardest and most expensive cancers. \u201cBut what can you do, you\u2019ve got to just try and raise the money one way or another. \u201cIt\u2019s just unbelievable how kind people have been.\u201d Alison, who has been told the next three weeks of radiotherapy are going to be gruelling, is determined to make the most of the time she has left. \u201cI\u2019ve got to really take advantage of the last however long it will be,\u201d she said. \u201cWhether it\u2019s 16 months, two years or five years, every day is going to count. \u201cBut getting this new treatment is really paramount because without it, I haven\u2019t got a chance.\u201d To support Alison, visit herGoFundMe page. **Subscribeto our Newsletter** Email address: View ourPrivacy PolicyandTerms & Conditions **About Us** TheLondonEconomic.com \u2013 Open, accessible and accountable news, sport, culture and lifestyle.Read more **SUPPORT** We do not charge or put articles behind a paywall.
