This week, we meet a mother and daughter found near the Guadalupe River and brought to theAWS Freeman Fritts Animal Shelterin Kerrville by some amazing volunteers over 10 months ago. \"Pixie was just a 6-week-old floof when she was first spotted teetering along a river trail dangerously close to the water\u2014wobbly, wide-eyed, and working her tiny kitten magic on everyone who saw her,\" said shelter staff. \"The video we received showed signs of Cerebellar Hypoplasia, a neurological condition that affects her coordination\u2014but not her spirit.\" The mom is Trixie, a gorgeous 2-year-old Tuxedo cat that is black with a white bib and boots. Her daughter is Pixie, a 1-year-old solid black domestic shorthair cat. \"The morning after that first sighting, some amazing volunteers found Pixie\u2014and got a surprise,\" said shelter staff. \"Her mom, Trixie, was right by her side. Trixie had clearly been doing everything she could to keep her baby safe, and she hasn\u2019t stopped since.\" **MORE PHOTOS** 1/11KENS 5 StaffThey have been waiting patiently at the shelter in Kerrville for almost a year, just hoping that someone chooses them to love. 2/11KENS 5 StaffThey have been waiting patiently at the shelter in Kerrville for almost a year, just hoping that someone chooses them to love. 3/11KENS 5 StaffThey have been waiting patiently at the shelter in Kerrville for almost a year, just hoping that someone chooses them to love. 4/11KENS 5 StaffThey have been waiting patiently at the shelter in Kerrville for almost a year, just hoping that someone chooses them to love. 5/11KENS 5 StaffThey have been waiting patiently at the shelter in Kerrville for almost a year, just hoping that someone chooses them to love. 6/11KENS 5 StaffThey have been waiting patiently at the shelter in Kerrville for almost a year, just hoping that someone chooses them to love. 7/11KENS 5 StaffThey have been waiting patiently at the shelter in Kerrville for almost a year, just hoping that someone chooses them to love. 8/11KENS 5 StaffThey have been waiting patiently at the shelter in Kerrville for almost a year, just hoping that someone chooses them to love. 9/11KENS 5 StaffThey have been waiting patiently at the shelter in Kerrville for almost a year, just hoping that someone chooses them to love. 10/11KENS 5 StaffThey have been waiting patiently at the shelter in Kerrville for almost a year, just hoping that someone chooses them to love. 11/11KENS 5 StaffThey have been waiting patiently at the shelter in Kerrville for almost a year, just hoping that someone chooses them to love. Now you might think that being a little wobbly would slow down Pixie, but staff say that she doesn't really know that she's any different. \"She plays, she purrs, she zooms,\" said shelter staff. All she really needs now is a safe environment. Other than that? She\u2019s just like any other playful kitten. That's why shelter staff are looking for a calm home for the pair of felines, preferably one with no young children. And one where they can remain indoors. They both love Temptation cat treats and playing with toys that are on a wand. Mom Trixie is super sweet and loving but it might take a little time for Pixie to warm up to someone new. Right now, she might hiss at you, but don't let that scare you off! \"Mama Trixie could eventually be someone\u2019s lap cat and definitely gets her purr machine going,\" said shelter staff. The mama and daughter pair are both healthy (with the exception of Pixie being a little wobbly), current on all of their vaccinations, and already spayed. \"Pixie is now a year old and ready to celebrate her very first birthday in a forever home\u2014with her mama by her side,\" said shelter staff. \"These two are deeply bonded, and we won\u2019t separate them. They\u2019re a perfect match of spunky and serene.\" If you are interested in adopting this bonded pair, pleasecontact AWS Freeman Frittsdirectly at (830) 257-4144. They are located in Kerrville at 515 Spur 100. You can alsovisit their websitefor more information on adopting Trixie and Pixie or another animal from AWS Freeman Fritts. Not quite ready to adopt but have some extra time on your hands? They always need volunteers.CLICK HEREto find out how you can make a difference. Another way to help is by sponsoringone of their \"hard to adopt\" cats. These are cats that continue to be overlooked because they are \"too old, too shy, too cranky or just need too much medical care.\" A bonus of this way of showing your support is no litter box to clean. You get a virtual pet to love, and they get the extra financial help they so desperately need. You will receive monthly photos of your special kitty as well as an update on how they are doing. You can even go visit the shelter and play with them when you have time. You can also stop the sponsorship whenever you'd like, but they hope that you won't. Financial donationsare also always appreciated. You can also donate in person or by mail at 515 Spur 100, Kerrville, TX 78028. Visit theirAmazon wish listto check out what they need the most.
