A group of activists is fighting proposed logging in the Poor Windy project area. In dense forests off I-5 in Josephine County, Oregon, up a few miles of winding dirt roads, a handful of tents, a hammock and an acoustic guitar mark the camp of those describing themselves as \u201cforest defenders.\u201d This land, at the foothills of the Cascades, is a checkerboard of private and public ownership. The square of thick forest where activists have been camping for a week is managed by the Bureau of Land Management, part of the agency\u2019s 11,000-acrePoor Windy projectthat includes areas slated for commercial timber harvest as well as forest thinning to prevent wildfires from getting out of control. One activist, who wants to go by just \u201cTaylor,\u201d gestured to some of the larger trees among the camp. \u201cYou can kind of see the ones with the orange markings around them here. These are all old-growth trees,\u201d she said. What makes a tree \u201cold growth\u201d can vary. But for the BLM, trees between 36 to 40 inches in diameter, depending on the area, and over 174 years old are generally off-limits to logging. At the top of one of these trees, a massive Ponderosa pine with a thin band of orange paint around its trunk, a big banner reads: \u201cNo Old Growth Logging in a Climate Crisis.\u201d There\u2019s a small platform attached to the trunk near the top, over 100 feet above the forest floor. \u201cHow\u2019s the view up there?\u201d yelled Taylor to the tree sitter, who declined to give their name, stationed on the platform. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful. I see mountains all around. I see a lot of other old-growth trees along this ridgeline,\u201d they yelled down. \u201cI\u2019m up here to send a message to the Bureau of Land Management, that there are people watching them. And that we\u2019re here to protest old-growth logging,\u201d they said, speaking over a radio. The activists here claim a logging company plans to put a road through this spot \u2014 that\u2019s why they\u2019ve chosen this location as their camp. Despite these old-growth trees being marked for protection, loggers can cut them down if they are in the way. George Sexton, conservation director with the Ashland-based environmental nonprofit Klamath-Siskiyou Wildlands Center, calls it a loophole. \u201cWhere those tree sitters are shows that the BLM is in fact logging old-growth trees that are older than our nation,\u201d said Sexton. In 2022, President Biden signed an executive order directing federal agencies to inventory old-growth forests and develop policies for their protection. But some conservation groups think the federal government isn\u2019t doing enough and, in response, they have been fighting timber sales like this one. Nearly 40 organizations recently sent a letter to Interior Secretary Deb Haaland and BLM Director Tracy Stone-Manning demanding the cancellation of the Poor Windy project. The BLM has already scaled back the plan, dropping around 10,000 acres, after a judge found it harmed protected spotted owl habitat. And environmental groups recently filed a complaint against the BLM to protect old-growth forest in the Rogue Gold Forest Management Project near Gold Hill in Southern Oregon. \u201cThe BLM needs to faithfully implement old-growth protections, which they\u2019re not doing right now. Or they need to acknowledge that they\u2019re logging old growth and explain why they\u2019re doing it,\u201d said Sexton, whose organization was party to both of those lawsuits. A spokesperson with the BLM\u2019s Medford office, meanwhile, said that old-growth logging isn\u2019t the goal for these projects. \u201cWe work really hard to design timber sales and access roads to have the least amount of impact. We hear from our timber operators that they don\u2019t want to cut those larger trees. It\u2019s a safety issue. It increases the costs,\u201d said Kyle Sullivan, a BLM spokesperson. He said that there are barely any mills left in Oregon that can take old-growth sized logs and claimed those large trees that are felled are left on the forest floor to become wildlife habitat. The BLM has legal requirements for how to manage forests in Josephine County, Sullivan said. The Oregon and California Revested Lands Sustained Yield Management Act of 1937 \u2014 better known as the O&C Act \u2014 mandates the region be managed for permanent timber production. The BLM\u2019s 2016 Southwest Oregon Resource Management Plan sets the quantity of timber sales and also prescribes thinning out forests to reduce fuel for wildfire. \u201cSome studies have shown that over 51% of forests in southwest Oregon are overly dense and in need of treatment. And so the actions that the BLM designs help reduce that competition, they can open up the canopy,\u201d said Sullivan. Although there\u2019s disagreement about whether BLM\u2019s actions in this area will help control wildfires. Sexton, with KS Wild, thinks the Poor Windy project will increase wildfire risk. He claimed that the agency\u2019s efforts at reducing the forest canopy and the planting of Douglas fir trees can raise fire hazards. The BLM, meanwhile, sees those actions as vital to treating forests that have become overgrown after decades of fire suppression. Studies do show that old-growth trees are more resilient to fire. Back at the \u201cforest defender\u201d camp at Poor Windy, while details of forest management are debated in court, this tree sitter deals with more immediate challenges. \u201cWell the sale is called Poor Windy. And it does sometimes get pretty windy up here. So that\u2019s kind of the biggest challenge,\u201d they said. Despite the weather, they don\u2019t plan to come down soon. \u201cHow long you plan on being up there for?\u201d Taylor yelled into the canopy high above their head. \u201cAs long as it takes!\u201d came the reply. **Post navigation** **Leave a ReplyCancel reply** Your email address will not be published.Required fields are marked* Comment* Name* Email* Website Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment. \u0394 **Cart** **Recent Posts** Another Summer, Another Earth First!
