Unlike North99, however, The Maple is solely a journalistic project, and does not conduct any advocacy work whatsoever. Further, The Maple has no affiliation or relationship of any kind with any political party, advocacy group or third-party advertisers. While The Maple is broadly aligned with North99\u2019s aspiration for a more just Canada, The Maple\u2019s managing editor had no involvement with North99, and has full independence and control over the new publication\u2019s content and editorial direction. You can read more aboutour history here. **I made regular donations to North99, but now it\u2019s going to \u2018The Maple.\u2019 What happened?** In August 2021, North99 changed to The Maple, becoming an independent digital news publication, covering Canadian politics from the perspective of the many, not the few. After years of advocacy work, it became clear that the mission of championing the issues of the 99% through media and analysis needed to take the next step.So many of the issues North99 was attempting to address through advocacy were rooted in the same problem. An establishment media that ignores the stories of everyday people while overrepresenting the wealthy and powerful.Founded from the ashes of North99, we\u2019ve sought to makeThe Maplea media outlet for the people and funded by the people. We are 100% funded by individual Canadians like you - no ads, no outside funding, no corporate support. If you supported North99, we encourage you to check out our public-interest journalism. It\u2019s our belief thatThe Maple\u2019s fact-driven journalism from a progressive perspective is what is sorely needed in Canada\u2019s media landscape. If you\u2019ve continued your support through recurring donations, keep in mind that you are entitled to a complimentary Maple subscriptionthat gets you full access to our daily newsletter. Due to limitations with our email software, we asked that donors reach out to us to receive their benefits.
