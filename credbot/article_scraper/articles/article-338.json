It will also largely appeal to that similar demographic. Nothing wrong with that. It is hard to believe the ever-young dancing presence ofFootlooseis now 66 and playing a guy with prostate problems but, hey, everyone gets older and the sweet premise of this film written and directed byMichael J. Weithornis that maybe it is never too late to find something new to re-energize your life, even if it seems that ship has already sailed.Related StoriesPodcastDoc Talk Podcast: Imagine Entertainment Execs Justin Wilkes And Sara Bernstein On New Barbara Walters Movie, Big Slate Of Emmy ContendersFestivals'Re-Creation' Review: 6-Time Oscar Nominee Jim Sheridan Creates Fictional Jury Trial For Real-Life Untried Murder Case In '12 Angry Men' Homage - Tribeca Festival **Related Stories** **Doc Talk Podcast: Imagine Entertainment Execs Justin Wilkes And Sara Bernstein On New Barbara Walters Movie, Big Slate Of Emmy Contenders** **'Re-Creation' Review: 6-Time Oscar Nominee Jim Sheridan Creates Fictional Jury Trial For Real-Life Untried Murder Case In '12 Angry Men' Homage - Tribeca Festival** **Related Stories** **Doc Talk Podcast: Imagine Entertainment Execs Justin Wilkes And Sara Bernstein On New Barbara Walters Movie, Big Slate Of Emmy Contenders** **Doc Talk Podcast: Imagine Entertainment Execs Justin Wilkes And Sara Bernstein On New Barbara Walters Movie, Big Slate Of Emmy Contenders** **'Re-Creation' Review: 6-Time Oscar Nominee Jim Sheridan Creates Fictional Jury Trial For Real-Life Untried Murder Case In '12 Angry Men' Homage - Tribeca Festival** **'Re-Creation' Review: 6-Time Oscar Nominee Jim Sheridan Creates Fictional Jury Trial For Real-Life Untried Murder Case In '12 Angry Men' Homage - Tribeca Festival** Sedgwick plays Cynthia Rand, the 25-years-younger wife of Walter (Judd Hirsch) who sadly is experiencing the onset of dementia, forgetting more than he remembers. This is evidenced as a young man doing a book on the \u201970s Watergate scandal attempts to interview Walter on the subject, since he was a key person working on the committee. Unfortunately, he has little recall in their first conversation, and Cynthia is increasingly concerned about him. When it appears an intruder may have been trying to break into their home one night, she mistakes him for Stan Olszewski (Bacon), a flailing security officer who is attempting to enter the home through an upstairs window simply to do his job. Once she realizes he isn\u2019t breaking in, they strike up a conversation that leads to him asking to use the bathroom as he finds he has to pee a lot \u201cmore frequently\u201d these days. Conveniently, she happens to be a urologist and offers to help him discover the problem. Next thing you know, he is face down on the exam table in her office with his pants down and Cynthia putting on a rubber glove to take a deep dive. In the movies, they call this \u201cmeeting cute.\u201dWatch on Deadline **Watch on Deadline** **Watch on Deadline** Time goes on, her problems with Walter\u2019s decline continues, and she turns to new friend Stan for texting conversations on just about everything. In addition to his medical problems, he is having a hell of a time dealing with his 20-something daughter Sammi (Brittany O\u2019Grady), with whom he lives. Cynthia and Stan become fast friends as they commiserate and find common ground at this point in life. When Walter perks up and invites him to join them at a restaurant in a few days, Stan accepts. However, much to Cynthia\u2019s dismay, he shows up with a hot date who was a young grocery clerk that boldly tried to pick Stan up once when he was checking out. A jealous Cynthia clearly has other plans for her new friend, and one thing leads to another and, well, they hook up as the kids might say. Complications arise as life goes on. That is really whatThe Best You Canis all about \u2013 two boomers connecting at a time in their lives when it appears it is all downhill from here. The spark between them proves otherwise, or so they think. This is something many people of a certain age may identify with, the inevitability of growing old in a society that caters to a generation to which they both don\u2019t belong. What makes it work is its star teaming. Sedgwick is spirited and enthusiastic in her interactions with Bacon, and she hits all the right notes even when it appears she has violated the codes of her profession and gotten too close to the patient. Bacon is always a watchable and superb actor, no matter what role he gets, and this one fits him like a glove. O\u2019Grady is appealing too, a frustrated daughter who is also an aspiring singer. Hirsch does his usual all-pro job ,and Ray Romano even shows up briefly on Zooms as a doctor colleague of Cynthia\u2019s. Weithorn, whose credits are mainly TV sitcoms, delivers a human story that would be just as comfortable on television as in theaters these days, and a streamer is probably its best bet. But thanks to Bacon and Sedgwick\u2019s easy chemistry on screen, as well as off, it is a pleasure to watch no matter how we find it. Producers are Weithorn, Bacon, Sedgwick, Victoria Hill, Andrew Mann, and Andrew Wonder. Title:The Best You CanFestival:Tribeca (Spotlight Narrative)Director-screenwriter:Michael J.
