He\u2019s currently playing in the Baloncesto Superior Nacional league in Puerto Ricoas a member of the Guaynabo Mets, and he got ejected. It\u2019s not something he\u2019s foreign to, having been kicked out of 14 NBA games, tying him for the sixth most in league history. It started with Cousins hanging by the sideline when a courtside fan gave him the middle finger, and Cousins responded by grabbing his crotch and then swatting at the man. His teammates jumped in before anything could escalate and tried to separate them. Still, they kept jawing at each other as referees blew whistles, eventually ejecting Cousins. Then, as he\u2019s walking through the tunnel to the locker room, he\u2019s grilling fans in the crowd when one gives him the middle finger. He responds by lunging at him, so the man throws a drink on him, while others follow suit.In protest, Cousins immediately turned around and tried to confront the attendees. Still, several security guards held him back, even as he tried to get up from the ground after falling. It\u2019s unclear what further kind of punishment Cousins will receive. The four-timeNBA All-Starhasn\u2019t played in the NBA since his 2022 stint with theDenver Nuggets. The following year, he\u2019d join the Mets before playing in Mongolia and Taiwan, but ultimately returned to the island of Puerto Rico. He was a dominating force with theSacramento Kingsuntil 2017, when he was traded to the New Orleans Pelicans. But a year after arriving, he tore his left Achilles in a game against the Houston Rockets. That ended his NOLA stint, and then he\u2019d tear his quad during the playoffs as a member of theGolden State Warriorsin 2019.Injuries sidelined him again in 2020 when he tore his ACL during an offseason pickup game. He was a member of theLos Angeles Lakers\u2019 championshipteam that season but never actually played. But as he finds his way outside of the NBA, see how social media is reacting to his fiery on-court attitude below.
