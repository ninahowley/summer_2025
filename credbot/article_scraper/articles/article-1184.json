But there is a simple solution. Malnutrition is a leading cause of death for children globally, but a scalable, cost-effective solution exists that helps more than 90% of treated children recover. Historically, in places where the IRC works, over 80% of children with acute malnutrition go untreated\u2014the IRC is changing that. U.S. aid funding cuts are putting this critical work at risk\u2014but you can help. Every year, up to two million children lose their lives to acute malnutrition\u2014one child every 15 seconds\u2014even though a simple, effective solution exists. The International Rescue Committee (IRC) is helping to change that. We lead innovation with a simpler, more effective way to treat malnutrition, ensuring more children receive life-saving treatment at a lower cost. Each year, our malnutrition programs treat over 600,000 children across the world, delivering support where it\u2019s needed most. Unfortunately,recent cuts to humanitarian aidfrom the United States are putting this critical work at risk. But with your help, we can continue to save lives. Learn how U.S. aid cuts are threatening the IRC\u2019s malnutrition work around the world. **Save a child's life** **Save a child's life** **What is malnutrition?** **** Acute or chronic? There are various degrees of malnutrition. The most severe cases are typically divided into acute and chronic categories. Acute malnutrition results from insufficient nutritional intake over a short period. Severe acute malnutrition, the most serious form of acute malnutrition, often occurs alongside famine.Children suffering from chronic malnutrition experience lasting damage that results in mental disabilities and hindered physical development. Malnutrition occurs when a child does not receive the adequate nutrition they need to grow and thrive. Acute malnutrition is a life-threatening condition caused by a lack of nutritious food or from illness that causes sudden weight loss. Children with severe acute malnutrition, the most serious version, are more than 11 times as likely to die as other children. For children who survive, the effects of malnutrition can be devastating and long-lasting. It can cause irreversible damage to brain development and significantly weaken the immune system, leaving the child more vulnerable to illness throughout their life. In crisis zones, malnourished children often face enormous challenges in reaching medical care. Poverty, unsafe travel conditions, conflict or environmental obstacles such asflooding, can make hospital visits impossible, especially for children who are already weakened. **How does the IRC treat children with malnutrition?** The IRC is leading innovation in treating acute malnutrition, ensuring more children receive life-saving care. Currently, children who need life-saving treatment are divided into two groups\u2014moderate and severe acute malnutrition\u2014and treated with different products at different locations by separate UN agencies. This fragmented system limits how many children can be reached. The IRC is leading the movement for a more effective, unified treatment plan. Our simplified approach treats all forms of acute malnutrition with a single food product and point of care. We use a color-coded measuring tape to diagnose malnutrition and a nutritional peanut paste known as ready-to-use therapeutic food (RUTF) to treat children. Additionally, the IRC trains community health workers to bring this lifesaving care directly to hard-to-reach communities. The results are clear: the IRC\u2019s approach helps over 90% of children recover, costs 20% less per child treated and uses 25% less product than the traditional UN approach to treating malnutrition. Simplifying malnutrition treatment works\u2014and the IRC is ready to scale up our lifesaving work. **Diagnosing malnutrition with measuring tapes** Timely identification of malnutrition could save a child\u2019s life. The IRC uses a color-coded measuring tape to do just that. This simple tool quickly shows whether a child is at risk, and if so, how severe their condition is. For parents, this tape also offers a convenient way to monitor their child\u2019s health from home, so they can take action before the situation worsens. **Life saving peanut paste: A simple, effective solution** One food product, RUTF, can treat all acutely malnourished children\u2014it's simply a matter of adjusting the dosage to meet their specific needs. This life-saving solution comes in the form of a nutrient-rich peanut paste, packaged conveniently in a squeeze pouch. Unlike traditional treatments requiring clinics or IV drips, RUTF allows parents to care for their children at home. By making treatment more accessible, we can reach more children and save more lives. **Meeting malnourished children at home** In crisis zones, families often face enormous challenges in reaching medical care. Poverty, unsafe travel conditions, conflict or environmental obstacles such asflooding, can make hospital visits impossible, especially for children already weakened by malnutrition. That\u2019s why the IRC\u2019s mobile health teams travel to where help is needed most, saving families from having to travel far to hospitals for care. We also train community health workers to diagnose and treat malnutrition, helping build a healthier future at a fraction of the cost of traditional treatment approaches. **At a glance: Meet IRC staff treating malnutrition in Nigeria** Nigeriais one of the 21 countries where the IRC delivers life-saving malnutrition support\u2013and where this work is now in jeopardy. For more than a decade, armed conflict in northern Nigeria has forced countless families from their homes, disrupting their ability to farm and earn a livelihood. Severe flooding has made the crisis worse, devastating food supplies, disrupting agricultural activities, displacing families and pushing more children into malnutrition. In 2023 alone, our teams treated over 125,000 children for malnutrition across seven hospitals and 65 community centers in Nigeria. We\u2019ve also trained community health workers to bring care directly to families. Using a color-coded measuring tape, they can diagnose children with malnutrition and treat them using a nutritional peanut paste. One clinic is facing the threat of closure while also servicing an uptick in clients due to severe flooding. Mashamari Stabilization Center admits on average 250 clients per month. During record flooding in Maiduguri last year, the clinic was entirely flooded, forcing IRC to evacuate staff and clients, keeping children attached to their ICU-like machines to ensure their survival. Learn more about how the IRC is addressing malnutrition in Nigeria. **Why do children with acute malnutrition go untreated?** Despite the existence of a simple, proven treatment, over 80% of children with acute malnutrition never receive care. Why? Barriers like conflict, underfunded health systems, and nowsevere U.S. aid cuts, prevent access to care. This is especially true in countries that grapple with severe humanitarian crises, includingAfghanistan,Gaza,NigeriaandSudan. Additionally, the traditional approach to treating malnutrition is overly complex and fragmented. It separates treatment for different forms of malnutrition and requires multiple visits to clinics that are far from home. The IRC is changing the way the world responds to malnutrition. Our streamlined approach to treating malnutrition brings effective care directly to communities and helps children survive. **U.S. aid cuts are impacting life-saving malnutrition programs** RecentU.S. aid cutsare jeopardizing malnutrition treatment programs around the world. These funding cuts are forcing essential nutrition programs to scale back or close in communities where humanitarian aid is often the only source of support. The consequences are especially severe for children suffering from the most severe forms of malnutrition. The IRC treats these children in ICU-like settings where even a momentary disruption to care can be threatening. These are probably the most vulnerable clients the IRC has around the world. Tragically, aid cuts will force the IRC to cut malnutrition support programs that support tens of thousands of children around the world.Urgent support is needed to keep these programs operating. **How can I help children with malnutrition?** The IRC is committed to saving lives. Our teams work tirelessly to deliver life-saving support in crisis-affected communities around the world\u2014but aid cuts and restrictive policies implemented by the Trump administration are impacting our work. The IRC urgently needs support to maintain our critical programming. Support the IRC as we help people in crisis to survive, recover and rebuild their lives. **Save a child's life** **Save a child's life** **What is the International Rescue Committee (IRC)?** TheInternational Rescue Committee (IRC)treats children experiencing acute malnutrition in 21 countries.
