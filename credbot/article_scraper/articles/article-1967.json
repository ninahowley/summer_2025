According to the report, three-quarters of teens say they've seen porn by age 17, and the average age of first exposure is just 12 years old. Within seconds, teens can access virtually any type of content from the palm of their hand, including porn. It\u2019s more accessible than ever before. Its normalization has made it part of teen culture. A report titled\u201cTeens and Pornography\u201d1. Robb, M.B., & Mann, S. (2023). Teens and pornography. San Francisco, CA: Common Sense.Copyput together by Common Sense includes data collected from teens 13-17 years old with various backgrounds. Of the teens surveyed, three-quarters said they had seen porn and that this exposure shapes how they view sex and sexual relationships. All participants who reported seeing porn said they were exposed by age 12.1. Robb, M.B., & Mann, S. (2023). Teens and pornography. San Francisco, CA: Common Sense.CopyAnother 15% said they saw it for the first time when they were 10 years old or younger.1. Robb, M.B., & Mann, S. (2023). Teens and pornography. San Francisco, CA: Common Sense.CopyMost teens (73%) reported that they have consumed pornography.1. Robb, M.B., & Mann, S. (2023). Teens and pornography. San Francisco, CA: Common Sense.CopyPornography used to be much more difficult to access. Today teens can access hardcore porn with one click. From the same report, of those who have seen online pornography, 44% of teens reported that they viewed it intentionally. In comparison, 58% said they viewed it accidentally, a majority saying their accidental encounter came from clicking a link, a search engine result, an online ad, or on social media in some way.Whether they want to see it or not, these teens, just 13-17 years old, often have no choice.Porn at schoolWhile these statistics regarding porn consumption are concerning, what\u2019s more alarming is how pornography, for many respondents, is part of the everyday school experience.Overall, 30% of all teens (41% of teens who said they had been exposed to pornography) reported that they had been exposed during the school day, most teens (60%) reported they saw it several times a month, and (40%) said they saw it at school weekly, some from school-issued devices.Related:Teens Watch Porn to Learn About Sex\u2014This Is What Porn Teaches ThemThese survey statistics further show that teens who attend private schools are almost twice as likely to be exposed to porn during school versus those in public schools.Pornography has so profoundly infiltrated teen culture that it\u2019s become just part of the everyday school experience. We know kids are accessing more pornography at school than ever before, but we have yet to scratch the surface of what the consequences of viewing this type of content at school could mean. How is pornography impacting learning, and how is it altering school safety and culture?If you are a parent, educator, or administrator seeking a solution in your circle for this ever-growing issue, we invite you to consider ourage-appropriate live presentation program.Teens mixed feelings toward pornWhile most teens report that they\u2019ve seen porn, responses regarding their overall attitude and feelings surrounding porn conflicted. Most teens said that they feel \u201cOK\u201d about how much porn they watch (67%), but half also reported feeling \u201cguilty or ashamed\u201d after watching porn.As we know, shame is never productive when discussing porn, and it\u2019s apparent in this report it does nothing to dissuade someone from consuming porn.Even more concerning is that 67% of those who reported seeing porn by accident said they feel guilty or ashamed for seeing porn, even though it wasn\u2019t their fault. Often this shame is a result of a lack of healthy conversations surrounding pornography.Related:Oral Before Kissing: Porn Culture Has Changed Teens\u2019 First Sexual EncountersHow porn harmsBesides feeling unhealthy feelings of shame, this report revealed that the top reason teens intentionally consumed porn was that they thought porn could better help them understand their sexual preferences.About half, 45%, of the participants said that pornography gives helpful information about sex, and another 45% said they watch to \u201cfind out what arouses and excites them.\u201dRespondents also said they have also learned via porn \u201chow to have sex\u201d (79%), \u201cabout human bodies and anatomy\u201d (79%), and the \u201ctypes of behaviors \u2026 likely to feel pleasurable\u201d (73%) and \u201cnot pleasurable\u201d (60%) to a partner.That\u2019s concerning\u2014especially considering how toxic and harmful porn can be. One 2021 study, for example, found that at least 1 in 3 and as many as 9 in 10 porn videos show sexual violence oraggression.2. Vera-Gray, F., McGlynn, C., Kureshi, I., & Butterby, K. (2021).

Additionally, just 1 in 3 reported seeing someone ask for consent before engaging in sexual activity.So while teens are turning to porn to learn about sex, instead, they are learning unhealthy, unrealistic toxic views on sex, but there\u2019s more.Respondents also reported viewing racial and ethnic stereotypes in pornography. Over 50% said they encountered pornography depicting Black people in a stereotypical way \u201coften\u201d or \u201csometimes,\u201d and many reported seeing pornography stereotypes when portraying Latino/a/x people (50%), Asian people (46%), and Middle Eastern people (26%). Additionally, more than 50% report seeing porn that shows stereotypical displays of gender and sexual orientation.In addition to fostering dangerous views on sex and tolerance for discrimination, violence, and racism, we know through years of academic research pornography\u2019s impact on mental health, relationships, and society, including fueling the demand for sex trafficking.Related:Can Watching Porn Negatively Impact Mental Health?Flipping the scriptLess than half of the teens included in this survey said they\u2019ve had a conversation about pornography with a trusted adult.
