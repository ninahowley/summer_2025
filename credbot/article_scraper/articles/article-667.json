used ambiguous poll results to create a \u201cpublic opinion\u201d that conforms to his world view. **How NYT Columnist Ross Douthat used ambiguous poll results to create a \u201cpublic opinion\u201d that conforms to his world view.** Tags:Media Polls,U.S. Submit a tip (Credit: http://nyphotographic.com/) In July 2020,the Cato Institute, described as a Libertarian think tank, released the resultsof its own pollfocusing on the issue of self-censorship. In an article this month comparing life in Hungary to the U.S.,New York Timescolumnist Ross Douthatused those year-old resultsto support his contention that \u201can important part of American life right now\u201d is the fear that \u201cprogressivism already exerts this power \u2013 to make its critics fear for their livelihood.\u201d* There is nothing in the poll, however, that would substantiate his claim. His article is an example of how pollsters and pundits can use vague or ambiguous poll results to manufacture the illusion of a public opinion they prefer. **The Cato Poll** According to the poll, \u201c62% of Americans say the political climate these days prevents them from saying things they believe because others might find them offensive.\u201d Another question in the poll, cited by Douthat, found that \u201cNearly a third (32%) of employed Americans say they personally are worried about missing out on career opportunities or losing their job if their political opinions became known.\u201d It\u2019s important to note that the poll itself does not ask any follow-up questions as to why respondents felt the way they did. The first poll question does ask if the \u201cpolitical climate these days\u201d caused people to be self-censorious, but there is no definition of what either the pollsters or the respondents meant by that phrase. **Douthat\u2019s Interpretations of the Poll Results** The very ambiguity allows Douthat to fill in the blanks with his own interpretation as to why people might be cautious about expressing their views in public. To support his contention that Americans are fearful of progressivism, he asserts: \u201cYou can document this fear of sharing strong opinions,especially ones that conflict with progressive orthodoxy, by looking at opinion polls. (Italics added) \u201cFor example, a 2020surveyconducted by the Cato Institute found that 62 percent of Americans felt uncomfortable sharing their views because of the political climate, and \u2018strong liberals\u2019 were the only ideological group where the majority felt free to speak their minds. \u201cTo the question, \u2018Are you worried about losing your job or missing out on job opportunities if your political opinions became known?\u2019 highly educated Americans were the most anxious, with 44 percent of respondents with a postgraduate degree and 60 percent of Republicans with a post-grad degree saying yes.\u201d That is it for the poll evidence. The logic Douthat implies: Because Republicans and conservatives reported being more constrained than Democrats and liberals in speaking out, Republicans and conservatives must be fearful of liberal orthodoxy. But there is nothing in the poll that explicitly mentions progressive orthodoxy. That addition is simply a creation of Douthat\u2019s own mind. **Alternative Interpretations** There could be many other factors that caused people to be cautious in expressing their opinions. The poll explicitly mentions the \u201cpolitical climate\u201d as the environment that produces the caution. Douthat seems to believe the political climate was indeed progressive orthodoxy. But that view is unlikely to have been the dominant one for the general public in the summer of 2020 when the poll was conducted and released. One could argue, for example, that the most contentious events constituting the political climate in the early summer of 2020 were thepandemic, protests againstthe killing of George Floyd, and the ongoingconcerns about climate change. On all three issues, Republicans were widely split \u2013 many Republicanscritical of Trump\u2019s handling of the pandemic, many Republican leaders joining Democrats incriticizing Trump\u2019s incendiary languageagainst the protesters, and a significant number of GOP leaders who called themselvesnever Trumpersout campaigning strongly against their own party\u2019s president. For a president whodemanded absolute loyalty, the ongoing GOP internecine warfare could be one reason why rank-and-file conservatives and Republicans indicated they were especially cautious in speaking out freely. Perhaps they weren\u2019t afraid of liberals as much as they were afraid of saying things that would contradict their own party\u2019s president and his vehement supporters. We do not know, however, what the actual reason is because the Cato Institute poll did not ask. As for the second question, people worrying about losing their jobs, Douthat notes that the \u201chighly educated Americans were the most anxious,\u201d including 60% of Republicans with a post-grad degree. But what does that indicate? It says nothing about these Republicans being concerned about progressive orthodoxy. In fact, it\u2019s possible the most educated Republicans were also the most likely to be afraid to express their opinions at work because they realized how polarized their own party had become over Trump\u2019s positions on Covid, protesters, and climate change. Let me be clear: I am not arguing that the above explanations are the correct ones. I\u2019m just pointing out that with ambiguous poll data, one can spin almost any scenario to support one partisan position or another. What I\u2019ve outlined is sheer partisan speculation, not supported by the poll any more than is the partisan speculation proffered by Douthat. It\u2019s also important to acknowledge that there may be other explanations for why various groups are cautious in stating their opinions, having nothing to do with politics. It could be that typically conservatives are more restrained in this area than are liberals. The difference could have to do with the personality differences between the two groups, not related specifically to culture or politics. Also, perhaps Republicans \u2013 especially the most highly educated workers \u2013 are more likely to be guarded in talking freely while on the job because they are disproportionately more likely to work in businesses/corporations, where people can be fired at will, while Democrats and liberals are more likely to work in academe, the government, or non-profit organizations, where some form of tenure protects free speech. There are many other hypotheses that could be researched. The Cato poll did not explore any of them. What we can conclude from the Cato poll is that it provides no evidence for the assertion that the public is especially afraid of sharing strong opinions \u201cthat conflict with progressive orthodoxy,\u201d despite what Ross Douthat\u2019s column argues. ____________________ *The quotation I cite has been condensed, but I believe it accurately conveys Douthat\u2019s view. Here is the full paragraph from which I condensed his quotation:\u201cThis is a useful tweet for thinking about the fears motivating Hungary-watching Americans, left and right. On the one hand, there\u2019s the fear that Trumpian populism will someday gain enough power to make its critics fear for their livelihoods. On the other, there\u2019s the fear that progressivism already exerts this power in the United States, and that what Frum describes in dire terms, the cautioussotto voceconversation, is an important part of American life right now.\u201d Tags:Media Polls,U.S. Submit a tip Report an Error| **Submit a tip / Report a problem** Your NameFirst Your Email* Comments *Please check this box to accept theTerms & Conditionsof our website Please check this box to accept theTerms & Conditionsof our website Please check this box to accept theTerms & Conditionsof our website CAPTCHA \u0394 Share this article: **Get our weekly newsletter** * **Related Articles** UK Sun reporter Anthony France\u2019s conviction for paying police overturned Kenyan\u2019s Nation Didn\u2019t Ask Police to Pay to Squash Negative Bribery Story, Freelancer Fired Chris Pharo, Jamie Pyatt Cleared of Bribery News of the World\u2019s Ryan Sabey\u2019s Conviction for Paying Prince Harry Soldier Thrown out Journalist Beth Knobel on Russian Journalists Protesting Consumer Confidence Is Up!
