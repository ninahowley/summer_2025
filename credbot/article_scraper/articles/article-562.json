Considering this, the present study was undertaken to access the floristic composition and diversity of Shorea robusta dominated stands in the Paonta Forest Range of Himachal Pradesh. Sample plots of 0.1 ha were laid out (systematic random sampling) in in seven compartments which recorded 33 genera with 34 species belonging to 26 families. The results revealed that the flora of compartments catalogued with Lai C28 had the maximum (9) tree species, Kukron C15 and Rajban C10 had the maximum shrub species and Rajban C6 and Rajban C7 had maximum herb species among all the compartments. S. robusta was the dominant species with IVI varied between 126.72 and 156.59 in the compartments. The similarity index of trees in compartments ranged from 0.67 to 1.00. Rajban C6 and Rajban C7 had the maximum similarity index. This research focused on documenting the diversity of plants within the Sal Forest of Himachal Pradesh, India, produced valuable scientific data and a fundamental understanding for the conservation of the biodiversity and sustainable management.
