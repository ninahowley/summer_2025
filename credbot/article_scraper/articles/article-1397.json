The party wants higher requirements for foreigners from \u201cMenapt\u201d countries \u2013 meaning the Middle East, North Africa, Pakistan, and Turkey \u2013 to enter the Danish labour market. Specifically, the Conservatives want a higher wage threshold on job offers for people from these countries, relative to other non-EU countries, for them to qualify for a work permit. \u201cThere\u2019s been a lack of recognition that those who arrive here as much-needed labour can end up becoming an integration challenge,\u201d the party\u2019s political spokesperson, Mette Abildgaard, told newspaper Berlingske in aninterviewearlier this month. \u201cWe have to be honest and acknowledge that what may be in the short-term interest of businesses is not necessarily in Denmark\u2019s long-term interest,\u201d Abildgaard said. READ ALSO: Danish Conservatives want stricter work permit rules for Muslim countries INTERVIEW: 'There's no need to restrict international labour coming to Denmark' **Advertisement** We asked people from Muslim countries who have moved to Denmark for work reasons for their thoughts. \u201cI don\u2019t see any difference compared to my other foreign colleagues,\u201d a reader from Morocco, who works in marketing in Copenhagen, said in response to our survey. A reader from Turkey, who also asked not to be named, said that they had moved to Denmark after accepting a job offer as a software engineer. \u201cAlthough the immigration process differs for EU citizens, I can only describe my own experience as a Turkish newcomer,\u201d they said. \u201cFrom my early days, I noticed that some Danes \u2013 often those with limited exposure to other cultures \u2013 tend to bundle everyone from the Middle East or Turkey into the same set of stereotypes,\u201d they explained. \u201cBecause Denmark is a small and relatively homogeneous society, it can be harder for those people to recognise the nuance and diversity that exist within other nations,\u201d they also said. **Advertisement** \u201cOne example: for an \u2018outdoor teambuilding day\u2019 at work, we were told to bring clothes suitable for rain. I dressed accordingly. My HR representative \u2013 who might be expected to be especially sensitive \u2013 remarked, \u201cYou look like a Dane,\u201d as if it were a compliment. The irony is that every item I wore that day, I owned them and used them daily in Turkey,\u201d they said. This is \u201cnot a problem with Danes in general\u201d, they added. Ahmed, a PhD graduate from Pakistan who works in Aalborg, got in touch to comment on the process of being approved for a work permit. \u201cThe process was very long even though I am a specialist in my domain. I felt that I am being punished for getting a job offer,\u201d he said. Engineer Muhammad, from Pakistan and currently living in Jutland, said he felt his experience as a person from a 'Menapt' country who came to Denmark because of a job offer was not different compared to people from other regions. \u201cAll my employers have been very happy with my work and culture. I do not think that any religious background impedes integration into Danish society or workplaces,\u201d he said. S. Kasim, who comes from Pakistan and works in the legal sector, said they felt political rhetoric had resulted in a change in public sentiment towards Muslim workers. **Advertisement** \u201cI can\u2019t talk about experiences of others from other countries. I know that I was welcome initially but as the government started the Muslim bashing I saw the changes in the attitudes of the people around me,\u201d they wrote. Meanwhile, Nazmul from Bangladesh, who lives in Sob\u00f8rg and works in hospitality, said \u201cI haven't faced any problem for being a Muslim or practicing my religion in my workplace.\u201d READ ALSO:Foreign workers in Denmark 'more likely' to have substandard working conditions A number of others also described their experiences joining the Danish labour market as \u201cproblem-free\u201d or \u201cfine\u201d. \u201cI had absolutely no problem integrating with the Danish society. I am learning the language and trying to understand the societal values, the cultural norms, rules, etc,\u201d wrote an Egyptian marketing and communications professional who lives in Copenhagen. \u201cIn many ways, I am more aligned with the societal values here, such as equality and freedom of speech, than I was in my home country,\u201d they said. \u201cIt's harder to make Danish friends for sure, but I've heard the same from European expats, too. Perhaps what's challenging is the stereotypes many people have about expats coming from the Middle East,\u201d they said, adding that \u201cwe're much more diverse in reality.\u201d \u2018T\u2019, a student from Bangladesh who currently lives in Copenhagen and works part time as a housekeeper, said they had \u201cnot faced any difficulties\u201d in the workplace, although \u201csome old people are racist towards women wearing the hijab.\u201d Although she has a degree in economics, Abir from Bangladesh said she is currently working in Denmark as a cleaning assistant. \u201cI did not feel any racism face to face, but it was hard to get a job (but) that's because I don't know Danish yet,\u201d Abir wrote. **More** **Comments** Join the conversation in our comments section below.Share your own views and experience and if you have a question or suggestion for our journalists then email us atnews@thelocal.dk.Please keep comments civil, constructive and on topic \u2013 and make sure to read ourterms of usebefore getting involved.
