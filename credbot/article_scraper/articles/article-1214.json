STR/AFP/Getty Images **AMPLIFYING ANTHROPOLOGY** This article was originally published atThe Conversationand has been republished under Creative Commons. Generative artificial intelligenceis often seen as the epitome of our times and sometimes even as futuristic. We can use it to invent new art or technology, analyze emerging data, or simulate people, places, and things. But interestingly, it is also having an impact on how we view the past. AI imagery has already been used to illustrate popular articles, such ascovering scientific discoveries about Neanderthals. It was employed toanimate the Mesolithic period(from about 9,000 to 4,300 years ago) in a museum. TikTok users have adopted it to make realistic short videos about archaeology and history. It\u2019s even been used in aTV documentary about Stonehenge. Yet there are many issues with using AI imagery in archaeology\u2014some of which are also found more broadly within generative AI use. These include its environmental impact and the violation of intellectual property (using training data created by humans). But others are more specific to archaeology. As an academic who has worked extensively on \u201cresurrecting\u201d the past through digital technology, I believe generative AI has both fascinating potential and enormous risk for archaeological misrepresentation. Generative AI has the potential to conceptually bridge millennia\u2014but using it comes with risks. AI-generated Image inCanva/The Conversation Even before the use of AI, it was widely accepted within archaeology that visualizations of the past are highly fraught and should be treated with extreme caution. For example, archaeologist Stephanie Moserexamined 550 reconstructionspublished in academic and popular texts on human evolution. Her review found highly biased depictions, such as only males hunting, making art and tools, and performing rituals, while women were in more passive roles. A similar study by Diane Gifford-Gonzalezrevealed that\u201cnot one of 231 depictions of prehistoric males shows a man touching a child, woman, or an older person of either sex \u2026 no child is ever shown doing useful work.\u201d These reconstructions do not reflect scientists\u2019 nuanced understanding of the past. We know humans organized themselvesin an incredible array of variety, with a multitude of gender roles and self-expression. **ONE GREAT STORY EVERY DAY** A recent DNA-based study, for example, showed that women were actuallyat the center of societiesin Iron Age Britain. The stakes of representation in archaeology are high. For example, the hotly debated,dark-skinned reconstructionof \u201cCheddar Man,\u201d originally found in Southwest England, wasbased on ancient DNA analysis. It made headlines for disrupting the perception that all human ancestors in the north were light skinned. This and similar controversies reveal the iconic power of reconstructions, their political implications, and their ability to shape our understanding of the past. While the Cheddar Man reconstruction demonstrates that research is iterative, such reconstructions are sticky. They have profound visual legacies and are not easily supplanted when new data become available. Based on the shape of his skull and DNA analysis, scholars at the Natural History Museum in London created this new reconstruction of the so-called Cheddar Man. Werner Ustorf/CC BY-SA 4.0/Wikimedia This is exacerbated as they are incorporated into generative AI datasets. Beyond the use of outmoded data, generative AI visualizations of the pastcan be extremely poor. Even when more plausible details are included, they can be seamlessly integrated with other highly inaccurate elements. For example, it is impossible for viewers to disentangle the data-led from the so-called hallucinations (mistakes) produced by AI. Highlighting uncertainty is of central importance and concern among archaeologists. Archaeological illustrator Simon James noted that reconstruction artists have usedstrategically placed clouds of smoketo obscure unknown elements. As a digital archaeologist, I have made virtual reconstructions of many different sites and subjects. I know there is often estimation and guesswork involved in making holistic representations. Indeed, photorealistic accuracy is not alwaysthe paramount considerationin visualization\u2014particularly when exploring different hypotheses or addressing young audiences. But knowing what is backed by archaeological data and what is more speculative is key for authentic visual communication. **THE DANGERS OF PSEUDOARCHAEOLOGY** This is particularly important at a time when pseudoarchaeology is increasingly prevalent in popular media, such as theAncient Apocalypseshow on Netflix. The celebrity host and author Graham Hancock asserts there was a lost ice age civilization of Atlantis that had advanced technology. But this claim has beenthoroughly repudiated by archaeologists. Arguably, hoaxes will be much easier to perpetuate using generative AI. Beyond the high potential for misinformation about archaeology, the use of generative AI for archaeological visualizations can actually be harmful for archaeological knowledge production. My researchhas shownthat crafting reconstructions and illustrations in archaeology is incredibly important for understanding and interpreting the past. Creating visualizations based on science\u2014and indeedsoundscapes,smellscapes, and other interpretations based on multiple senses\u2014is very helpful for generating new questions. DONATE HERE Drawing allows archaeologists tocreate more detailed mental modelsand therefore a better understanding of archaeological remains. By delegating this creation to AI, archaeologists lose a powerful tool for knowledge generation. Moreover, my collaborative work with artists has demonstrated the intriguing possibilities that creative approaches open up to tell new stories about the past. Even with all of these problems, Iencourage an engaged, critical, applied approachto understanding the impact of digital technologies on investigations of the past. And this includes exploring the uses of generative AI for archaeological visualization. Archaeologists and nonspecialists are able to leverage generative AI to creatively produce interpretive media. Indeed, some archaeologists are already exploring AI to generate hypotheses about ancient life. And we are teaching critical uses of AI to our archaeology students. But what remains imperative is that archaeologists engage with and critique all visualizations\u2014both those created by generative AI and those made using other media.
