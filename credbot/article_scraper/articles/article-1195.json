In late May, contracted surveyors began staking property lines so the Town of Canmore can determine whether some of the fruit trees fall on private or public property. At times, fruit trees that appear to be on private property may actually be on public road rights-of-way. Town of Canmore officials say they are taking an extra step to make sure fruit trees that were previously identified as a public tree during a 2018 fruit tree inventory are indeed on municipally owned land before chopping any down. \u201cThe staking that folks are seeing in what appears to be the front lawn is just the land survey, which was done to identify the property line so that we could determine if the tree was a public or private tree,\u201d said Caitlin Van Gaal, supervisor of sustainability for the Town of Canmore. \u201cIn some cases, the tree was too close to the property to be able to be sure and so we wanted to confirm that it was, in fact, a public tree before we take any additional steps \u2026 we dropped a letter off to those homes indicating that a land survey would be taking place over the next week.\u201d This work in Cougar Creek neighbourhoods is the second year of a multi-year plan to remove fruit-bearing trees from municipal lands in order to reduce attractants that may draw bears into town in search of an easy, calorie-rich snack. Van Gaal said not all of the land surveys have come back yet. \u201cOnce that is all sent back to the Town, which we\u2019re hoping will be later this week, we will then be able to determine which trees are public trees,\u201d she said. At that point, those trees on public land would be tagged for removal and a letter would be sent to residents that an arborist would remove the tree. \u201cBefore he removes any tree, he will verify that it is, in fact, a fruit-bearing tree as there are some trees that are sterile and are just a flowering tree that do not produce fruit,\u201d said Van Gaal. \u201cWe want to confirm that we are just taking down the fruit-bearing trees.\u201d Town of Canmore officials say they appreciate trees are important to the community, noting trees often have sentimental or emotional value, contribute to placemaking and memories, and can be legacy trees from family members who are no longer here. \u201cWe know folks are attached to their trees. They\u2019re beautiful, they provide shade, they may have a sentimental attachment, or they were planted by a loved one \u2013 and we don't take that lightly,\u201d said Van Gaal. That said, removing fruit trees from the community is one of the key recommendations that came out of the human-wildlife coexistence implementation and action plan. Van Gaal said the program is about removing wildlife attractants, which residents have also told the municipality is a top priority, so as not to draw wildlife into town. \u201cThe point of removing the fruit-bearing trees is to ensure that we do not give wildlife an attractant or a reason to stop as they move through,\u201d she said. \u201cIf a bear is attracted to a fruit tree, they\u2019re more likely to hang around that area for a while. They\u2019re more likely to return to that area. We\u2019re more likely to have a human-wildlife coexistence encounter.\u201d With a keen sense of smell, opportunistic bears sniff out human food, garbage, bird seed, pet food, greasy barbecues and calorie-rich fruit trees. Bears eating fruit from trees is one of the main causes of bear relocation, or death as a result of a management action, in the Bow Valley. \u201cWe have seen over the years that a bear that gets into a fruit tree and returns to a fruit tree time after time, or then gets into other attractants such as garbage, is more likely to be taken out of town on the back of a trailer and relocated to another area,\u201d said Van Gaal. \u201cThe relocation success rate, as I understand it, can be quite low and so it can be quite detrimental to the bear to be relocated from Canmore.\u201dThe Town of Canmore also has a fruit tree removal incentive program, which covers 100 per cent of the cost of removing fruit trees or bushes up to $500 per private property. In addition, condos or commercial properties with five or more trees are also eligible for additional support of up to $1,000 per property this year. With a rollover from last year\u2019s budget, the pot of money for the 2025 program is about $40,000 for the fruit-tree removal program. \u201cBecause we do have a larger pot of money this year, and there's still plenty of funds remaining, there shouldn\u2019t be any issue with folks getting the incentive,\u201d said Van Gaal.
