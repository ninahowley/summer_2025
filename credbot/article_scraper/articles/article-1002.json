My family lives in Onehunga. This week\u2019s new figures show our home\u2019s rateable valuation is down 8 percent on 2021, yet our rates will rise about 5.8 percent ($315) from July 1. Add to that a 7.2 percent hike to Watercare charges, and it\u2019s costly. (Not everybody\u2019s valuation has diminished. For instance \u2013 and for the property voyeurs among us \u2013 the capital value of the Mowbray mansion in Coatesville has increased 3 percent, from $39.3 million to $40.5m. The CV for the former Hotchin mansion in \u014cr\u0101kei has jumped from $58m to $72.5m.) **read more** **Denser housing coming for Auckland, but not (necessarily) in your back yard** **The real reason Meridian shut down its grand green hydrogen project** On average, Aucklanders\u2019 CVs have dropped 9 percent. And while Auckland\u2019s cries may echo loudest, because there are more of us, the discrepancies are even more stark elsewhere in the country. Wellington residents, for instance, will pay on average 16.9 percent more in rates, even though their property values have dropped 24.4 percent \u2013 a big chunk out of their wealth that will push some into negative equity (on the books, at least). Nelson locals face a 6.5 percent rates rise, despite their house values dropping 9.4 percent. Understandably, homeowners\u2019 realisations that they are are less wealthy, yet they\u2019re being asked to pay more, will harden opposition to rates rises. And that will shape the political debate in October\u2019s local elections. Christopher Luxon\u2019s Government has told councils to \u201cget back to the basics\u201d of fixing pipes, filling potholes, and delivering core local services. Start your day informed.

Challenger local candidates who promise to rein in rates rises will no doubt get a more sympathetic hearing from local electors; those incumbents who are aware just how hard that is will struggle make their arguments heard. But let\u2019s set aside some of the spin and look at this more dispassionately. **Rates hikes v residential property valuation changes** The ways in which central government taxes and local government rates are set are critically different. Central government starts with tax rates (PAYE, company tax, GST, etc) then asks revenue officials to make an informed guess about what that rate will raise. If my gross earnings increase, I pay more tax \u2013 but generally I don\u2019t complain too much because I can see it\u2019s a consistent rate. Every year, as individual and company earnings and expenditure increase, the Government takes a bigger clip from a bigger ticket \u2013 and that helps cover its increased costs servicing a growing population. What this means is that the Government increases its tax take every year, without having to make any active decision. The passing of the Budget Appropriation Bill does not require MPs to vote on increasing tax revenue. MPs don\u2019t face the wrath of those who elected them, for voting in favour of a tax revenue rise. It just happens. Every year. Local government is required to work the other way round. It predicts how much money it will need to service its own growing population, then works backwards to decide how big an increase in rates revenues is needed to pay for that. What this means is that when your house value rises, increasing your equity and making you more wealthy, that doesn\u2019t flow through to paying more rates. All it does is slightly change the share you pay of your city or district\u2019s total rates bill, relative to your neighbour whose house value may have declined. The net effect is that over the past century, tax increases have massively outstripped rates rises, leaving local government genuinely struggling to pay the bills. **Tax v rates as a percentage of GDP** That\u2019s why Auckland Mayor Wayne Brown, this week, is putting the hard word on the Government to allow the city to charge bed taxes to fund tourism infrastructure. That\u2019s why Local Government NZ and its members (61 of the country\u2019s 67 city and district councils) have been pushing for new revenue tools, like a share of local GST take, or the ability to charge rates on Crown estate. That\u2019s right, even though the Government\u2019s books are in a much healthier state than councils\u2019, and its debt is lower by global measures, it still exempts itself from paying rates. So, as the local government elections roll around in October, by all means hold your councillors to account on their spending and the rates rises they\u2019ve imposed \u2013 but listen cautiously to MPs who punch down on cash-strapped councils. Be sure you\u2019re comparing apples with apples \u2013 because the big picture is, successive governments have increased their tax take far faster than councils have hiked their rates. **Jonathan MilneManaging editor** Newsroom Pro managing editor Jonathan Milne writes on economics, infrastructure, business and politics, and pens the daily 8 Things subscriber newsletter.More by Jonathan Milne **Join the Conversation** 4 Comments John Burnssays:11/06/2025 at 7:04 amAuckland house prices may have dropped 9% from 2021 -2025, but they had previously increased by 35% from 2016-2021.

Stands to reason that properties further out should be subject to further rates (although this is of course not the basis on which they\u2019re calculated).Log in to Reply Presumably the cost of delivering services increases the further out from the centre you get.
