With its ability to reach temperatures as high as 400\u00b0C, this oven brings the heat required to replicate the conditions of a traditional Neapolitan pizzeria\u2014right on your countertop. It offers both manual and assisted cooking modes tailored to different pizza styles. Design and Build Retailing at \u20ac829, the Smart Oven Pizzaiolo combines functionality with aesthetic appeal. Its stainless steel exterior sports a sleek retro look, making it an easy fit in any modern kitchen. What sets it apart, however, is its outdoor compatibility. Built to withstand the elements, it can be used comfortably on a terrace or patio without worry. Despite its compact size, this oven delivers a high-end experience. It features independently controlled heating elements at the top and bottom, allowing precise control over the baking process. Users can select from pre-set cooking programs based on the style of pizza they\u2019re aiming for\u2014whether it\u2019s thin-crust, New York-style, or classic Neapolitan\u2014or manually adjust the temperature and heat distribution to suit personal preferences. Performance and Features The Pizzaiolo is equipped with a 30 cm (approximately 12-inch) pizza stone made from refractory material that ensures optimal heat retention. In testing, it lived up to its promise of high-temperature cooking, reaching 400\u00b0C quickly and maintaining consistent heat throughout most of the surface\u2014though it showed a slight drop-off in temperature near the front of the stone, which may affect evenness if pizzas are not rotated during cooking. The oven also includes a dedicated pan, which adds versatility. This pan allows for baking thicker pizzas or preparing roasted vegetables and small meat dishes, making the Pizzaiolo more than just a one-trick appliance. User Experience While the oven excels in functionality, the control interface might take some getting used to. The labeling and mode selection could potentially confuse first-time users, but with a bit of practice, the interface becomes manageable. The glass door is a welcome touch, letting users keep an eye on their pizza without opening the oven and disrupting the heat. **Related Articles** **iPhone 13 Pro Max vs iPhone 12 Pro Max: Key Differences and What You Need to Know** The iPhone 13 Pro Max and its predecessor, the iPhone 12 Pro Max, may appear strikingly similar on the surface, but several key upgrades make the newer model a much more powerful device.
