The raids \u2014 at homes in Ann Arbor, Ypsilanti and Canton \u2014 were not tied to immigration issues or on-campus demonstrations against Israel that have taken place over the last year and a half, according to a spokesman for Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel. \u201cThese search warrants were not investigative of protest activity on the campus of the University of Michigan nor the Diag encampment,\u201d the spokesman, Danny Wimmer, said in a statement, referring to the location of Michigan\u2019s pro-Palestinian student encampment last year. \u201cToday\u2019s search warrants are in furtherance of our investigation into multi-jurisdictional acts of vandalism.\u201d The raids \u2014 during which some people were detained but not arrested \u2014 follow acts of vandalism at the homes of members of the University of Michigan\u2019s Board of Regents, whom pro-Palestinian activists want to cut university ties with Israel. Nessel\u2019s office provided a list of the vandalism incidents the raids were investigating. The incidents included one in December, when a group of protesters threw rocks through the window of Jordan Acker, a Jewish regent, while he and his children were home in the heavily Jewish Detroit suburb of Huntington Woods, and left pro-Palestinian graffiti on his car. Another incident from June 2024 targeted Acker\u2019s law office. Non-Jewish regents at the university, and the university president, have also been targeted by protesters in their own homes. Another incident, on the one-year anniversary of the Oct. 7 attacks, targeted the Jewish Federation of Metropolitan Detroit in Bloomfield Hills with graffiti reading \u201cIntifada\u201d and \u201cF**k Israel.\u201d Other graffiti, targeting a predominantly Jewish country club, made explicit references to Friends of the Israel Defense Forces, which had hosted an event at the space the day before. The oldest incidents dated back to February 2024; the most recent occurred in March of this year. A viral video showed officers breaking down the door of a home. Nessel\u2019s office, on Thursday, said officers broke down the door \u201cfollowing more than an hour of police efforts to negotiate entry to satisfy the court-authorized search warrant.\u201d Pro-Palestinian activists at the university have been engaged in extreme tactics to pressure its leadership to divest from Israel. Acker declined to comment on the raids Wednesday. He previously called the targeting of his own home \u201cterrorism\u201d and \u201cKlan-like.\u201d The involvement of federal agents in investigating local vandalism is unusual. An attorney representing several University of Michigan protesters told the Detroit Free Press that she believed the raids showed that Nessel\u2019s office was collaborating with the Trump administration, which has cracked down on pro-Palestinian protesters and schools where they have been active and dispatched federal immigration authorities to arrest non-citizen student activists. \u201cEveryone who was raided has taken part in protest and has some relationship to the University of Michigan,\u201d said the attorney, Liz Jacob of the Sugar Law Center in Detroit. \u201cWe are totally convinced that, but for their viewpoints, these students would not have been targeted.\u201d On Instagram, a pro-Palestinian collective at the university said they were being targeted by \u201czionist state AG Dana Nessel,\u201d who they accused of working with Trump to \u201crepress pro-Palestinian speech.\u201d (Nessel is Jewish.) Online, other pro-Palestinian groups attempted to link the raids with the high-profile seizings of activists Mahmoud Khalil and Rumeysa Ozturk on other campuses. The University of Michigan, which has large Jewish and Arab American student populations, has taken more aggressive action against protesters since President Donald Trump\u2019s reelection. In February, it suspended a leading pro-Palestinian student group for two years, in part over its demonstration at a regent\u2019s home.
