She\u2019s doubling down and starring in two films both premiering at the American Black Film Festival. Deco tackled questions with Victoria and her rom-com co-stars. It was a touchdown. The American Black Film Festival is hitting Miami Beach next week with a variety of films. Victoria Rowell: \u201cI\u2019ve been to ABFF many times, and I\u2019m so excited to return 2025.\u201d And actress Victoria Rowell is bringing a twofer this time around. Michael Jai White (as Jack Frazier): \u201cWhy would you come here now? And disrupt my family? Victoria Rowell: \u201c\u2018The Secret Between Us\u2019 is a family drama. I mean, the mystery child shows up at the front door, and how this family deals with it. It\u2019s an amazing script.\u201d She plays Maxine in the film. Victoria Rowell: \u201cI\u2019m very, very grateful. I\u2019m still working here. Forty years in the business.\u201d Character in \u201cLove Offside\u201d: \u201cI just got you your first client: a rugby player.\u201d And she\u2019s Mommy in the Jamaican film \u201cLove Offside.\u201d Victoria Rowell: \u201cHow I come into the movie is, I play Judi [Johnson]\u2019s mom, and we are a medical legacy family, and she wants to try some innovative sports medicine techniques.\u201d Judi Johnson: \u201cBeing in a project that has hailed from Jamaica, especially with the components of the medicinal benefits that the land offers, it was one those things that was a full circle moment.\u201d In the movie, pulling a muscle can equal pulling on the heartstrings. The flick follows Judi Johnson, a physical therapist, who mixes herbal healing with love for a rugby player played by Mike Merrill. Mike Merrill: \u201cI don\u2019t think you want to miss this movie. I would say it\u2019s more romance, though. It\u2019s more romance. So much passion and love in this story, that is more of a romance to me.\u201d Judi Johnson: \u201cI think, with our characters, we are longing for love and security. I hope that it showcases to individuals who are so focused on work that love still exists in the unknown places.\u201d Judi Johnson (as Camille Hart): \u201cHi.\u201d For the island native, vibing with her co-star was a no-brainer. Judi Johnson: \u201cMike is a character. Mike is chemistry. OK, I don\u2019t think Mike cannot have chemistry with anyone.\u201d As for that dance you see in the movie, Mike says it was improvised. Mike Merrill: \u201cI actually don\u2019t know what that dance is called. That was the character, that was Ryan. I don\u2019t know where that came from, but it worked. So I did it the next time, later on in the movie.\u201d Both films premiere at ABFF next Friday, June 13.
