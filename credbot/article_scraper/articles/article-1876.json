Today, amid President Trump\u2019s use of militarized forces to silence dissent \u2014 this time over his immigration policies in Los Angeles \u2014 nonprofit watchdog American Oversightfiled suitagainst the administration for failing to release records regarding the military\u2019s involvement in immigration enforcement. In anticipation of the administration\u2019s eventual use of the military in service of its mass deportation goals and to quash opposition to Trump\u2019s political agenda, the group filed Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests for these documents in April. In addition to the lawsuit, American Oversight also launched a sweeping investigation into the administration\u2019s deployment of the National Guard and U.S. Marine Corps in Los Angeles. The militarized response, which came over the explicit objections of California officials, has raised serious legal and constitutional concerns \u2014 including potential violations of the Posse Comitatus Act. \u201cDeploying the military to quash protests over the administration\u2019s inhumane and legally dubious immigration policies \u2014 especially over the objection of elected state leaders \u2014 is a dangerous, though unfortunately predictable, escalation by the Trump administration. The military should never be used as a political weapon, full stop,\u201dsaid American Oversight Executive Director Chioma Chukwu. \u201cIf left unchecked, this abuse of power under thin legal pretense can be readily replicated across other states in the future. We won\u2019t stop until the administration provides a full legal justification for its actions. Americans have a right to know who authorized it, what rationale was offered, and not just whether the government crossed a line \u2014 but by how much that line has been obliterated.\u201d Thelawsuit filedtoday in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia targets the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for failing to release communications, legal directives, and agreements tied to military involvement in immigration enforcement as required under FOIA. In launching its investigation, American Oversight filed nearly three dozen expedited FOIA and California Public Records Act requests with federal, state, and local agencies, including the U.S. Departments of Justice, Defense, and Homeland Security; ICE; the U.S. Northern Command; the National Guard Bureau; the California Military Department; and the U.S. Marine Corps. The investigation seeks communications regarding the deployment and related protests, formal directives and policies regarding the use of military force for protest response, and any meeting records and internal dissent communications. The effort focuses on determining whether the federal government acted lawfully and transparently \u2014 or inappropriately escalated federal force to chill dissent against Trump\u2019s immigration policies. **Litigation** **American Oversight v.
