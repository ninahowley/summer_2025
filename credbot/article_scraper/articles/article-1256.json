Hsiang, the most recent Administrator of the United States Digital Service (USDS), led the organization through unprecedented growth \u2013 improving critical services and technological advances across more than two dozen agencies. During her tenure, USDS improved access to social security, simplified support for veterans\u2019 care and benefits, and launched the firstfree government tax filing toolfor 30 million Americans. During that time her team was estimated to have saved tens of billions of dollars and helped agencies shift toward long term strategic investments to dramatically improve their technology capabilities with higher user satisfaction, higher security, and at lower cost. Hsiang\u2019s tenure at USDS spanned three administrations and included leading transformational teams at the VA, the DOD, HHS, and the White House, staffed by top tier talent recruited directly from the private sector into public service. Before her public service, Hsiang was VP of Technology Products and Policy at Devoted Health, driving its growth into a 700+ employee multibillion dollar firm. She was the VP of new product development for Optum\u2019s analytics division, and prior to that was a venture investor and advisor across the healthcare and large-scale data system sectors, contributing to her robust background in both public and private sectors. Hsiang, who has a bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s in electrical and biomedical engineering from MIT and an MBA from Harvard Business School, will research how government capabilities, services, and public servants are communicated with the American public. She\u2019ll also be involved in the Shorenstein Center\u2019s new Unlocked series and research programs. The Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy is aHarvard Kennedy Schoolresearch center dedicated to exploring and illuminating the intersection of press, politics and public policy in theory and practice. The Center strives to bridge the gap between journalists and scholars, and between them and the public. **Follow us** ABOUT|CONTACT US|PRIVACY|ACCESSIBILITY|WEB ACCESSIBILITY Unless otherwise noted this site and its contents are licensed under aCreative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 Internationallicense."}
