There was the throwing error by starting pitcher Carson Glose in the second inning on a pickoff attempt that moved two runners up a base, allowing the game\u2019s first run to score shortly after on a sacrifice fly. There was also the hard-hit ball with the bases loaded in the bottom of the second from PJP second baseman Luca Dimaio that turned into a 4-6-3 double play. There were fly balls to the warning track and a missed tag by an umpire that extended the opponent\u2019s big inning that would come later. Then, as the little things started to pile up into one big thing, it started to become clear that the usually-reliable Golden Panthers were not going to survive this inopportunely bad day. \u201cIt was 1-0 going into the top of the fifth inning,\u201d said PJP head coach Charles Deluzio by phone Monday night, \u201cthen the wheels fell off the bus.\u201d The bus to the PIAA-4A semifinals took the Golden Panthers to North Schuylkill High School in Ashland on Monday to battle District 4 champion Montoursville. Red-hot PJP, which claimed the 4A district title and had won its first two games of the state tournament with relative ease, had hoped to ride its latest win streak to its first PIAA championship game appearance since 2014. But a five-run Montoursville fifth inning derailed that dream on Monday, as Warriors starting pitcher Logan Kirby kept the powerful PJP lineup off balance all day, firing a six-hit, complete-game shutout in a 6-0 Montoursville victory. The Warriors (20-4) will take on either District 3\u2019s East Pennsboro or District 7\u2019s Indiana in Friday\u2019s state title game at Penn State University. Two walks and the failed pickoff in the second slightly knocked Glose off his feet, but through four innings he had only allowed a total of one run, two walks and two hits. It was a ballgame, even if PJP (19-5) loaded the bases and coming away empty-handed in the second inning was not a harbinger of good things to come. After lashing double-digit hits in their previous three games, the Golden Panthers managed just six hits from three players. Everybody else was playing the guessing game against Kirby, who only struck out four but kept hitters off balance with crafty finesse. \u201cKirby was very good for them,\u201d Deluzio said. \u201cMid-80s fastball with a great slider and offspeed stuff that kept us off balance. We hit some balls hard, but they were more in the air than line drives. We played the right guys in our lineup \u2013 they just shut us down. Sometimes a good pitcher does that, and today was that day.\u201d With Kirby locked in and dealing, Montoursville dealt the fatal blow in the fifth inning. Brayden McCourt doubled to lead off the inning and got to third base on a bunt single from Michael Reeder. Royce Bowes\u2019 RBI single to right made it 2-0. A sacrifice bunt, intentional walk and fly out loaded the bases with two outs, but three consecutive RBI singles courtesy of Jimmy Mussina, Zack Neill and Jonah Heddings made it 6-0 Warriors before Glose could fully extinguish the blaze. \u201cThey grind out at-bats very well,\u201d Deluzio said. \u201cThey put it in play, bunted well, moved runners \u2013 that\u2019s a good baseball team. Carson had his slider over but they sat on his fastball and the next thing you know it\u2019s 5, 6-0. We hit some balls hard but didn\u2019t get the key hit when we needed it. All I can say is we were knocking on the door but couldn\u2019t kick it in. They were the better team today; we were loose and ready to play, but it just didn\u2019t materialize.\u201d PJP will sustain heavy losses to graduation in the form of nine seniors, though the exodus of left fielder Luke Terlesky, shortstop AJ Diaddezio, third baseman Chase Frantz, catcher Nik Deforge and second baseman Dimaio will be felt the most. Terlesky and Frantz accounted for five of the team\u2019s six hits on Monday and are PJP\u2019s strongest power hitters. Diaddezio went hitless but pitched two scoreless innings after Montoursville chased Glose from the game and is the team\u2019s leadoff hitter, starting shortstop and heartbeat. Dimaio is a strong defender at second base who vastly improved as a hitter this season, and Deforge was the starting catcher for a strong pitching staff. This senior core helped PJP log two district titles in 2023 and 2025 and advanced farther into the state tournament than any other baseball team at the school has in a decade. \u201cThose guys all played three or four years and turned the program around to where it\u2019s at,\u201d said Deluzio, who also praised assistants Jon Wowak and Zach Smiley for a job well done. \u201cReplacing AJ, Luke and Chase\u2019s bats will be tough, and I love this senior class \u2013 they\u2019ve been with me forever and play the game the right way. Those guys are some of my favorites ever.\u201d The return of juniors-to-be Glose and Tyler Tindall as the team\u2019s top two starting pitchers will help speed the re-acclimation project up, and both of those players also hit at the top or in the middle of the lineup. Blaise Desanto, Hunter Mishock and Sam Buckley all took steps forward this season and will be back, leaving Deluzio to believe that PJP has another strong two-year window of contention ahead of it. \u201cWe\u2019re ready to make a run again with Glose and Tindall and a couple of others who will step up,\u201d Deluzio said. \u201cWe have a good core coming back. I\u2019m ready to go again and can\u2019t wait to get started in January.\u201d Montoursville 6, Pope John Paul II 0 Montoursville 0 1 0 0 5 0 0 \u2013 6 9 0 Pope John Paul II 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2013 0 6 1 WP: Logan Kirby 7IP, 6H, 0R, BB, 4K LP: Carson Glose 5IP, 8H, 6ER, 3BB, K 2B: MV- Brayden McCourt; PJP- Chase Frantz **Share this:** Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Facebook Click to share on X (Opens in new window)X **Most Popular** Limerick man convicted of stalking, harassing girl he met in high schoolLimerick man convicted of stalking, harassing girl he met in high school **Limerick man convicted of stalking, harassing girl he met in high school** **Limerick man convicted of stalking, harassing girl he met in high school** Montgomery County Coroner releases identity of Schuylkill River drowning victimMontgomery County Coroner releases identity of Schuylkill River drowning victim **Montgomery County Coroner releases identity of Schuylkill River drowning victim** **Montgomery County Coroner releases identity of Schuylkill River drowning victim** Hebert chosen from among six for Pottsgrove School Board vacancyHebert chosen from among six for Pottsgrove School Board vacancy **Hebert chosen from among six for Pottsgrove School Board vacancy** **Hebert chosen from among six for Pottsgrove School Board vacancy** Wawa to open newest Montgomery County storeWawa to open newest Montgomery County store **Wawa to open newest Montgomery County store** **Wawa to open newest Montgomery County store** Pottstown Juneteenth celebration Saturday has \u2018family reunion\u2019 themePottstown Juneteenth celebration Saturday has \u2018family reunion\u2019 theme **Pottstown Juneteenth celebration Saturday has \u2018family reunion\u2019 theme** **Pottstown Juneteenth celebration Saturday has \u2018family reunion\u2019 theme** PIAA-6A SOFTBALL: Perkiomen Valley\u2019s 24-win season ends with 2-0 setback to Central Dauphin in state semifinalsPIAA-6A SOFTBALL: Perkiomen Valley\u2019s 24-win season ends with 2-0 setback to Central Dauphin in state semifinals **PIAA-6A SOFTBALL: Perkiomen Valley\u2019s 24-win season ends with 2-0 setback to Central Dauphin in state semifinals** **PIAA-6A SOFTBALL: Perkiomen Valley\u2019s 24-win season ends with 2-0 setback to Central Dauphin in state semifinals** Montgomery County food safety inspections found damaged floors and pooling waterMontgomery County food safety inspections found damaged floors and pooling water **Montgomery County food safety inspections found damaged floors and pooling water** **Montgomery County food safety inspections found damaged floors and pooling water** PIAA-4A BASEBALL: Pope John Paul II derailed by five-run fifth inning in season-ending loss to Montoursville in state semisPIAA-4A BASEBALL: Pope John Paul II derailed by five-run fifth inning in season-ending loss to Montoursville in state semis **PIAA-4A BASEBALL: Pope John Paul II derailed by five-run fifth inning in season-ending loss to Montoursville in state semis** **PIAA-4A BASEBALL: Pope John Paul II derailed by five-run fifth inning in season-ending loss to Montoursville in state semis** Norristown High School graduation honors immigration as opportunity through sacrifice [Photos]Norristown High School graduation honors immigration as opportunity through sacrifice [Photos] **Norristown High School graduation honors immigration as opportunity through sacrifice [Photos]** **Norristown High School graduation honors immigration as opportunity through sacrifice [Photos]** Owen J.
