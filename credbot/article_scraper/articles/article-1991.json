Batrice, described by The Times as a Palestinian-American activist and \u201cstrategist for progressive causes,\u201d and Israeli-American activist Lenkinski, argue that No Other Land is much more than a movie\u2014it\u2019s a \u201cstatement, a challenge, and an act of defiance.\u201d Batrice and Lenkinski argue that the film\u2019s Israeli and Palestinian creators are \u201cdefying the zero-sum logic that dominates the region\u201d by working together. Yet, as they acknowledge, No Other Land has faced criticism from both Israelis and Palestinians. Among the latter, the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) campaign condemned Palestinian activist Basel Adra for collaborating with Israeli filmmaker Yuval Abraham. According to Batrice and Lenkinski, this opposition has \u201cundermined the joint artistic work that directly criticizes the Israeli government.\u201d Oscar-winning Israeli journalist Yuval Abraham and Palestinian activist Basel Adra claim to show \u201clife under occupation\u201d in Masafer Yatta, yet their doc distorts the area\u2019s true history. When you start with a pre-written script, propaganda wins out over facts.pic.twitter.com/7z2vLjp2Ev \u2014 HonestReporting (@HonestReporting)March 7, 2025 This, ultimately, is the core message of their essay: No Other Land presents a model of collaboration in which Israeli activists align with Palestinian efforts to challenge Israel\u2019s existence\u2014what Batrice and Lenkinski euphemistically call \u201cco-resistance.\u201d It\u2019s a charming spin. After all, \u201cresistance\u201d is precisely the term Hamas uses for every suicide bombing and stabbing attack it orchestrates against Israeli civilians. Batrice and Lenkinski now attempt to repackage the term, stripping it of its violent connotations. See? Israelis are \u201cresisting\u201d too. It\u2019s non-violent. It\u2019s peaceful. It\u2019s art. \u201cIf there is any hope for the future, it lies precisely in these partnerships, in collaboration, and in what the filmmakers aptly call \u2018co-resistance,\u2019\u201d they write. There\u2019s just one problem. One of the essay\u2019s authors had a rather different interpretation of \u201cresistance\u201d on October 7, when Hamas terrorists, aided by Gazan civilians, invaded Israel, massacred over 1,200 people, and dragged 251 more back to Gaza as hostages. On that day\u2014the morning Israelis woke to hundreds of rockets and videos flooding social media of men, women, and children being hunted down, shot, stabbed, and bludgeoned\u2014Rania Batrice was busy amplifying Hamas propaganda. She shared footage of terrorists paragliding into Israel and opening fire, complete with a text overlay likening them to Jews smuggling weapons into Nazi ghettos during the Holocaust. Rania Batrice posted a video of Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7 attacks that described terrorists attacking civilians as \u201cresistance\u2026 invading illegal settlements housing illegal settlers.\u201d Now this \u201cprogressive\u201d Palestinian American activist is writing in@nytimes. \ud83e\uddf5pic.twitter.com/7COOZ5XMV7 \u2014 HonestReporting (@HonestReporting)March 17, 2025 And 24 hours later\u2014on October 8, when even the most committed apologists could no longer claim ignorance about the scale of the atrocities\u2014Batrice doubled down, declaring that anyone who described the attack as \u201cunprovoked\u201d was \u201cpart of the problem.\u201d The essay calls No Other Land a \u201cchallenge\u201d\u2014and in a way, that\u2019s true. It is certainly a challenge to take seriously a film thatdistorts decades of legal rulings and historical factsso thoroughly that its inclusion in the Academy\u2019s documentary category was an insult in itself. But the essay itself presents an even greater challenge: How does one reconcile its co-author\u2019s supposed belief in the unity of Israelis and Palestinians when on the day of the bloodiest massacre in Israeli history, she was celebrating?
