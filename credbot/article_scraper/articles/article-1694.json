Thanks to three brave Americans, we now know that Joe Biden has long misled the public about his involvement with his family\u2019sforeign business entanglementswhile he served as vice president. At considerable personal risk, former Biden family business partnersTony Bobulinskiand Bevan Cooney, and computer shop owner John Paul Mac Isaac, have come forward with tens of thousands of primary-source documents \u2014 internal corporate records, emails, and text messages \u2014 detailing years of business dealings that centered on trading on the Biden name. This material suggests that, despite Joe Biden\u2019s insistence that he knew nothing about his family\u2019s business deals, he was well aware of his son Hunter Biden\u2019s business ventures in China, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and elsewhere. These new troves constitute hard evidence of Biden family corruption, and confirm our reporting dating back to my close friend and colleague Peter Schweizer\u2019s 2018 book \u201cSecret Empires.\u201d In 2018, when Schweizer first broke the foreign influence scandals that have now engulfed the former vice president, it seemed apparent that China and Ukraine were not paying Biden\u2019s family members for their expertise, they were buying access to the vice president of the United States. This was never a scandal solely about Hunter or Joe\u2019s brothers, James and Frank. It was, and has always been, a Joe Biden scandal. For nearly three years, Biden and his surrogates have responded to the scandal with an increasingly unconvincing series of denials \u2014 including another from the former vice president in his last debate with President Trump. In response to \u201cSecret Empires,\u201d one ofJoe Biden\u2019s aides said\u201cwe aren\u2019t going to engage on a politically motivated hit pieces \u2026\u201d Team Biden did not bother to respond to specific allegations that the Biden family vacuumed up millions, in the exact locales where Biden was President Barack Obama\u2019s policy \u201cpoint man.\u201d When the issue re-emerged during the campaign, Team Biden continued to call it a \u201cconspiracy theory\u201d but this time, Joe Biden firmly put himself on record. \u201cI have never discussed with my son or my brother or anyone else anything having to do with their businesses \u2014 period,\u201d he told reporters in August 2019. \u201cI never talk with my son or my brother or anyone else in the distant family about their business interests, period.\u201d He repeated similar blanket denials on numerous occasions. These denials all proved to be untruthful. Period. We now know that Joe Bidenmet directlywith his son\u2019s Chinese business partner, Jonathan Li, in a Chinese hotel lobby on a fateful trip in 2013 (a trip that allowed Hunter to spend hours with his father, the vice president, on a transoceanic flight to Beijing aboard Air Force Two). Ten days later, Hunter landed an unprecedented $1 billion private equity deal, bankrolled by the Chinese government. But this was not the only meeting Joe Biden had with Biden family business partners. As the New York Post reported, emails on Hunter Biden\u2019s hard drive reveal that on April 16, 2015, Joe Biden met with a high-level official of a controversial Ukrainian energy company, Burisma, which had put Hunter on its board. And arecently unearthed photoshows that Vice President Bidenmet with Hunter\u2019s Kazakh business associatein Washington, DC. After first dismissing the gathering scandal as a \u201cconspiracy theory,\u201d the Biden team shifted to the position that Joe had never talked with his family about their business dealings, then shifted again to the position that he\u2019d never met with his family\u2019s business partners. Now, with the latest document revelations, Joe Biden unveiled his latest defense in the recent debate: \u201cI have not taken a single penny from any country whatsoever, ever.\u201d Team Biden points to Joe and Jill Biden\u2019s tax returns as evidence that Joe did nothing improper. It is worth noting that the family members upon whom foreign entities showered money are not required to disclose their finances. We now know the Biden paydays were anything but conspiracy theories. Hunter was getting roughly$1 million per yearfrom Burisma.Treasury Department alertsreveal that Russian oligarch Elena Baturina wired $3.5 million to Biden\u2019s interests. New text messages reveal that China Energy Company Ltd (CEFC)apparently paid$5 million to the Biden family.Another emailindicates Hunter demanded a $10 million-per-year \u201cfee\u201d from one of his Chinese business partners. There is no more doubt. The New York Postbroke newslast week that Joe Biden himself may have benefited from his son\u2019s dealings. The Post quoted a cryptic message from one of Hunter\u2019s partners, saying that \u201c10 [percent] held by H for the big guy?\u201d The recipient of that message, Tony Bobulinski,says\u201cthere is no question\u201d that \u201cH\u201d stands for Hunter and the \u201cbig guy\u201d is Joe Biden. We gain further insight into the operations of Biden Inc. in emails provided to us by Bevan Cooney, a former business associate of Hunter Biden. Cooney, who is currently in prison for his role in the Indian Bond Scheme that is sending Hunter Biden business partner Devon Archer also to jail, shared 26,000 emails that show what Hunter\u2019s role was in their business ventures. The Biden name was considered \u201ccurrency\u201d for their foreign business ventures, and was a \u201cdirect \u2026 pipeline\u201d to the Obama-Biden administration. Deals involving Hunter benefited from the \u201cBiden lift,\u201d the help that the name would provide in overseas dealings. What might the Bidens\u2019 foreign benefactors have expected in return for all this largesse? We can\u2019t say. But some may see a correlation between that foreign money and Joe Biden\u2019s policy posture toward the sources of that money. Consider the case of the Penn Biden Center, a DC think tank named after Joe Biden. According to the center, its mission is to \u201cAddress Threats to the Liberal International Order.\u201d The center analyzes the threats of \u201cRussia\u201d and \u201cclimate change\u201d in detail. But China \u2014 the largest violator of basic human rights on the planet \u2014 does not make the list. Why? Perhaps we now know why. The following information\u2014a roadmap to Biden corruption\u2014is based on a comprehensive analysis of multiple batches of Biden-related files and correspondences that Biden\u2019s associates, including Tony Bobulinski and Bevan Cooney, provided to my colleagues and me, exclusively. **The Bobulinski Files** Biden partner warned Bobulinski \u201cdon\u2019t mention Joe\u201d and the Bidens are \u201cparanoid\u201d about putting anything in writing Bobulinski says the Biden family is totally \u201ccompromised by China\u201d New emails from Bobulinski suggest Joe Biden (aka \u201cthe big guy\u201d) was given a 10% stake in a Chinese venture but Hunter Biden held the shares and cloaked Joe Biden\u2019s involvement Bobulinski\u2019s files are still being analyzed but thus far they provide the best evidence that Vice President Joe Biden was involved in the Biden family\u2019s foreign dealings and thereby compromised U.S. national security Bobulinski messages reveal Hunter was willing to help the Chinese with \u201ceverything\u201d\u2014indicates he is willing to facilitate Chinese takeovers of any and all U.S. industries except weapons and defense companies (and even this extremely low bar proved to be false as demonstrated the below-mentioned Henniges deal) In mid-October, a man named Tony Bobulinski contacted several investigative journalists claiming to be a close business partner of the Biden family. He provided enough text messages and emails to back up his assertions and authenticate his relationship with Biden Inc. Bobulinski wished to remain anonymous but was persuaded that, unless he came forward and went public, no one would believe that explosive details he could provide were authenticate. Simply put, Bidengate\u2014which continues to unfold day by day\u2014could not be and would not be based on anonymous sources. Bobulinski was connected to the Wall Street Journal who assured him that they would tell his story. But after a week of delays, slow-walking, and inaction, Bobulinski realized that the Wall Street Journal could not be trusted to release his story in a timely fashion. He thus authorized numerous journalists to comb through thousands of his Biden-related files\u2014corporate documents and correspondences, for the most part. This week Bobulinskiappeared onFOX News\u2019 Tucker Carlson Tonight to unpack his earth-shattering revelations. One of the largest bombshells that Bobulinski has released to date is the assertion that Joe Biden held apersonal10 percent stake in at least one of his son\u2019s Chinese ventures. Another message reveals Bobulinski was warned not to \u201cmention\u201d Joe in writing because the Bidens are \u201cparanoid.\u201d This text alone explains why Joe Biden\u2019s name does not appear in more correspondences and perhaps why Biden associates frequently used nicknames for one another. Here are the latest revelations based on my reporting on the Bobulinski files: New messages show Joe Biden son\u2019s expletive-laced rant that his lucrative Ukrainian pay was in jeopardy after father left office. Biden: \u201cI was fighting for the only income I have left.\u201d Co-authored by John Solomon atJust the News: \u201cAfter his father left office as vice president, Hunter Biden lamented to a business partner in spring 2017 that his lucrative and controversial relationship with the Ukrainian gas company Burisma Holdings was in danger of falling apart. \u201cI was fighting for the only income I have left right now from Burisma,\u201d Hunter Biden wrote in a series of terse, f-bomb-laden text messages in June 2017 to Tony Bobulinski, the chief executive officer of a China-related venture the Biden family was creating at the time. The messages were contained in dump of communications that Bobulinski, now a whistleblower to the Senate and FBI, made public in the last week. They were independently verified by Just the News with one of the recipients and provide fresh evidence that Hunter Biden\u2019s business fortunes appeared in many ways tied to his father\u2019s proximity to power. Since 2014, Hunter Biden\u2019s work as a board member for Burisma and its owner Mykola \u201cNikolais\u201d Zlochevsky has generated controversy, in part because the Ukrainian gas firm was under corruption investigation at the same time then-Vice President Biden oversaw U.S. anti-corruption policy in Ukraine. Records obtained by the FBI show that Rosemont Seneca Bohai \u2014 a U.S. firm tied to Hunter Biden and his longtime business partner and fellow Burisma board member Devon Archer \u2014 received regular monthly payments totaling $166,666 from Burisma starting in 2014 and continuing into 2016. A Senate report last month concluded Hunter Biden and his partner received at least $4 million in payments from the Ukraine gas company. Obama-Biden era State Department officials testified earlier this year that the Bidens created the appearance of a conflict of interest that undercut U.S. efforts to fight endemic corruption in the former Soviet republic of Ukraine. Hunter Biden acknowledged in an interview he did not have much experience in Ukraine or the gas industry and may have landed the job in part because of his famous name. The newly released Bobulinski text messages, along with documents obtained by Just the News under the Freedom of Information Act, add a new twist to the long-running saga. They indicate Hunter Biden\u2019s work with Burisma \u2014 and possibly part of his compensation \u2014 may have been tied to a gas deal in neighboring Kazakhstan that was struck in 2014 shortly after the vice president\u2019s son was added to Burisma\u2019s board. By spring 2017, Hunter Biden was worried that his Burisma income was in jeopardy and linked that income to his \u201cposition\u201d in the Kazakh deal, according to the text messages and separate interviews. The text message exchanges on June 4-5, 2017 came as an agitated Hunter Biden described to Bobulinski why he had not been more attentive to matters in a separate China deal the two were involved with. \u201cF[expletive] you Tony, I wasn\u2019t asleep and those guys work for the Ukrainians and they think I haven\u2019t left my room in 3 days,\u201d Hunter Biden texted. \u201cI was on Nikolais boat arguing about my position in their Kazakh deal and it was heated.\u201d \u201cI couldn\u2019t call because I was fighting for the only income I have left right now from Burisma. It was a very heated and very tense and extremely unavoidable meeting negotiation that had a lot more at stake than me meeting you to say I\u2019m not sending that letter to the Chairman under any circumstances,\u201d Hunter Biden added in the texts. Lawyers for Hunter Biden and Archer, and a spokesman for the Biden campaign did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Two days prior to the texts, on June 2, 2017, Zlochevsky attended the annual Burisma-sponsoredEnergy Security for the Futureevent in Monaco. Also inattendancewere the Atlantic Council\u2019s John Herbst, Burisma advisor Vadim Pozharskyi and Burisma board member and former president of Poland Alexander Kwasniewski, along with multiple current and former Ukrainian (and other foreign government) officials. Herbst, a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, had contacts in 2016 with the U.S. embassyin Kiev about efforts to end the corruption allegations against Burisma, documents previously obtained by Just the News show. The corruption cases in Ukraine were formally closed just days before Joe Biden left office, and U.S. officials feared two separate bribes had been paid by Burisma during the effort to get the cases shut down. Hunter Biden was not publicly listed as having attended the June 2017 event, but he hadattendedthe forum in the past. His text message to Bobulinski suggested he had been meeting with Zlochevsky on the sidelines. In December 2014, Burismaentered into an agreementwith Kazakhstan\u2019s national oil and gas company Kazmunaigaz. According to apress release, this made Burisma the \u201cfirst company in Ukraine, to develop oil & gas resources in the Republic of Kazakhstan together with the national oil & gas company.\u201d The deal wassignedin Astana, Kazakhstan, where a delegation of Burisma executives led by Zlochevsky met with Kazakh officials. Upon announcement of the deal, Zlochevskystated: \u201cIt is a recognition that today Burisma Holdings has unique both onshore and offshore equipment for exploration, drilling and seismic data, which has no analogues in the post-Soviet space. At the beginning of 2015, we are planning to invest in joint projects on the territory of the Republic of Kazakhstan.\u201d On the trip to Astana, Zlochevsky brought with him Archer, Hunter Biden\u2019s longtime business partner, and Vadim Pozharskyi. Archer is a longtime friend of the Biden family and joined the board of Burisma around the same time Hunter Biden did in spring 2014. Hunter Biden and Archer were involved in several business ventures together. Pozharsky is a longtime associate of Zlochevsky and was at the time an advisor to Burisma. Pozharskyi recentlymade headlineswhen an email surfaced publicly suggesting he had secured an off-the-books meeting in April 2015 with Vice President Biden arranged by Hunter Biden. The revelation appeared to conflict with Joe Biden\u2019s insistence that he \u201cnever discussed\u201d his son\u2019s business dealings. The Burisma delegation met with Kazakh Prime Minister Karim Massimov and Kazakh Foreign Minister Yerlan Idrisov. In June 2014, Kazakh dictator Nursultan Nazarbayev haddesignatedKarim Masimov to be his primary delegate to Ukraine, with the goal of forming friendly relations with the fledgling Poroshenko regime. Notably, Breitbart News recentlyrevealedan undated photo showing Joe Biden had dinner with his son Hunter and Massimov and a Kazakh businessman named Kenes Rakishev. Senate Homeland Security committee chairman Ron Johnson last monthidentifiedRahkishev as the foreign national behind a $142,300 payment that was sent to Archer in 2014 around the time of a key visit by Joe Biden to the region. Devon Archer received $142,300 from Kenges Rakishev of Kazakhstan, purportedly for a car, the same day Vice President Joe Biden appeared with Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseny Yasenyuk and addressed Ukrainian legislators in Kiev regarding Russia\u2019s actions in Crimea,\u201d Johnson\u2019s committee wrote in a report released last month. Less than a year after Archer\u2019s visit to Kazakhstan with Burisma, he was honored as a distinguished guest at a Sept. 27, 2015 \u201cCaptains of Industry\u201d banquet hosted by Kazakh leader Nazarbayev on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) meeting in New York. State Departmentmemosobtained via FOIA by Just the News reveal that members of then-Secretary of State John Kerry\u2019s team pulled strings to approve a last-minute request for Undersecretary Catherine Novelli to attend Nazarbayev\u2019s banquet with Archer. \u201cI know the time for UNGA meeting proposals is passed. An additional event has come up. Below, I have a preview draft below and confirmed guest list supplied by the Kazakhstanis,\u201d wrote the Kazakhstan desk officer to another State Department official on Sept. 3, 2015. One week later, the Kazakh desk officer followed up to see if approval had been granted. A separate email on Sept. 10, 2015showsthe expedited request was approved and Undersecretary Novelli would \u201crepresent the USG at a dinner hosted by Kazakhstan\u2019s President Nazarbayev.\u201d Hunter Biden ended his relationship with Burisma in 2019 as his father, Joe Biden, began his presidential campaign. Co-authored with Ivan atthe Epoch Times: \u201cHunter Bidenand an energy tycoon with extensive ties to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) had a cozy relationship, according to text messages disclosed to Senate investigators byTony Bobulinski, one of Biden\u2019s former business partners. In text messages sent to Bobulinski on Oct. 14, 2017, Biden wrote that he and Ye Jianming, the founder of multibillion-dollar Chinese energy conglomerate CEFC China Energy, had a \u201csolid\u201d relationship. Biden said he was the first guest at Ye\u2019s new apartment and that the billionaire cooked lunch for him. \u201cI\u2019ve been talking to the Chairman on a regular basis. I was his first guest in his new apartment/ he cooked me lunch himself and we ate in the kitchen together,\u201d Biden wrote, according totext message screenshotsobtained by The Epoch Times. Biden added that Ye \u201chas me helping him on a number of his personal issues\u201d including for \u201cstaff visas and some more sensitive things.\u201d The close relationship between the pair began as early as 2015, according to areportby the Republicans on the Senate Homeland Security Committee. The text messages raise significant questions considering the extensive ties between the communist regime and both Ye and his company. While on paper a private enterprise, CEFC had a rare contract to store part of China\u2019s strategic oil reserves, received financing from a regime-owned bank, and hired a number of former top officials from state-owned energy companies, according to Reuters. The company also had more layers of Communist Party committees than many private Chinese companies. The text message from Biden, the son of Democratic presidential nomineeJoe Biden, was in response to a question from Bobulinski, who had at that point spent months trying to figure out why Ye had not yet wired $10 million to SinoHawk LLC, the U.S. joint venture incorporated by Ye, Hunter Biden, James Biden, Bobulinski, and two more partners, James Gilliar and Rob Walker. SinoHawk LLC was created through a web of corporate entities, according to corporate records (pdf) obtained by The Epoch Times. Hudson West IV, a limited liability corporation controlled by Ye, owned half of SinoHawk. Hunter Biden and his partners owned the other half through Oneida Holdings LLC, which they in turn owned through five more corporate entities, one for each partner, the corporate documents (pdf) show. According to Bobulinski, the \u201cSino\u201d in SinoHawk stood for China, while \u201cHawk\u201d was picked because it was the favorite animal of Beau Biden, Joe Biden\u2019s deceased son. The emails, text messages, and documents reviewed for this article were produced by Bobulinski to the media and later to the Senate Homeland Security Committee. Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wisc.), the committee chairman, told The Epoch Times last week that the committee\u2019s ongoing review has found nothing to put the authenticity of the documents in doubt. \u201cWhat I can say about all of those sources, we\u2019re continuing to do our due diligence to verify and authenticate the genuineness of those emails,\u201d Johnsonsaid. \u201cAnd to date, we have found nothing that disputes them. All we\u2019ve found is verification, validation of their authenticity.\u201d At least one of the emails in the batch provided by Bobulinski matches word-for-word the emails purportedly obtained from a laptop belonging to Hunter Biden and published by The New York Post. Bobulinski reportedly turned in three of his smartphones to the FBI on Oct. 23. Ye\u2019s underlings in China and the United States kept on telling Bobulinski that the wire was coming while putting up baffling roadblocks, likeaskingBobulinski what the goals of the joint venture were despite signing off on corporate paperwork which listed the mission of the enterprise. Throughout the process, Bobulinski could not get in direct contact with Ye and had to deal instead with his lieutenants. \u201cSo u 1000% [didn\u2019t] reach out to Chairman Ye or Director Zang and create parallel noise?\u201d Bobulinski wrote to Hunter Biden on Oct. 14, 2017. \u201cI didn\u2019t [think] so but just trying to manage chaos.\u201d Biden responded by talking of his close relationship and regular talks with Ye, including that Ye engaged Biden as his attorney in the United States. Biden also curiously distanced himself from the acquisition deals in Oman and Luxemburg for which SinoHawk was ostensibly created. \u201cAnyway, he and I are solid so when and if you or James feel like I\u2019m capable of telling him about your Oman and Luxembourg or The Russian guys deal just let me know. We have a standing once a week call as I am also his personal counsel (we signed an attorney client engagement letter) in the US,\u201d Biden wrote. \u201cI assumed you lost interest as we haven\u2019t spoken for so long. Are any deals that you said were closing\u2014,\u201d Biden wrote. Bobulinski\u2019s responses suggest he was baffled by the response, considering the amount of effort he and other partners expended to get in touch with Ye to secure the promised $10 million in funding for SinoHawk. \u201cAbout \u2018my deals\u2019 they apparently are our deals not my deals,\u201d Bobulinski wrote. \u201cNot much for games, they were supposed to fund 10 MM USD, which they never did, and am assuming u know that.\u201d Ye never wired the money to SinoHawk, but Bobulinski would later learn from the Homeland Security Committee report that Hunter and James Biden received money from Ye via another channel. According to confidential documents obtained by the Senate Homeland Security Committee, on Aug. 4, 2017, more than two months before the Biden-Bobulinski text exchange, CEFC Infrastructure Investment (US) LLC, a subsidiary of Ye\u2019s company, sent Hunter Biden\u2019s law firm, Owasco, a payment for $100,000. Four days later, CEFC Infrastructure Investment wired $5 million to the bank account for Hudson West III, another entity controlled by Ye. On the same day the money arrived, Hudson West III started sending frequent payments to Hunter Biden\u2019s firm. \u201cThese payments, which were described as consulting fees, reached $4,790,375.25 in just over a year,\u201d the Senate report stated. A month later, on Sept. 8, 2017, Hunter Biden and Gongwen Dong, Ye\u2019s U.S. operative, applied for a credit line. Hunter Biden, James Biden, and James Biden\u2019s wife, Sara Biden, were authorized users for the credit cards linked to the accounts. They subsequently used the credit cards to buy more than $100,000 in luxury items including airline tickets and multiple items at Apple Inc. stores. When Bobulinski learned two years later about the money that flowed to the Bidens, he reached out to James Biden. \u201cHope you and family are well, safe and healthy. You can imagine my shock when reading the report yesterday put out by the Senate committee. The fact that you and HB were lying to Rob, James and I while accepting $5 MM from Cefc is infuriating,\u201d Bobulinski wrote, using Hunter Biden\u2019s initials. \u201cAnd so disappointing based on the years of work that James, Rob and team invested to get things done,\u201d Bobulinski added. Further hints about Ye and Biden\u2019s intentions for SinoHawk are revealed in anemailfrom one of Ye\u2019s lieutenants to Bobulinski. On July 26, 2017, Zhao Runlong wrote about the $5 million of working capital intended for SinoHawk as money \u201clent to BD family.\u201d \u201cThis $5 million loan to BD family is interest-free. But if the 5 M is used up, should CEFC keep lending more to the family?\u201d Zhao wrote, using \u201cBD\u201d as shorthand for \u201cBiden.\u201d A review of nearly 1,800 pages of emails and more than 600 messages Bobulinski handed over to Congress suggests that Bobulinski\u2019s insistence on running SinoHawk by the book may have resulted in Hunter Biden abandoning his partners and accepting money from Ye via another route. Bobulinski summed up the events prior to the last presidential debate on Oct. 22, telling reporters that Hunter Biden wanted to use SinoHawk as a personal \u201cpiggy bank\u201d before Bobulinski intervened. President Donald Trump invited Bobulinski as a guest to the debate because the emails and texts Bobulinski handed over to Senate investigators can be viewed as damaging to Joe Biden. Joe Biden\u2019s name does not come up in any of the corporate documents used to set up SinoHawk. At the time the company was formed, he was no longer in the White House. The texts and emails show that Gilliar brought Bobulinski into the deal to work full-time as the CEO of SinoHawk. Hunter Biden began to voice concerns about the direction of the company in mid-May, 2017, less than two weeks before the paperwork incorporating SinoHawk was signed. On May 13, 2017, Gilliar sent anemailto Biden, Bobulinski, and Walker about proposed \u201cremuneration packages\u201d and an equity breakdown between the five partners. Under the proposal, Hunter Biden would receive an $850,000 salary and a 20 percent stake in Oneida Holdings, which in turn owned half of the joint venture with Ye\u2019s company. The equity breakdown also included a 10 percent stake, which was to be held by Hunter Biden \u201cfor the big guy.\u201d Bobulinski told reporters on Oct. 22 that the \u201cbig guy\u201d was Joe Biden. Hunter Biden reacted to the proposal by pointing out that he would need more than $850,000 because after alimony and taxes he would be left with only $100,000 for himself. \u201cI have been the only one asked to give up all other active commercial interests- no consulting fees no promoting another business no continuing to work on existing projects etc\u2026so I have to admit I do expect that if I can\u2019t keep my toe in other things I will need a hell of a lot more than 850 p/y on a monthly basis,\u201d Bidenwrote. On the same day, Bobulinski wrote a text message to Gilliar: \u201cWe need to manage Hunter as every discussion makes me feel like he thinks things are going to be his personal piggybank.\u201d On May 16, 2017, Bobulinski responded to Hunter and partners by pointing out that the company would need an operating budget in order to make a profit. \u201cWe should all discuss so you are covered but you also have to be conscious of the moving parts and operating budgets and we have to pay a team of people who will be working 100 hours a week so we generate enough profits so we are distributing $10s of MM out to the owners,\u201d Bobulinskiwrote. \u201cI will be circulating the Terms for Oneida later today. In that I have included an [additional] payment to you and I as sitting on the board of SinoHawk. We can all discuss.\u201d In the following days, the money discussion escalated into a standoff about the ultimate control of the company. Bobulinski, who was taking on the CEO role, did not want to have his decisions overruled by the Bidens, who controlled half the company with the combined stakes. Hunter Biden pushed back hard, arguing that Ye went in for the deal solely due to the Biden family name. \u201cThey are both coming to be MY partner to be partners with the Bidens,\u201d Biden wrote in a group chat on May 17. The next day, in a text message sent directly to Bobulinski, Biden outlined his case for getting full control of the company. \u201cTony please stop the \u2018[you\u2019re] making me nervous\u2019 bull [expletive]. Come on man we both want the same thing. We want to make certain we have as much control over our own fates as possible. I don\u2019t blame you for wanting that \u2013 it doesn\u2019t \u2018make me nervous\u2019 it is what it is. Just happens that in this instance only one player holds the trump card and that\u2019s me,\u201d Bidenwrote. \u201cMay not be fair but it\u2019s the reality because I\u2019m the only one putting an entire family legacy on the line/ and if you think it\u2019s reasonable that I turn the keys over to someone that I\u2019ve spent less than 12 hours with than that makes me nervous. So I\u2019m asking you to do us all a favor and find a different way to alleviate your worries,\u201d Biden added. The argument then spilled out again into thegroup chat, with Biden making the case for why he should have more control of the company. At one point, Biden appeared to threaten to break Bobulinski\u2019s jaw, to which Bobulinski responded with an invitation to a fight. The argument exposed that Bobulinski didn\u2019t want to end up being a figurehead CEO to cover for the Biden family\u2019s involvement without any control over the company. \u201cAnd to add to it, if you are so worried about your family, you wouldn\u2019t be doing this because as u said, all of your dad\u2019s lawyers and any lawyer would advise you and Jim not to touch this with a 100 foot pole,\u201d Bobulinski wrote. \u201cSo if you are willing to take risk so be it, I am willing to stand by your side and take risk as well but there has to be balance in governance and the board.\u201d While Joe Biden\u2019s name does not appear in any of the corporate records disclosed by Bobulinski, the Biden family name was nonetheless one of the key offerings to Ye from Hunter Biden and his partners. An April 25, 2017, business proposal (pdf) prepared by the partners for CEFC, features a photo of Joe Biden with Columbian President Juan Manuel Santos. The proposal touts Joe Biden\u2019s relationship with Santos as a \u201cstrong one throughout the Obama administration.\u201d A section dedicated to potential CEFC investments in Oman noted that Hunter Biden\u2019s \u201cfamily & friends\u201d could be used to endorse Ye and CEFC and solicit a special exemption from the leader of Oman to establish a \u201cCEFC vehicle\u201d that is uniquely [sanctioned] by His Highness to omit the required local partner element.\u201d In a June 1, 2017,letterto Ye, Hunter Biden, after sending wishes from \u201cmy family and I,\u201d wrote \u201cI hope you are very happy with the progresses [sic] that has been made in Oman, this in my opinion cements our common belief, that by combining our connects and skills, we will create new opportunities in third geographies and economies, as well as the benefits for our two great countries.\u201d SinoHawk never got off the ground, but Hunter Biden and Gilliar appear to have been providing the same services for Ye in a less formal fashion since as early as February 2016. In anemailto CEFC sent on March 13, 2017, Gilliar referenced \u201cseveral strategy documents that [were] prepared earlier in our relationship\u201d including a proposal for the CEFC acquisition of Westinghouse Electric Corporation in the United States. The Westinghouse proposal (pdf) attached to that email was dated Feb. 22, 2016. CEFC China Energy was China\u2019s largest privately-held oil company before it was caught in Beijing\u2019s crosshairs in 2018. The oil conglomerate made billions of dollars in Russia, Europe, and parts of Africa, while Ye fostered ties with high-level Chinese Communist Party (CCP) officials. Ye has been missing since early 2018 after he was placed under investigation by the Chinese regime for \u201csuspected economic crimes\u201d and detained. A state-owned enterprise took control of CEFC in March 2019, and, according to Chinese media Caixin, the firm declared bankruptcy early this year. Hunter Biden, James Biden, Gilliar, Walker, Bobulinski, and the Joe Biden campaign did not respond to requests for comment. **The Cooney Files** In early October 2020, a man named Bevan Cooney contacted investigative journalist Matthew Tyrmand via his attorney and asked Tyrmand if he knew anyone who would be interested in accessing a private gmail inbox that contained a treasure trove of emails and attachments that would help elucidate the burgeoning Biden foreign influence scandal. Cooney provided written authorization for us to access and publish his emails. Tyrmand immediately thought of Peter Schweizer and the team (including me) that blew the Biden-China, Biden-Ukraine, and other Biden-corruption stories wide open in 2018, again in 2019, and again in 2020. Schweizer, Tyrmand, and I got Cooney\u2019s credentials and immediately set to work digging through Cooney\u2019s emails. It soon became clear that Cooney was definitively a Biden associate but somewhat of a fringe player and did not usually communicate directly with Biden family members (more often with Hunter\u2019s best friend and frequent business partner Devon Archer). Despite the fact that Cooney did not communicate with the Biden\u2019s often, his emails are still immensely valuable as Cooney, Archer and another Biden associate name Jason Galanis talked very openly about how they could \u201cleverage Hunter more\u201d and use his direct \u201cpipeline\u201d to the Obama-Biden administration as a form of \u201ccurrency.\u201d Bruner provides never-before-seen emails to Corey\u2019s Digs that reveal: Biden associates were aware that they should not invoke the Biden name. They often used code names and obscure references and inside jokes. Biden associates coordinated meetings for their business partners with Obama-Biden administration officials. Devon Archer talks candidly about securing new business with oligarchs and even the sovereign wealth fund of KazakhstanArcher: we could \u201cliterally be handed the keys to the sovereign wealth castle\u2026.I\u2019m going full Kazakh!\u201d One Biden associate used sexual innuendo to convey how excited he was at the prospect of landing a deal with the infamous billionaire Russian oligarch Elena Baturina In September 2015, the Obama-Biden administrationapproved the saleof a strategically sensitive Michigan manufacturer, Henniges Automotive, to a firm connected to Joe Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, and a Chinese military contractor that was on an American watch list because of its close ties to the People\u2019s Liberation Army. Hunter Biden\u2019s equity fund, backed by the Communist Chinese government, and the Chinese contractor, Aviation Industry Corporation (AVIC), needed special approval for the deal from the Committee of Foreign Investment in the U.S. (CFIUS) because Henniges produced technology with potential military use. AVIC entities have been sanctioned by the United States onfive separate occasionssince 1993 and the addition to thewatch list\u2013a major red flag\u2014occurred less than a year-and-a-half before they co-purchased Henniges with the Biden-led Chinese joint venture known as Bohai Harvest RST (BHR). The fact that CFIUS approved the deal is alarming given that Henniges ownsnumerous facilities in the United Statesthat are now controlled by a Chinese military front company. Internal BHR documents show exactly how the Chinese military contractor was able to disguise its ownership via shell corporations and formed a joint-venture with the son of the vice president to facilitate the Chinese takeover of an American dual-use technology supplier. Additional documents suggest that Hunter Biden\u2019s Chinese-backed venture funneled money to an entity controlled by Vanessa Kerry, the daughter of then-Secretary of State John Kerry, just one month before CFIUS approved the takeover. At the time, Secretary Kerry played a lead role on the Obama-Biden CFIUS committee. When news of the AVIC takeover of Michigan-based manufacturer Henniges Automotive hit the wire, Biden\u2019s associates celebrated, calling the transaction a \u201cproof of concept\u201d for future Chinese acquisitions. \u201cCongratulations!!!! Proof of concept again,\u201d read the subject line of Devon Archer\u2019s email on September 15, 2015. \u201cThis is great. Let\u2019s get a letter out to Ambassador Baucus ASAP Archie (an apparent Archer nickname),\u201d Bevan Cooney replied. Cooney is a former Biden associate who is now incarcerated for a separate venture\u2014the tribal bond scheme\u2014involving Biden\u2019s business partners. Cooney has provided investigative journalists Peter Schweizer and Matthew Tyrmand with access to his emails with written authorization. Cooney\u2019s emails (and their attachments) reveal how Hunter Biden\u2019s BHR viewed the Henniges acquisition\u2014which they code named \u201cProject Hanson\u201d\u2014as a major coup and a model for future BHR \u201ccross-border\u201d investments. Moments after the deal closed, Archer set to work drafting a letter to U.S. Ambassador to China Max Baucus (who happened to be alongtime friendof the Biden family). Archer\u2019s letter was an invitation to Ambassador Baucus to attend a banquet celebration for the deal with esteemed guest including BHR\u2019s communist state-owned \u201cstrategic partners\u201d and investors: I am writing to invite you to a cross-border banquet to celebrate our acquisition of Henniges Automotive. We consummated the transaction earlier this month, in conjunction with our strategic partner, AVIC, for $600 million. I have also attached a news article about the transaction.This milestone marks our first U.S.-based acquisition. Our strategic partners, including AVIC and Sinopec, will be in attendance, as will our investors, including the Bank of China and China Development Bank. We hope to discuss the opportunities and challenges of cross-border investments for Chinese companies in today\u2019s macro environment. A member of our team has also extended an invitation to your economics advisor \u2013 Jonathan Fritz \u2013 to speak at the seminar. The strategic partners and investors that Archer listed\u2014particularly Sinopec, the Bank of China, and the China Development Bank\u2014are all State-owned entities and therefore arms of the Chinese Communist Party whose executives/officials, along with BHR, clearly wanted to celebrate the Henniges coup. Indeed, Hunter Biden\u2019s Chinese business partners were pleased. Oneinternal BHR documentstates in both English and Mandarin Chinese: \u201cWe are incredibly proud of the perseverance, dedication and ingenuity of the Project Hanson team who collectively brought to life the first-born of BHR\u2019s cross-border investment platform, the first of many to come.\u201d Roger Robinson, a former senior director for international economic affairs on President Ronald Reagan\u2019s National Security Council,claimsthat \u201cthe U.S. government has known for years that AVIC has been helping China\u2019s military and aiding U.S. enemies and as such was sanctioned in the past.\u201d AVIC\u2019s well-known and long-established ties to the Chinese military-industrial complex makes the Obama-Biden administration\u2019s approval \u201call the more curious.\u201d \u201cThis is anything but a benign Chinese enterprise,\u201d said Robinson. But BHR and AVIC\u2019s Project Hanson helped obfuscate and ameliorate the AVIC connections by creating a complex ownership structure. One internal BHR document reveals precisely how the Chinese military front company was able to disguise its true ownership in a byzantine off-shore structure, presumably obfuscating the fact that the Chinese military was taking over U.S. company whose technology is on the restricted Commerce Control List (\u201cTarget\u201d refers to U.S. military supplier Henniges Automotive): Another internal BHR document contains a shocking revelation: Devon Archer facilitated Chinese \u201csupport\u201d for an entity called Seed Global Health. Seed Global Health wasco-foundedand controlled by the daughter of Secretary John Kerry. According to BHR\u2019s December 2015 internal document: \u201cA special shout out to our director and shareholder, Devon Archer, for his involvement with the Seed Global Health non-profit foundation, which works to send medical staff and resources globally to countries in need. BHR will continue to support this and other worthy causes.\u201d It appears that BHR is referring to afundraiser hosted by Devon Archerfor Secretary Kerry\u2019s daughter and her Seed Global Health organization that occurred on August 16, 2015\u2014less than one month before Kerry\u2019s State Department and the rest of the Obama-Biden CFIUS agencies approved Henniges takeover. The politically connected Seed Global Health has previouslycome under fire for receiving more than $9 millionin State Department funds without bids or competition and, in 2018, an executive at Seed Global Healthwas charged by federal prosecutorsfor violating federal conflict of interest laws and illegal lobbying. As Schweizer and I broke onBreitbart, Hunter Biden\u2019s business associates spoke candidly in emails about Hunter Biden\u2019s role in the business, particularly as it related to foreign ventures, apparently viewing the Biden name as a form of \u201ccurrency,\u201d and bragging that they had a \u201cdirect\u2026pipeline\u201d to the Obama-Biden Administration. In another email, Hunter Biden\u2019s associates touted Hunter\u2019s access to the White House and contrasted his willingness to \u201ctake on risk\u201d with that of Chris Heinz\u2014then-Secretary of State John Kerry\u2019s stepson and a close friend of Biden and Archer\u2014who was uncomfortable with some of their potential partnerships. In October 2013, Hunter Biden\u2019s associates (including Devon Archer)discussedwhich one of their corporate vehicles would be appropriate for a new deal they were working on. Archer noted their need to use a \u201cRosemont Seneca SPV\u201d (also known as a special purpose vehicle) because Rosemont Capital was too close to the Heinz family and because using an SPV could \u201cbring Hunter into the mix.\u201d Archer explained his desire \u201cto leverage Hunter more\u201d in a way that didn\u2019t involve Heinz, who Archer called \u201cmuch more risk averse.\u201d Another benefit of the Rosemont Seneca SPV was, per an October 5 email from Hunter Biden and Devon Archer\u2019s business associate Bevan Cooney to Archer, it \u201cwould be good to put some honey in Hunter\u2019s pocket.\u201d That same day Archer responded: \u201cAgreed. I also have more autonomy with that company as I own it with Hunter and he\u2019s willing to take on risk\u2026 Hunter will work if we need him too [sic] as well.\u201d Five days later, Biden\u2019s business associate Jason Galanis confirmed to Archer that he had changed the corporate references in the proposal to include a Hunter Biden-controlled firm. Archer replied, clearly pleased. \u201cPerfect. Let\u2019s just keep to that. We get the Biden lift and stay out of Heinz panties.\u201d Archer had noted he would use Rosemont Seneca Partners instead of Rosemont Capital, in which Heinz held a stake. Hunter Biden and Devon Archer\u2019s Rosemont Seneca Partners would play a pivotal role in their future deals. Forexample, in December 2013, Rosemont Seneca Partners finalized a deal with the Chinese government-backed investment vehicle, Bohai Harvest, to form Bohai Harvest RST, a new firm in which Hunter Biden wouldmaintain a 10% equity stakeand whose funds wouldgrow to at least $1.5 billion. Soon after that deal (and after Biden and Archer joined the board of Ukraine\u2019s Burisma Holdings), Heinz made moves to sever his formal business ties with Archer and Biden in May 2014. Just hours after Burisma\u2019s announcement that Biden and Archer had joined the board, Heinzemailed top aidesfor his step-father and then-Secretary of State John Kerry, alerting them to the potentially compromising arrangement. \u201cApparently Devon and Hunter both joined the board of Burisma and a press release went out today,\u201d Heinz said. \u201cI can\u2019t speak why they decided to, but there was no investment by our firm in their company.\u201d But Heinz\u2019s concerns apparently did not deter Biden and his associates from continuing to leverage the Biden family name to pursue questionable business arrangements. In an email on November 4, 2014, Biden\u2019s business associate Jason Galanis discussed a draft pitch that he was preparing for possible investors. Galanis explained that the presentation would cover boilerplate issues like investor protections. But Galanis also sought to emphasize their connections to the White House, specifically Vice President Joe Biden: \u201cI wanted to focus on the \u2018other currency\u2019 we are bringing to the table\u2026direct administration pipeline.\u201d Galanis also mentioned dropping Joe Biden\u2019s connections in their pitch when dealing with union pension funds. Galanis wrote, \u201cmaybe we should also remind of HB\u2019s dad\u2019s union relationships to justify the ask??\u201d In a March 2015, draft investor pitch, Biden\u2019s associates wrote about the need to \u201cleverage Hunter Biden Taft Hartley network.\u201d Taft Hartley is the law governing union pension funds, and Joe Biden has a long-established history of close relationships with union bosses, which Hunter Biden and Joe\u2019s brother James Biden havereportedly sought to capitalize onin the past. The presentation noted that the team \u201cled by Archer and Biden\u201d would create \u201cunprecedented opportunity for a firm at our scale,\u201d and referenced tapping finances from Chinese officials. In December 2013, as has been widely reported, Biden and Archer secured a $1 billion private equity deal financed by the Chinese government. Biden and his associates wanted to go back for even more Chinese money. In the March 2015, draft investor pitch, Biden\u2019s associates outlined the plan to leverage family clout for more foreign cash. In a section outlining where investments would come from, Biden\u2019s associates described capital flowing from \u201cChina>USA\u201d and \u201cFormer CCP [Chinese Communist Party]>USA.\u201d And the presentation also proposed more cross-border business deals involving \u201cChina SOE [State Owned Enterprises]\u201d and \u201cFormer CCP Energy.\u201d The above quotes are taken directly from a trove of 26,000 emails and attachments from Hunter Biden and Devon Archer\u2019s business associate Bevan Cooney. These emails\u2014provided to Schweizer from Cooney via journalist Matthew Tyrmand\u2014are completely separate from the emails released by the New York Post (purportedly derived from a backup of Hunter Biden\u2019s laptop hard drive). Cooney is currently serving time in federal prison for his role in the tribal bond scheme that also resulted in the conviction of Devon Archer on conspiracy and securities fraud charges. Archer currently awaits sentencing for that conviction. The Newly obtained emails from a Hunter Biden business partner lay out in detail how the Vice President\u2019s son and his colleagues used their access to the Obama-Biden administration to arrange private meetings for potential foreign clients and investors at the highest levels in the White House. These never-before-revealed emails outline how a delegation of Chinese investors and Communist Party officials managed to secure a private, off-the-books meeting with then-Vice President Joe Biden. In a 2011 email, Hunter Biden\u2019s business associates also discussed developing relations with what one called \u201cChina Inc.\u201d as part of a \u201cnew push on soft diplomacy for the Chinese.\u201d These emails are completely unconnected to the Hunter Biden emails being released by theNew York Post. These and more explosive never-before-revealed emails were provided to Schweizer by Bevan Cooney, a one-time Hunter Biden and Devon Archer business associate. Cooney is currently in prison serving a sentence for his involvement in a 2016 bond fraud investment scheme. In 2019, Cooney reached out to Schweizer after becoming familiar with the revelations in his 2018 book Secret Empires. Cooney explained that he believes he was the \u201cfall guy\u201d for the fraud scheme and that Archer and Hunter Biden had avoided responsibility. Archer, who was also convicted in the case, saw a federal judge vacate his conviction. But an appellate court overturned the lower court judge\u2019s ruling,reinstatingArcher\u2019s conviction in the case. Archer, Hunter Biden\u2019s longtime business partner, awaits sentencing. Cooney, their associate who is currently serving a prison sentence on his conviction in the matter, later reestablished contact with Schweizer through investigative journalist Matthew Tyrmand. From prison, Cooney provided Schweizer with written authorization, his email account name, and password to his Gmail account to retrieve these emails. He authorized, in writing, the publication of these emails\u2014 notable because it is the first time a close associate has publicly confirmed Hunter\u2019s trading on his father\u2019s influence. The emails offer a unique window into just how the Biden universe conducted business during the Obama-Biden Administration. These associates sought to trade on Hunter Biden\u2019s relationship with, and access to, his father and the Obama-Biden White House in order to generate business. For instance, on November 5, 2011, one of Archer\u2019s business contacts forwarded himan emailteasing an opportunity to gain \u201cpotentially outstanding new clients\u201d by helping to arrange White House meetings for a group of Chinese executives and government officials. The group was the China Entrepreneur Club (CEC) and the delegation included Chinese billionaires, Chinese Communist Party loyalists, and at least one \u201crespected diplomat\u201d from Beijing. Despite its benign name, CEC has been called \u201ca second foreign ministry\u201d for the People\u2019s Republic of China\u2014a communist government that closely controls most businesses in its country. CEC was established in 2006 by a group of businessmen and Chinese government diplomats. CEC\u2019s leadership boasts numerous senior members of the Chinese Communist Party, includingWang Zhongyu(\u201cvice chairman of the 10th CPPCC National Committee and deputy secretary of the Party group\u201d),Ma Weihua(director of multiple Chinese Communist Party offices), andJiang Xipei(member of the Chinese Communist Party and representative of the 16th National Congress), among others. \u201cI know it is political season and people are hesitant but a group like this does not come along every day,\u201d an intermediary named Mohamed A. Khashoggi wrote on behalf of the CEC to an associate of Hunter Biden and Devon Archer. \u201cA tour of the white house and a meeting with a member of the chief of staff\u2019s office and John Kerry would be great,\u201d Khashoggi said before including what should have been a major red flag: \u201cNot sure if one has to be registered to do this.\u201d Presumably, Khashoggi meant a registered lobbyist under the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA). Khashoggi believed the trip presented \u201ca soft diplomacy play that could be very effective\u201d and would give Hunter Biden\u2019s business partners \u201cgood access to [the Chinese] for any deal in the future.\u201d Indeed, the email boasted of CEC\u2019s wealthy membership:CEC\u2019s current membership includes 50 preeminent figures such as: Liu Chuanzhi, Chairman of the CEC, Legend Holdings and Lenovo Group; Wu Jinglian, Zhang Weiying, and Zhou Qiren, China\u2019s esteemed economists; Wu Jianmin, respected diplomat; Long Yongtu, representative of China\u2019s globalization; Wang Shi (Vanke); Ma Weihua (China Merchants Bank); Jack Ma (Alibaba Group); Guo Guangchang (Fosun Group); Wang Jianlin, (Wanda Group); Niu Gensheng (LAONIU Foundation); Li Shufu (Geely); Li Dongsheng (TCL Corporation); Feng Lun (Vantone) and etc. The gross income of the CEC members\u2019 companies allegedly \u201ctotaled more than RMB 1.5 trillion, together accounting for roughly 4% of China\u2019s GDP.\u201d The overture to Hunter Biden\u2019s associates described the Chinese CEC members variously as \u201cindustrial elites,\u201d \u201chighly influential,\u201d and among \u201cthe most important private sector individuals in China today.\u201d Before contacting Hunter Biden\u2019s associates, the CEC had been trying to get meetings with top Obama-Biden administration officials to no avail. \u201cFrom the DC side as you will see below they [CEC] have written letters to several members of the administration and others and have so far not had a strong reaction.\u201d \u201cThis is China Inc,\u201d wrote Khashoggi in the email, referring to the delegation of Chinese billionaires. \u201cBiggest priority for the CEC group is to see the White House, and have a senior US politician, or senior member of Obama\u2019s administration, give them a tour\u2026 If your friend in DC can help, we would be extremely grateful,\u201d Khashoggi emphasized. Hunter Biden and Devon Archer apparently delivered for the Chinese Communist Party-connected industrial elites within ten days . The original Oct. 19, 2011, email from Khashoggi was sent to Gary Fears \u2014 a controversial political fundraiser with a checkered history who was caught up in a riverboat casino scandal in the mid-1990s \u2014 who forwarded it on to Archer a couple weeks later on Nov. 5, 2011. Time was short, as Khashoggi\u2019s original email noted that the Chinese delegation would be in DC on Nov. 14, 2011. Fears told Archer to \u201creach out\u201d to Khashoggi about the request regarding getting the Chinese businesspersons and officials into the Obama White House, adding it would be \u201cperfect for\u201d Archer to also \u201cattend\u201d with them and then \u201cget guys for the potash deal.\u201d The same day Fears sent Khashoggi\u2019s message to him, Archer took the email from Fears and sent to Khashoggi a business proposal for a potash mine deal he had lined up. Six days after the initial overture, Archer received a followup email asking how a meeting with CEC\u2019s representative went. The email closed with \u201cDo me a favor and ask Hunter [Biden] to call me \u2014 I\u2019ve tried reaching him a couple of times.\u201d Archer responded, \u201cHunter is traveling in the UAE for the week with royalty so probably next week before he will be back in pocket\u2026. The meeting with [CEC representative] was good. Seems like there is a lot to do together down the line. Probably not a fit for the current Potash private placement but he\u2019s a good strategic relationship as the mine develops. Definitely have a drink with Mohammed and let him know how impressed I was with his whole deal.\u201d One minute later, Archer sent a follow-up email, \u201cCouldn\u2019t confirm this with Hunter on the line but we got him his meeting at the WH Monday for the Chinese folks.\u201d On the day of the meeting, November 14, 2011, Cooney emailed Fears to confirm that Archer \u201cgot the Chinese guys all taken care of in DC.\u201d The Obama-Biden Administration archives reveal that this Chinese delegation did indeed visit the White House on November 14, 2011, and enjoyed high-level access. The delegation included approximately thirty members, according to White Housevisitor logs. But those records also obscure perhaps the most important item for the Chinese delegation: a meeting with Vice President Joe Biden himself. The visitor logs list Jeff Zients, the deputy director of Obama\u2019s Office of Management and Budget (OMB), as the host of the CEC delegation. Obama hadtaskedZients with restructuring and ultimately consolidating the various export-import agencies under the Commerce Department\u2014an effort in which the Chinese delegation would have a keen interest. Atrip itineraryposted by the CEC also confirms the delegation met with Obama\u2019s then-recently-confirmed Commerce Secretary John Bryson. Curiously, the Obama-Biden visitor logs do not mention any meeting with Vice President Joe Biden. But the Vice President\u2019s off-the-books meeting was revealed by one of the core founders of the CEC. Inan obscure documentlisting the CEC members\u2019 biographies, CEC Secretary General Maggie Cheng alleges that she facilitated the CEC delegation meetings in Washington in 2011 and boasts of the Washington establishment figures that CEC met with. The first name she dropped was that of Vice President Joe Biden. The relationships established during that visit may have benefited Hunter Biden and Devon Archer down the road. Two years later, they famously helped to form the Chinese government funded Bohai Harvest RST (BHR) investment fund.

The main characters that enriched the Bidens are reportedly from Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and China.

Executive Summary of Senate Report on Biden Family Corruption: In early 2015 former Deputy Chief of Mission at the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv, Ukraine,George Kent raised concerns to officials in Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s office about the perception of a conflict of interest with respect to Hunter Biden\u2019s role on Burisma\u2019s board.Kent\u2019s concerns went unaddressed and in September 2016, he emphasized in an email to his colleagues, \u201cFurthermore, thepresence of Hunter Biden on the Burisma board was very awkward for all U.S. officials pushing an anticorruption agenda in Ukraine.\u201d In October 2015, senior State Department official Amos Hochstein raised concerns with Vice President Biden, as well as with Hunter Biden, thatHunter Biden\u2019s position on Burisma\u2019s board enabled Russian disinformation efforts and risked undermining U.S. policy in Ukraine. Hunter Biden was serving on Burisma\u2019s board (supposedly consulting on corporate governance and transparency) when Burisma ownerMykola Zlochevsky allegedly paid a $7 million bribe to officials serving under Ukraine\u2019s prosecutor general, Vitaly Yarema, to \u201cshut the case against Zlochevsky.\u201d George Kent testified that this bribe occurred in December 2014 (seven months after Hunter Biden joined Burisma\u2019s board), and, after learning about it, he and the resident legal adviser reported this allegation to the FBI. In addition to the over four million dollars paid by Burisma to Hunter Biden and his business partner, Devon Archer, for membership on the board,Hunter, his family, and Archer received millions of dollars from foreign nationals with questionable backgrounds. Devon Archer received $142,300 from Kenges Rakishev of Kazakhstan, purportedly for a car, the same day Vice President Joe Biden appeared with Ukrainian Prime Minister Arsemy Yasenyukand addressed Ukrainian legislators in Kyiv regarding Russia\u2019s actions in Crimea. Hunter Biden received a $3.5 million wire transfer from Elena Baturina. Ms. Baturina is Russia\u2019s richest female oligarch and the wife (widow) of the former mayor of Moscow. Hunter Biden had business associations with Ye Jianming, Gongwen Dong, and other Chinese nationals linked to the Communist government and People\u2019s Liberation Army. Those associations resulted in millions of dollars in questionable transactions. Hunter Biden opened a bank account with Gongwen Dong that financed a $100,000 global spending spree with James Biden and Sara Biden. Hunter Biden also moved millions of dollars from his law firm to James Biden\u2019s and Sara Biden\u2019s firm. Upon being questioned about the transaction, Sara Biden refused to provide supporting documentationand information to more clearly explain the activity. The bank subsequently closed the account. Hunter Biden paid nonresident women who were nationals of Russia or other Eastern European countries and who appear to be linked to an \u201cEastern European prostitution or human trafficking ring.\u201d Indeed, Obama-Biden-era State Department officials (including Marie Yovanovitch and George\u2014the star witnesses during Trump\u2019s impeachment hoax) were well aware that Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s proximity to the corrupt Ukrainian gas Burisma (via Biden\u2019s son) created a terrible perception of a conflict of interest. Yovanovitch even acknowledged that Biden\u2019s name was mentioned in connection to an alleged \u201cbribe\u201d scheme. In addition to cataloguing the numerous examples of Biden\u2019s conflicts of interest and the threats that those conflicts posed to U.S. national security, Senator Johnson\u2019s and Senator Grassley\u2019s Homeland Security report exposed a gallery of rogues\u2014a cast of shady foreign characters\u2014ingratiating themselves to the Obama-Biden White House through financial deals made with the Biden family. To read the full article on JustTheNews.com,Click Here. Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs and the Senate Committee on Finance released their highly anticipated report on Hunter Biden\u2019s extensive dealings with China, Russia, and Ukraine while his father Joe Biden served as vice president. The joint report reveals that Hunter Biden received taxpayer-funded accommodations including transportation aboard Air Force Two and Secret Service security details while he traveled to make business deals with Chinese, Russian, and Ukrainian entities. According to the report, Hunter Biden received Secret Service protection on trips to multiple foreign locations, including Moscow, Beijing, Shanghai, Taipei, Hong Kong, and dozens of other cities. The joint committee investigation into the Bidens\u2019 potential conflicts of interest \u201cbegan in August 2019, with Finance Committee Chairman Grassley\u2019s letter to the Department of the Treasury regarding potential conflicts of interest with respect to Obama administration policy relating to the Henniges transaction,\u201d a controversial deal linked to the Bidens. The Senate report provides a detailed roadmap, exposing the Bidens\u2019 connections to hostile foreign governments and individuals, including convicted criminals. Quoted material below is from the joint committee report (except the quotes appearing within the report itself). The main characters reportedly enriching the Bidens are from Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and China: Vice President Joe Bidenadmiring People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) withChinese Communist leader Xu Jinping. Meanwhile, Hunter Biden bagged millions while he helped the Chinese takeover American companies with sensitive military applications Ye Jianmingis a Chinese national with close ties to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and the Chinese military, also known as the People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA). He is the founder of China Energy Fund Committee and CEFC China Energy Co. Ltd. Ye allegedly wired massive sums of money through CEFC and related entities resulting in \u201cmillions of dollars in cash flow\u201d benefitting the Biden family. Multiple transactions between Ye Jianming\u2019s enterprise and Hunter Biden were flagged by the U.S. Treasury Department for \u201cpotential criminal financial activity,\u201d and in February 2018 Ye Jianming was reportedly under investigation in China for \u201csuspected economic crimes.\u201d According to the report: \u201cYe Jianming is a Chinese businessman and a frequent figure in Hunter Biden\u2019s financial dealings in China. Based on public reports that were available in 2015, when his contact with Biden began to ramp up, Ye was a founder of CEFC China Energy Co. Ltd (CEFC) and served as chairman of the board for its subsidiary, the China Energy Fund Committee (CE Fund). CEFC had a reported income estimated at $33.4 billion, according to 2013 figures that were available at the time. Although CEFC reportedly remained a private company until state-owned enterprises assumed control of it in 2018, reporting in 2017 indicated that it received financing from the China Development Bank, \u2018hired a number of former top officials from state-owned energy companies\u2019 and had \u2018layers of Communist Party committees across its subsidiaries \u2014 more than at many private Chinese companies.\u2026\u2019 In addition to the Communist government, Ye also had reported connections and affiliations to the People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA). For example, from 2003 to 2005, Ye reportedly served as deputy secretary general of the China Association for International Friendly Contacts (CAIFC), which is the public name for the PLA General Political Department\u2019s International Liaison Department. Additionally, in 2014, under Ye\u2019s leadership, CE Fund had co-organized events with the China Huayi Broadcasting Corporation (CHBC), a company incorporated by the PLA General Political Department. The CEO of CHBC, Wang Shu, was commander of the PLA General Political Department base \u2018at the forefront of applied psychological operations and propaganda directed against Taiwan,\u2019 which was managed by a training center that was funded by a subsidiary of CEFC\u2026.Wang reportedly attended the 2014 CE Fund and CHBC event along with Xu Jialu, a man who was associated with the PLA\u2019s CAIFC as well as CE Fund and China\u2019s Confucius Institutes. Huasheng served as executive director of CE Fund\u2019s China Institute of Culture Limited (CIOC), \u2018a nationally supported organization in charge of \u201cpromoting Chinese culture.\u201d\u2018 Accordingly, Ye and his associates had robust relationships with China\u2019s military units, some of which were involved in matters in direct opposition to U.S. policy in the region.\u201d GongWen Dongis a Chinese national with deep ties to the Chinese communist regime and the Chinese military. GongWen Dong \u201cwas Ye Jianming\u2019s associate and reportedly executed transactions for his companies.\u201d As Ye Jianming\u2019s associate, GongWen Dong helped funnel millions of dollars to Hunter Biden and even facilitated a six-figure \u201cglobal spending spree\u201d for Hunter Biden and Joe Biden\u2019s brother James Biden and James\u2019 wife Sara Biden. According to the report: \u201cOn 09/08/2017, Hunter Biden and GongWen Dong applied online to Cathay Bank and opened a line of credit under the business name Hudson West III, LLC. The cards were collateralized by transferring $99,000.00 from a Cathay Bank account to the Hudson West III business account where the funds were held until the cards were closed. The authorized users of these credit cards include Hunter Biden, James Biden and Sara Biden and each used the cards around the world to purchase $101,291 worth of extravagant items to include airline tickets, multiple purchases at Apple Stores and pharmacies, as well as hotels and restaurants.\u201d Patrick Hois a Chinese national and close associate of Ye Jianming. He was also a reported client of Hunter Biden, personally, and was co-represented by Hunter Biden\u2019s former law firm Boies Schiller Flexner. Ho was convicted by the U.S. Justice Department for money laundering, conspiracy, and violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (which deals with international bribery schemes). Patrick Ho was convicted in 2019 on money laundering, conspiracy, and FCPA charges after the U.S. Department of Justice charged him in November 2017. Hunter Biden was paid massive sums to counsel Ho even as Joe Biden was preparing to run for President. According to the report: \u201cIn November 2017, Ye Jianming\u2019s associate and Hunter Biden\u2019s reported client, Patrick Ho, was arrested and charged with violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, international money laundering, and conspiracy to commit both. The first call that he reportedly made was to James Biden, who reportedly referred him to Hunter Biden. Ho was convicted in March 2019 on charges of money laundering, conspiracy, and violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and was sentenced to three years in U.S. prison for his role in a multimillion-dollar scheme to bribe officials in Chad and Uganda in exchange for business advantages for CEFC, Ye\u2019s company. Department of Justice documents describe Ye as Patrick Ho\u2019s boss and, again, note that Ye\u2019s company supplied funding to the China Energy Fund Committee. Ho worked as the secretary-general of the committee during the period when he was carrying out his illegal schemes.\u201d Elena Baturinais a billionaire Russian oligarch and the widow of the former mayor of Moscow. Baturina, who is reportedly close to Putin, has received hundreds of millions of dollars in illicit money through corruption schemes, according to the report. In February 2014, the Russian oligarch wired $3.5 million to a Delaware-based entity co-founded by Hunter Biden called Rosemont Seneca Thornton LLC. According to the report: \u201cHunter Biden and his associate, [Devon] Archer, had a financial relationship with Russian businesswoman Elena Baturina. Baturina is the former wife of the late Yuri Luzhkov, who was the mayor of Moscow and was fired in 2010 by then-Russian president Dmitry Medvedev over corruption allegations. Baturina became Russia\u2019s only female billionaire when her plastics company, Inteko, received a series of Moscow municipal contracts while her husband was mayor. According to reporting, \u2018Luzhkov used his position as mayor to approve over 20 real estate projects that were built by a Baturina-owned construction company and ultimately generated multibillion-ruble profits for his family.\u2019 In addition, a Russian investigation led to a criminal case against the former head of the Bank of Moscow, Andrey Borodin, who \u2018allegedly used money from the Moscow City Budget to lend money to shell companies, which ultimately transferred $443 million to Baturina.\u2019\u201d Kenges Rakishevis a businessman and the son-in-law of a prominent Kazakh politician who has close ties to longtime Kazakh dictator, President Nursultan Nazarbayev. Rakishev is the sole shareholder of a company called Novatus Holding, which wired $143,300 to Rosemont Seneca Bohai (an entity controlled by Hunter Biden and Devon Archer). At the time of the transfer, Rakishev\u2019s father-in-law was the mayor of Kazakhstan\u2019s capital city, Astana. Kenges Rakishevis the son-in-law of a prominent Kazakh politician with close ties to longtime Kazakh dictator Nazarbayev According to the report: \u201cAt the time of Vice President Biden\u2019s visit to Kyiv, there were divided opinions in Kazakhstan over Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea and the international situation had produced tension in the region generally. Nazarbayev\u2019s government reportedly shifted positions over time, and Nazarbayev reportedly made some statements supportive of Russia\u2019s actions. Given Rakishev\u2019s close connection to political leadership in Kazakhstan, the tense political situation, Hunter Biden\u2019s longstanding relationship with Archer and involvement in transactions with Rosemont Seneca Bohai, and the fact that the payment was timed perfectly with Vice President Biden\u2019s visit to Kyiv to discuss U.S. sanctions against Russia for the invasion of Crimea, the April 22, 2014 payment from Rakishev to Rosemont Seneca Bohai raises serious questions. It is unclear why a foreign company, Novatus Holding, would purchase a $142,300 car for Rosemont Seneca Bohai when the company does not deal in vehicles.\u201d Vice President Bidenmaking deals withUkrainian President PoroshenkowhileHunter Bidentook in millions from a corrupt Ukrainian gas company. Mykola Zlochevskyis the Ukrainian oligarch who founded Burisma. Zlochevsky has been accused of criminal activity amounting to massive corruption in multiple countries including Ukraine and the United Kingdom. Zlochevsky allegedly sought favor with the United States via the vice president by funneling money to Biden family associates \u2014 primarily Hunter Biden and Devon Archer. According to the report: \u201cHunter Biden was serving on Burisma\u2019s board (supposedly consulting on corporate governance and transparency) when Zlochevsky allegedly paid a $7 million bribe to officials serving under Ukraine\u2019s prosecutor general, Vitaly Yarema, to \u2018shut the case against Zlochevsky.\u2019 [U.S. diplomat George] Kent testified that this bribe occurred in December 2014 (seven months after Hunter joined Burisma\u2019s board), and, after learning about it, he and the Resident Legal Advisor reported this allegation to the FBI.\u201d Devon ArcherHunter Biden\u2019s Russian, Ukrainian, and Chinese business partners were not the only ones with criminal allegations against them. Hunter Biden\u2019s close friend and business partner Devon Archer was indicted for a massive fraud scheme (though Archer himself beat the charges). Devon Archer was implicated in a massive Native American tribal bond scheme (the native Americans were allegedly scammed by Archer and his associates\u201d According to the report: \u201cIn May 2016, Hunter Biden\u2019s business partner, Archer, and five others were arrested and criminally charged in a scheme to defraud investors and a tribal entity of millions of dollars. Starting Jan. 25, 2016, Burisma began sending regular payments for Biden to his Washington law firm, Owasco PC (Owasco). Owasco was incorporated on Jan. 19, 2006, lists an agent address in Washington, and lists its executing officer and governor as Robert Hunter Biden. Payments from Burisma to Owasco continued throughout most of 2016 and ceased eight days after Donald Trump defeated Hillary Clinton in the Nov. 8, 2016 presidential election. Between Jan. 25, 2016, and Nov. 16, 2016, Burisma sent nine wires totaling $752,054.99 to Owasco with each of the nine transactions listing \u2018Owasco, PC/Robert Biden\u2019 as the recipient. Of the nine, two payments were for $83,333.33, five were for $83,333 one was for $84,992.33, and one was for $83,731.291 The records acquired by the Committees show the last documented payment was made on Nov. 16, 2016. Biden continued to serve on Burisma\u2019s board of directors until April 2019.\u201d The joint-committee report states that the Senate committees experienced delays, including due to instances of \u201cobstructive behavior,\u201d and that the transactions detailed within the report \u201craise criminal concerns.\u201d The Biden campaign issued a statement before the report was released accusing Senator Johnson of pushing \u201ca long-disproven hardcore right-wing conspiracy theory\u201d and trying \u201cto subsidize a foreign attack against the sovereignty of our elections with taxpayer dollars,\u201d referring to the foreign sources that Johnson and Grassley\u2019s report cited. However, the Biden campaign has not has not yet addressed the numerous allegations contained in the report that are based on non-partisan financial records called Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) issued by the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). Regarding his work in China and Ukraine, Hunter Biden has previously admitted to \u201cpoor judgement\u201d but denied any \u201cethical lapse.\u201d After the Senate report was released, Hunter Biden\u2019s daughter, Naomi Biden, posted a series of tweets defending her father: \u201cHere\u2019s a thread on my dad, Hunter Biden \u2014 free of charge to the taxpayers and free of the corrosive influence of power-at-all-costs politics. The truth of a man filled with love, integrity, and human struggles.\u201d Spokespersons for Devon Archer and James Biden have not yet responded to requests for comment.
