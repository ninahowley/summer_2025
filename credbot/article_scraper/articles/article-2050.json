This is acontinuationof Jabaroot\u2019s hacking claims. Recent social media reports suggest that the group published a leaked dossier from Morocco\u2019s road safety agency, NARSA. It remains to be seen whether the claim is authentic or another allegation that will be eventually denied by the agency in the coming hours. In the past few months, the group made similar announcements, claiming responsibility over cyberattacks targeting several other Moroccan databases, including the National Social Security Fund (CNSS) and the National Agency for Land Registry (ANCFCC). Sources from the land registry agency denied that its system was directly targeted, clarifying that the breach involved a notaries\u2019 platform, Tawtik, which is managed independently. An authorized source from ANFCC said recently that no intrusion or data leak has been detected in its information system. Converging reports suggested that the Algerian hacking group may have access to data on the notaries\u2019 platform by \u201cexploiting vulnerabilities in inadequately protected computers.\u201d **Leave a ReplyCancel reply** Your email address will not be published.Required fields are marked* Comment* Name* Email* Website Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.
