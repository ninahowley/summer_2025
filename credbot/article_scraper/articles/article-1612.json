These students are hard at work. \u201cWe do tests, but they don't get graded,\u201d 3rd grader Sean Johnson said. Indeed, it\u2019s math camp\u2014of course, there are no real grades. But there is real learning happening here. \"We've been learning about the power of twos, fractions, multiplication, and long division,\" 5th grader Carine Mugwaneza said. This camp offers students the opportunity to challenge themselves in the STEM field. \u201cI am learning a lot of new math I didn\u2019t learn in second grade,\u201d said Johnson. That\u2019s what this is all about\u2014to show these students they can do these types of things. Frederick Jenkins, a fifth-grade math teacher and camp instructor, emphasized the importance of the program. \u201cIt's an opportunity for them to push past the norm. A lot of lower-income families don\u2019t have access to robotics programs, engineering programs, or advanced math programs that encourage our students to strive for more,\u201d Jenkins said. Priya Jones, a rising sophomore at Brebeuf Jesuit Preparatory School and a camp volunteer, is happy to help instill confidence in the campers. \u201cIt\u2019s really important to get communities such as these into math and just getting them situated within this subject,\u201d she said. Exponentia Prime's whole mission is to bridge the gap for Black and Brown students so they can have equal opportunities in education. \u201cIt's really amazing to see them grow\u2014from maybe even crying about one problem to feeling super confident and saying, \u2018I got it,\u2019\u201d Jones said. The hope is that offering rigorous math instruction will give these students an upper hand when they face standardized tests. \u201cIf we don't put that in front of them early, they won't have the opportunity to learn and grow in college,\u201d Jenkins reiterated. Exponentia recognizes the systemic barriers and biases that prevent too many Black and Brown students from pursuing advanced coursework and careers in STEM fields. The initiative aims to show kids like these that it\u2019s possible. \u201cI kinda want to be a teacher,\u201d shared Carine Mugwaneza, a fourth grader, while Sean Johnson added, \u201cI want to be an astronaut.\u201d At the camp, the engaging and educational activities are not just fun but meaningful, reinforcing essential skills. \u201cBecause it\u2019s fun and you learn new stuff,\u201d Sean summed up. In addition to rigorous math instruction, the camp also enriches students' understanding of their history. Educators are teaching young scholars about notable historical minority figures who made significant contributions to STEM fields, like Willa Brown and the Tuskegee Airmen. This connection helps students see the potential for their own futures and the legacy of excellence they can carry forward. **Sign up for theBreaking News Newsletterand receive up to date information.** **now signed up to receive theBreaking News Newsletter.** **Click here for Pacers coverage!** **Click here for Pacers coverage!** Indianapolis Local News Weather Indianapolis Interactive Traffic Map Sports Entertainment Life Marketplace Don't Waste Your Money Support Sitemap Do Not Sell My Info Privacy Policy Privacy Center Journalism Ethics Guidelines Terms of Use EEO Careers FCC Public Files FCC Application Public File Contact Accessibility Statement Scripps Media Trust Center Closed Captioning Contact WRTV6 wrtvnews wrtv UCfLYcp8eh4VAC8_BBRsHhFg"}
