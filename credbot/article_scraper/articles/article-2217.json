But that's not all \u2014we\u2019ll also be ignoring any court result, public activism, environmentalists, and, in general... everyone.\u201d The council reassures that a comprehensive review process has been undertaken to ensure nobody has been listened to, no opinions have been considered and no voices have been heard. \u201cWe will keep engaging with all residents to create more dialogue opportunities where no listening will be involved\u201d , said the lead councillor. \u201cThis has only been possible thanks to all the public feedback initiatives that have been hosted with a deep sense of indifference\u201d \u201cWe really need to hear what community groups and local businesses have to say so we can be more precise when it comes to completely ignore them and implement our already made decisions\u201d \u201cEven if some people may want to be heard, most of the people certainly want to be ignored, we can\u2019t please everyone, can we\u201d , said the councillor. The governing body has also communicated the new plans for public consultations, where all community input will be recorded on scented paper and cute stationery, then used as wallpaper in the Town Hall, to ensure everyone feels a deep sense of belonging. image frompixabay author: Alba Late www.newsbiscuit.com Tags: London Opinion Council Planning Permission Survey News in Brief Local News Lifestyle **Recent Posts** **Back to Top** **Subscribe for updates** Thanks for submitting!
