Wallace (LBW) Community College. \u201cI\u2019ve looked at our education system in the U.S. and then focused on Butler County and Greenville and I wanted to see what I could do to help,\u201d said Kenneth Crum, chairman of Concern Citizens. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take the effort of parents, students, educators, community leaders and city officials to help make a better system.\u201d Crum said the conference is designed to bring together local voices and statewide experts to discuss both challenges and actionable solutions in education. **Email newsletter signup** \u201cI figured I had the reach to bring in the experts to not only shed light on what\u2019s going on but offer solutions to help improve it,\u201d Crum said. Panelists include Dr. Kenyetta Kendrick, founder of Kreative Teacher, LLC; Aziya Flynn, Alabama FBLA State President; Dr. Antwauan Stinson, education coordinator; Carolyn Crenshaw, former Butler County Board of Education member; Dr. Jacqueline A. Brooks, assessment and field placement coordinator at Tuskegee University; LaCretia Williams, sociology professor at Alabama State University; Jennifer Burt, retired educator; Patrick Muhammad, known as The Principal Farmer; Harry Crum, CTE counselor; Marcus Hall of Monroe STEM and representatives from the Family Sunshine Center. The event will be moderated by WSFA news anchor Rosanna Smith. Dr. Kendrick emphasized the urgent need to refocus on education. \u201cUnfortunately, education has become a second thought,\u201d Kendrick said. \u201cIt has taken a back seat. Education is an institution that is alive. As our society changes, so should we. \u201cWe\u2019re going to discuss what we can do within our communities to bring about changes in our education system and what resources are available for both short term and long term actions.\u201d Crum hopes the inclusion of a student panelist will spark deeper understanding and engagement. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be a very well-rounded conference,\u201d Crum said. \u201cWe can hear from the experts exactly what we can do to make the most impact. Then we\u2019ll have a Q&A session and I\u2019m hoping for a lot of engagement. We even have a student on the panel because we want to hear from the youth about what they see and what their issues are.\u201d The event is open to the public and organizers encourage educators, parents, students and community members to attend and participate. **Greenville considers grant to fund demolition** **Camellia City Civitan Club celebrates 70 years** **City of Greenville\u2019s Garbage Notice** **Going from pair to spare** Special Section **Special Section** **Special Section** Calendar of events **Calendar of events** **Calendar of events** Home News Sports Opinion Lifestyles Obituaries Small Business About Us Contact Us Subscriptions \u2013 old Policies Submit a Photo Submit a News Tip Engagement Announcement Wedding Announcement \u00a9 2025, The Greenville Advocate"}
