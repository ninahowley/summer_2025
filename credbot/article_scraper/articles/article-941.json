Eduardo Roberto Medina-Berumen, 22, is charged with two counts of murder and other charges stemming from the May 31 shooting that killed 35-year-old Officer Samuel Riveros \u2014 a nine-year department veteran \u2014 along with the shooting minutes earlier of 43-year-old Darius Wong, a married father of two young daughters. Medina-Berumen, who was injured in the gun battle, appeared in court in a wheelchair and agreed to a deputy public defender\u2019s request that his arraignment be postponed. The murder charges include the special circumstance allegations of multiple murders and murder of a peace officer that could open him up to a possible death sentence if convicted as charged. District Attorney Nathan Hochman said last week that his office will decide later whether to seek capital punishment. Medina-Berumen is also charged with one count of possession of an assault rifle and two counts of attempted murder involving two other Baldwin Park police officers, including Officer Anthony Pimentel, whom Hochman said was wounded when he was \u201chit by shards of glass that came from a bullet that we believe hit a windshield or a side windshield.\u201d Riveros was a part of a response dispatched at about 7:15 p.m. May 31 to the 4200 block of Filhurst Avenue, a few blocks east of the San Gabriel River (605) Freeway, regarding a man with a rifle, the sheriff\u2019s department reported. Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna said the Baldwin Park Police Department received a report of a man armed with a rifle who was shooting, saying that Pimentel and fellow Officer Alfredo Leal \u2014 who are identified as the victims in the attempted murder charges \u2014 arrived at the scene first in separate cars and were \u201cimmediately fired upon by this suspect who had a rifle.\u201d \u201cAn officer-involved shooting occurred at that time and Officer Pimentel was injured as a result of the suspect\u2019s gunfire,\u201d Luna said, adding that Riveros arrived soon after and he was \u201ctragically struck by the suspect\u2019s gunfire and unfortunately that ended up being a fatal gunshot.\u201d Other Baldwin Park police officers who subsequently arrived at the scene were involved in a \u201csecond volley\u201d of gunfire in which \u201cthe suspect went down,\u201d according to the sheriff.

That\u2019s an act of profound courage,\u201d Luna said, calling what happened \u201ca tragedy\u201d and saying that it serves as a painful reminder of the dangers law enforcement officers face on a daily basis. A man with a gunshot wound to his upper body \u2014 later identified as Wong \u2014 was located at the scene and rushed to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead. The motive for that shooting remains under investigation. During Wednesday\u2019s brief court hearing in Pomona, Deputy District Attorney Michael Michelena told Superior Court Judge Ramiro P. Cisneros that he believes prosecutors can prove the defendant was standing outside his home with a short-barrel rifle and \u201cstarted firing indiscriminately.\u201d Michelena said Wong was shot first prior to the officers\u2019 arrival. Officers ultimately \u201ctook him into custody after he ran out of ammunition,\u201d the prosecutor said. At a June 3 news conference announcing the charges, Hochman said a .223-caliber assault pistol was found at the shooting scene with a 30-round magazine and approximately 40 to 60 expended shell casings that were found near the weapon. Baldwin Park Police Chief Robert Lopez \u2014 who was among those who was in court for Medina-Berumen\u2019s first court appearance \u2014 last week called Riveros a \u201cdedicated officer\u201d who \u201cselflessly put the safety of others before his own (and) gave his life doing so.\u201d \u201c\u2026 We will never forget Sam,\u201d he said. Riveros was described as a UC Irvine graduate, an avid snowboarder and a Dodgers fan who had watched the team play at stadiums across the nation. The Peace Officers Research Association of California established an online fundraiser to support Riveros\u2019 family and cover funeral expenses. Donations can be made atporac.org/fundraiser/officer-riveros/. In a GoFundMe page established to help cover funeral expenses for Wong, his brother Victor Vuong said his sibling died \u201cin the most innocent of ways \u2014 without truly knowing what was happening.\u201d \u201cHe was a kind soul with so much more life ahead of him,\u201d Vuong wrote. \u201cAs we try to come to terms with this tragic loss, I\u2019m asking for support to help cover funeral expenses and to give Darius the peaceful farewell he deserves. More importantly, we are also seeking justice for Darius. No one should have to experience what he went through, and we won\u2019t stop until the truth is known and accountability is found.\u201d More than $54,000 had been raised by the GoFundMe page as of Wednesday afternoon. **Leave a comment** Your email address will not be published.Required fields are marked* Comment* Name* Email* Website Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment. \u0394 **Get the Latest News by Email!** Sign up here for our free newsletters.
