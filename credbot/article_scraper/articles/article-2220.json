Ms. Willamette agreed to speak to us about why she decided it was time to file official paperwork with the state, declaring herself a Tesla dealership. \u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, as a woman, living in America I know my rights aren\u2019t as important as a man\u2019s. Living in Texas, that reality is infinitely more clear,\u201d Ms. Willamette told us as we began our conversation. \u201cBut when our country\u2019s attorney general, a woman by the way, said that she agreed with the president, and that violence against Tesla dealerships will be considered domestic terrorism, I thought maybe I should give it a go. I\u2019ve been to a handful of Planned Parenthoods and seen violent, angry protesters there, so it dawned on me that I was only ever going to be protected if I was a rich, white man, or one of his car dealerships.\u201d Willamette is a fourth grade teacher. Each month, she and her students do a lockdown drill to prepare for potential active shooters on campus. She said she finds it \u201codd\u201d that school shootings aren\u2019t considered domestic terrorism but spray painting a swastika on a Cybertruck would be. \u201cAgain, don\u2019t take this as surprise or shock. I\u2019m a woman in my thirties living in a country where at least 30% of the population thinks they should tell me when, why, and how to fuck. You get used to being bossed around by Jesus Nazis, I guess. I\u2019m just saying that to me, if you\u2019re gonna pretend to be pro-life, and that you want to protect your citizens from terrorism, why wouldn\u2019t you treat every single school shooter as a domestic terror event?\u201d Building up that backup account with the hits.#windmillcancer#trump#politicalsatire#fyp#politik#politics#backupaccount#liberal \u266c original sound \u2013 James Schlarmann Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton issued a statement condemning Ms. Willamette, and asking the FBI to arrest her on charges of \u201cbeing an uppity, smart-mouthed broad.\u201d \u201cHere in Texas, we don\u2019t take kindly to having our beliefs mocked and our authoritarian kookery called out at all, much less in such an intellectually astute manner,\u201d Paxton declared in his statement. \u201cMs. Willamette should probably self-deport, or at the bare minimum self-report herself to one of our state\u2019s beautiful new camps for concentrating populations of lesser-valued humans to work off her debt to society. I encourage and welcome the Glorious Trump Reich to arrest her now and teach her a lesson for being an uppity, smart-mouthed broad.\u201d \u201cYou know, I just thought it might be cool if my government defendedmy rightsfor a change, that\u2019s all,\u201d Jeanette said as she ended our Zoom call.
