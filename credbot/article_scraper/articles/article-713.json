Afterwards, the Daughters enjoyed a luncheon consisting of Salad, Kentucky Hot Brown, and Dessert. During the luncheon, the gavel was passed on to the new Regent, Margie Maloney, by the outgoing Regent, Kelley Cole. The gavel was originally presented to the Trabue Chapter in 1908. It was made from wood rescued from the historic Old North Church in Boston, Massachusetts. Following the luncheon, a tour of the historic Tavern was offered to new members. Duncan Tavern was built in 1788 by Joseph Duncan, who served in the Revolutionary War as a civilian armorer, and was inducted into the Virginia Militia as a Captain. Later on, he attained the rank of Major. By 1803, the tavern was called theGoddess of Liberty.Through several transitions, the structure fell onto hard times and by the early 20th century was condemned by the City of Paris in 1940. The large dilapidated home, the largest stone structure in Paris, was slated for demolition when it was offered for sale to Julia Spencer Ardery and her DAR Chapter, Jemima Johnson, for the price of $1.00. The sale came with a caveat by which they had to agree to renovate the structure and have it ready for use in one year. Mrs. Ardery assumed the enormous task and led the renovation. The renovated building contains a museum and a library and became the Kentucky Society of the Daughters of the American Revolution (KSDAR) official headquarters in 1941, when the building\u2019s ownership was formally accepted by the Kentucky Society DAR Executive Board. Any woman 18 years and older who can prove lineal, bloodline descent from an ancestor who aided in achieving American Independence is eligible to join the DAR. She must provide documentation for each statement of birth, marriage and death, as well as of the Revolutionary War service of her Patriot ancestor.
