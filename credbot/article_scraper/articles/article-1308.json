(Philip Davali/Ritzau Scanpix via AP) COPENHAGEN, Denmark \u2014 Denmark\u2019s Parliament on Wednesday approved a bill to allow U.S. military bases on Danish soil, a move that comes as President Donald Trump seeks to take control of the kingdom\u2019s semi-autonomous territory of Greenland. Critics say the vote ceded Danish sovereignty to the U.S. The legislation widens a previous military agreement, made in 2023 with the Biden administration, where U.S. troops had broad access to Danish airbases in the Scandinavian country. The new parameters follow Trump\u2019s coveting of the strategic, mineral-rich Arctic island even as the U.S. and Denmark are NATO allies. Danish Foreign Minister Lars L\u00f8kke Rasmussen, in a response to lawmakers\u2019 questions, wrote that Denmark would be able to terminate the agreement if the U.S. tries to annex all or part of Greenland. Ninety-four lawmakers voted for the bill, with 11 against. The legislation now goes to Danish King Frederik X for his signature. Greenland\u2019s prime minister previously said U.S. statements about the island have been disrespectful and it \u201cwill never, ever be a piece of property that can be bought by just anyone.\u201d **previous coverage** Space Force commander in Greenland fired following Pentagon rebuke Greenland picks party favoring slow independence in surprise Denmark is open to US expansion in Greenland, prime minister says Rubio says Trump Greenland bid \u2018not a joke,\u2019 citing China risks Denmark orders ships for Greenland after Trump demands **Subscribe to Stars and Stripes** **stars and stripes videos** **around the web** **stripes top news** **U.S.** **U.S.** **U.S.** **Editors' Picks** VA\u2019s disability calculator produced wrong results, costing some vets thousands of dollars Museums preserving history of 82nd Airborne, 2nd Cavalry among 29 on Army shutdown list K-Town Now features the latest news from the Kaiserslautern Military Community **Video Spotlight** **follow us** **Explore** COVID Archive photo of the day Pacific Storm Tracker Opinion Today's ePaper Contingency Edition Weekly Comics Special Publications **Events** **Sign Up for Daily Headlines** Sign up to receive a daily email of today's top military news stories from Stars and Stripes and top news outlets from around the world.
