The false claims also could undermineoveralltrust in government institutions and in the electoral process itself. NewsGuard has found that bad actors are increasingly employing AI tools, including deepfake technology, to generate convincing false narratives with fabricated testimonies and manipulated videos. (Read moreabout NewsGuard\u2019s recent report on a Russian disinformation networkthat exemplifies how AI has become a force-multiplier.)
