The threats stemmed from the alleged non-delivery of marijuana-containing packages. On Friday, Simon Peters, 42, was sentenced to eight months in prison and 30 months of supervised release. He had pleaded guilty on February 18 to one count of making threats against public officials. The U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of the Virgin IslandssaidPeters called the Ottley Post Office in St. Thomas, USVI, on January 27, 2024, and issued multiple death threats toward a postal carrier. Among the threats, Peters reportedly said: \u201cMake sure the fat boy know, we\u2019re watching him and next time we\u2019re going to kill him behind the building\u201d and \u201cAny more packages from California go missing, you will see what happen to the co-workers dem \u2026 one by one.\u201d Two days later, Peters called again and continued making threats. When asked why he wanted to speak to the delivery driver, Peters said, \u201cTo let the people know what\u2019s going on in the Virgin Islands. We got people driving around looking for him, and you gon hear him get gun shots in his [expletive] ass.\u201d He also claimed to have been \u201cdoing this for over 10 years now.\u201d As a result of the threats, USPS temporarily suspended mail delivery to Kirwan Terrace for two days and brought in agents from other jurisdictions to escort carriers. A private security firm was also hired to provide additional protection at local post offices. The U.S. Postal Inspection Service tracked the calls to California, where Peters was located and arrested before being transferred to the Virgin Islands for prosecution. The investigation was led by USPIS with assistance from the FBI, DEA, HSI, U.S. Marshals Service, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and the Virgin Islands Police Department.
