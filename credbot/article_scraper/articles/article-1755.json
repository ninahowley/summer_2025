Tips on Controlling Your Dreams **How to Have a Lucid Dream Tonight! Tips on Controlling Your Dreams** Last updated onDecember 30, 2022 Imagine it\u2014a world where you are in control of your own dream. A world where you can do the impossible, and even fly above the trees. That is the power of lucid dreaming. Lucid dreaming is when you become aware that you are dreaming while you are still asleep. It is an amazing experience that can offer insights into your own subconscious and allow for some serious creativity. So, how do you get started? Read on for an introduction to lucid dreaming and tips on how to have one tonight! **What is lucid dreaming?** Lucid dreaming is, as mentioned above, becoming conscious of the fact that you are dreaming while still asleep. There are multiple benefits to lucid dreaming, including increased creativity, decreased nightmares, and insight into one\u2019s subconscious mind, as well as having fun with the limitless possibilities of dreams. **How to prepare yourself to have a lucid dream tonight** The most important step in learning how to lucid dream is getting familiar with what dreams look like to you. Before nighttime, reflect on any memorable dreams and start a dream diary. Are there any common themes or dream signs? Ideally, you will eventually want to keep a dream diary by your bedside and write down any dreams you remember when you wake up from them each morning. Make sure to make note of any dream signs or elements that are peculiar or abnormal in the dream. Once this has been done for several weeks or months, it will make it much easier to recognize patterns within your dreams and know when something feels off\u2014which may indicate that it\u2019s time for a lucid dream. **Tips for having a lucid dream** Although lucid dreams may come to you spontaneously, there are a variety of techniques available thatstudiessuggest actually work. **Reality testing** Throughout the day, get in the habit of asking yourself whether you\u2019re dreaming. By practicing reality testing while you\u2019re awake, it will become second nature to perform these tests in your dreams tonight. By recognizing that the test results are altered when you switch to a dream world, this can act as proof of lucidity and let you take control of your dreams. Some examples include touching your palm or looking at your reflection in the mirror. **The MILD technique** The MILD strategy (Mnemonic Induction of Lucid Dreaming) is a technique where you make the intention to remember that you\u2019re dreaming. Here\u2019s how: When going to bed tonight, refer back to your dream journal and think of your most recent dream and any dream signs. As you fall asleep, set your intention by telling yourself \u201cTonight when I dream, I will remember that I\u2019m dreaming\u201d Believe it and make sure not to doubt yourself once the intention has been set. If you wake in the middle of your sleep, focus on your dream and imagine yourself going back in, while telling yourself, \u201cWhen I dream, I will remember that I\u2019m dreaming.\u201d The MILD technique is most effective if you wake up during your sleep, since the dream is so fresh in your head.Studiessuggest that interrupting sleep for a duration of 30 minutes is more beneficial than shorter intervals. **The WBTB method** In the Wake Back To Bed (WBTB) technique you intentionally wake yourself with an alarm, stay awake for about 30 minutes, and then go back to sleep. While you\u2019re awake, do some activity that absorbs your mental energy, like reading, and then go back to sleep. The WBTB is a good one to combine with the MILD technique above. Do this by reflecting on your most recent dream and setting that intention to remember that you are dreaming once you fall asleep. **Lastly, keep calm** The key here is not getting too excited about having a lucid dream just yet; stay calm and focused throughout your sleep cycle so that when the moment comes, you don\u2019t wake up too soon. **Control Your Dreams Tonight** Try using these tips tonight and start exploring the depths of your subconscious world with ease. Who knows\u2014maybe this will be the night where all those wild dreams come true. If it doesn\u2019t happen tonight, keep at it. By familiarizing yourself with sleeping patterns and cycles, practicing regular dream recall, and setting clear intentions before going to bed each night\u2014you\u2019ll be well on your way towards achieving lucidity in no time at all!
