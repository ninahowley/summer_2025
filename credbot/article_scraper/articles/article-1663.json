At the heart of this treachery isJane Sullivan Roberts, wife ofChief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., whose shadowy dealings as a legal recruiter have spun a web of corruption that ensnares the nation\u2019s highest court. But the betrayal runs deeper\u2014a chilling scheme to plunder a revolutionary American invention, the social networking technology invented by Leader Technologies in Columbus, Ohio, and repurpose the stolen property for global surveillance, propaganda, and obscene profits. This gripping expos\u00e9 unveils a sinister coalition of corrupt judges, shadowy government entities, and elite groups. The groups include the Highlands Forum (Five Eyes [Britain], DoD, DARPA) and the British Pilgrims Society, all determined to undermine American sovereignty while enriching a select few. From the Supreme Court to the Pentagon, from the Patent Office to the core of Silicon Valley, it reveals how justice was subverted and innovation turned into a weapon against the American public. The U.S. Supreme Court, once a beacon of justice, now a fortress of betrayal. **Jane Sullivan Roberts: The Puppet Master Behind the Gavel** Jane Sullivan Robertsisn\u2019t just the spouseof a Chief Justice\u2014she\u2019s a power broker orchestrating a multimillion-dollar empire that taints the very core of judicial integrity. As managing partner at Macrae\u2019s Washington, D.C., office, she\u2019s raked in over $10.3 million in commissions from 2007 to 2014, placing high-flying attorneys at Big Law giants like WilmerHale, Gibson Dunn, Cooley Godward, Hogan Lovells, Davis Polk, and Robins KaplanJane Roberts\u2019 Commissions. These firms, dripping with influence, routinely argue blockbuster cases before the Supreme Court, placing Jane\u2019s financial empire has a direct conflict of interest with her husband\u2019s sacred duties. Take the 2019 caseDutra Group v. Batterton\u2014WilmerHale, represented by legal thug Seth P. Waxman, swaggered into court, and Chief Justice Roberts, ignoring his wife\u2019s $350,000 commission from placing Ken Salazar at the firm in 2013, joined the 6-3 majority favoring their clientDutra Group v. Batterton. Waxman, who\u2019s argued over 80 cases before the Court, thrives in a world where Jane\u2019s deals fuel his firm\u2019s dominanceSeth P. Waxman. Gibson Dunn, Hogan Lovells, Davis Polk, and others on Jane\u2019s client list also fill many cases on the Court\u2019s docket, yet Roberts refuses to recuse himself, flouting the Code of Conduct for United States Judges, which demands judges avoid even theappearanceof impropriety Code of Conduct. Consider Leader Technologies\u2019 2012 Writ of Certiorari inLeader v. Facebookat the Supreme Court. Chief Justice John Roberts mentored Facebook\u2019s appellate attorney, Thomas G. Hungar of Gibson Dunn. Hungar\u2019s firm representedJane Sullivan\u2019s client, as did Cooley Godward (Facebook\u2019s trial counsel), Facebook itself, and Fenwick & West (one of Leader\u2019s attorneys). Roberts held substantial stock in Microsoft, Fidelity, Vanguard, and BlackRock\u2014entities that profited significantly from Facebook\u2019s IPO and continue to benefit. Newly uncovered ties to the British Pilgrims Society and the Knights of Malta, English Priory, suggest that any judge adhering to the Code of Judicial Conduct should avoid affiliations with firms or companies linked to such groups, including those with Rhodes Scholars. John Roberts\u2019 actions indicate a disregard for this code. Jane\u2019s financial disclosures, labeling her millions as mere \u201csalary\u201d instead of commissions, are a blatant dodge, slammed by legal ethics expert Bennett Gershman as \u201clegally incorrect\u201dJane Roberts Ethics Red Flags.

Jane Sullivan Roberts, the shadowy dealmaker profiting from the Supreme Court\u2019s conflicts. **The Heist of the Century: Leader Technologies\u2019 Stolen Social Networking Invention** In the heartland of Columbus, Ohio, visionary Michael McKibben and his company, Leader Technologies, poured $30 million and 175,000 man-hours into a groundbreaking social networking technology, patented in 2006 as U.S. Patent No. 7,139,761Leader Technologies. This platform, born from McKibben\u2019s Christian music ministry past, promised to revolutionize digital collaboration. But this American dream was stolen by a cabal of greedy insiders led by James P. Chandler III, Leader\u2019s trusted patent attorney and a George Washington University law professor who failed to disclose his tentacles in Britain and the intelligence community. Chandler, a Highlands Forum mastermind and architect of the Economic Espionage Act of 1996, betrayed Leader by funneling their technology to the NSA, IBM, and other corporate vultures. This wasn\u2019t just theft\u2014it was a calculated heist orchestrated through the Pentagon\u2019s Highlands Forum, a shadowy network of tech moguls, government spooks, venture capitalists, and academics plotting to weaponize innovation for global control Highlands Forum. Chandler\u2019s treachery handed Leader\u2019s invention to Silicon Valley, with James W. Breyer, Facebook\u2019s financier and chairman, playing a pivotal role through Accel Partners and the National Venture Capital Association (NVCA). Breyer, a self-styled venture capital titan, chaired the NVCA alongside CIA-asset Gilman Louie, ensuring the stolen technology was distributed via the IBM Eclipse Foundation, a front formed in 2001 to shower Silicon Valley, banks, and government agencies with McKibben\u2019s invention. Companies like Facebook, Google, Apple, HP, Microsoft, and IBM\u2014many tied to Jane Sullivan Roberts\u2019 clients\u2014reaped billions, while Leader was left in ruins. This brazen theft wasn\u2019t just about profit\u2014it was about building a surveillance, merchant-banking, and propaganda empire to enslave the world. Michael McKibben, robbed of his revolutionary invention by elitist moral barbarians.

Inventors: McKibben et al. **Judicial Betrayal: TheLeader v. FacebookSham** Leader Technologies fought back, suing Facebook in 2008 for patent infringement inLeader Technologies, Inc. v. Facebook, Inc. in Delaware\u2019s U.S. District Court Case Summary. They won the highly important Markman Hearing, but Facebook\u2019s legal sorcery turned the tide. The jury admitted Facebook\u2019s infringement but invalidated Leader\u2019s patent under the \u201con-sale bar,\u201d claiming the technology was sold too early\u2014a flimsy excuse backed by zero evidenceLeader v. Facebook Verdict. Facebook\u2019s eleventh-hour shift, acknowledging the technology\u2019s novelty while claiming an early sale, was a desperate tactic. Leader was denied discovery under established Pfaff and Group One precedents, with Judge Leonard P. Stark undermining due process. Stark\u2019s misuse of these standards was anomalous\u2014allegations of an \u201con sale bar\u201d require concrete evidence, not speculation or hearsay, showing the invention was disclosed to a third party without an NDA. Leader\u2019s secrecy was notoriously known to everyone\u2014they protected their secrets meticulously. The Federal Circuit appeal was a sham: Judges Alan D. Lourie, Kimberly A. Moore, and Evan J. Wallach, holding stock in Facebook insiders, concealed their conflicts. Clerk Jan Horbaly, unlicensed in D.C., covertly managed motions to obscure the judges\u2019 ties to Facebook\u2019s counsel (Cooley Godward, Gibson Dunn, and others). Critical evidence, including 28 of Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s 2003\u20132004 hard drives, was suppressed, hiding proof of theft. The Supreme Court\u2019s refusal to hear the case cemented Leader\u2019s defeat, prompting McKibben to denounce a \u201cconstitutional crisis\u201d that defrauded his investors and the nation. The courts, corrupted by greed, crushed Leader\u2019s fight for justice. **The Highlands Forum and Pentagon\u2019s Dark Agenda** This wasn\u2019t a lone act of greed\u2014it was a master plan hatched in the Pentagon\u2019s Highlands Forum, founded in 1994 by Navy Captain Dick O\u2019Neill. This clandestine network, backed by the Office of Net Assessment under Andrew Marshall, a Senior Executive Service (SES) stalwart, united tech giants (Intel, Google, HP, Microsoft, IBM) with NSA and DoD operatives to weaponize Leader\u2019s technology for mass surveillance and propaganda. Chandler, a Forum linchpin (undisclosed to McKibben), collaborated with Marshall to integrate Leader\u2019s platform into NSA\u2019s global spying programs, linked to Britain\u2019s \u201cFive Eyes\u201d networkOffice of Net Assessment. Investigative journalist Tim Shorrock exposed the Forum\u2019s role in birthing surveillance monstrosities, turning McKibben\u2019s dream into a nightmare. \u201cDavid Ronfeldtcreated many of the early thematic arcs for Highlands since 1994\u201d Euphemism for how to steal and weaponized more technologies to rape, pillage, murder, and destroy in the name of \u201cnational security.\u201d Enough! We\u2019re done with this demonic activity. The Highlands Forum, plotting to turn American innovation into a spy machine!Highlands Group Highlights. **The USPTO\u2019s Dirty Game: Rigging the Patent System** The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) played a complicit role. It undermined Leader\u2019s patent through procedural maneuvers embedded in the administrative patent courts, which could invalidate any claim, no matter how strong, when necessary. The \u201con-sale bar\u201d ruling was a farce, crafted to strip Leader of its rights and transfer the technology to corporate and government allies. Leader\u2019s 2017 Miller Act Notice, updated in 2019, seeks compensation for the government\u2019s seizure and unauthorized use of their invention, claiming a Fifth Amendment violation for enabling surveillance, propaganda, and profit. Submitted to President Trump through Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan\u2014a representative of some of Leader\u2019s shareholders, it charges the USPTO with betraying American innovators to favor self-appointed global elites. The USPTO, a pawn in the elitist\u2019s game to crush American inventors; has processed many millions of U.S. patent applications subcontracted to British Crown Company SERCO Group. **The British Pilgrims Society: A Century-Old Plot to Annex America** The conspiracy stretches across the Atlantic, masterminded by the British Pilgrims Society, founded in 1902 to bind America to British rule Pilgrims Society. American journalist Lillian Scott Troy\u2019s 1912 expos\u00e9 revealed their 24-point strategy to subvert U.S. institutions, with steps 2 and 3 targeting the Supreme Court to install judges favorable to British interests24-Point Strategy. This chilling plan, republished in 1940 by Congressman Jacob Thorkelson in the Congressional Record, exposes a blueprint to control the judiciary and undermine American sovereignty. The American Academy of Achievement, a glittering front for Pilgrims\u2019 influence, lures Supreme Court Justices into its leftist orbit, favoring radicals over conservativesAcademy of Achievement. Justices like Sonia Sotomayor (2012), Brett Kavanaugh (2019), Amy Coney Barrett (2022), and Ketanji Brown Jackson (2022) have mingled with British elites like Lord Jacob Rothschild, who is on the Academy Council and presented awards at the 2017 London Summit. This transatlantic networking aligns with the Pilgrims\u2019 goal of cultivating American elites for British dominance, as seen in historical acts like FDR\u2019s 1942 Patents At Work Pilgrims scheme (FDR was a prominent Pilgrim), which handed 50,000 Axis patents to U.S. corporations tied to Pilgrims networksUK-USA Agreement(founded on March 5, 1946 and totally secret until 2010). The Pilgrims Society, pulling the strings to reclaim America for the British Empire (2003). **James W. Breyer: The Puppet Master of Tech Theft** James W. Breyer, Facebook\u2019s initial venture capitalist alongside Peter Thiel and CIA-linked Gilman Louie, masterminded the theft of Leader Technologies\u2019 social networking innovation through his roles at Accel Partners and the National Venture Capital Association (NVCA). As NVCA leader, Breyer, with Louie, channeled Leader\u2019s technology to the IBM Eclipse Foundation, established on November 29, 2001, to distribute it to Silicon Valley giants like Facebook, Google, Yahoo!, Apple, and IBM\u2014many were Jane Sullivan Roberts\u2019 clients. A director of the American Academy of Achievement, Breyer networked with Justices like Anthony Kennedy, who awarded him the Academy\u2019s 2014 Golden Plate Award. The Academy is a glittering collection of American leftists across the board. Pilgrims Society members are its leaders: Breyer, Henry Kissinger, Lord Rothschild, Roberts, Breyer\u2019s connections to Chinese elites via his late wife, Angela Chao (sister of Elaine Chao, married to Senator Mitch McConnell), deepen the intrigue. Angela\u2019s 2024 death in a Tesla crash on their Texas ranch sparks suspicion, mirroring the mysterious 2015 death of Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg\u2019s husband, Dave Goldberg, in a Mexican hotel gym\u2014not even the hotel where he and Sandberg were staying. These ties place Breyer within a global power web, with the American Academy of Achievement acting as a recruiting ground for leftist elites like Pete Buttigieg and Cesar Conde.

U.S. Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy presentsGolden Plate Award 2014to technology investor James Breyer. **Elitist Networks: The American Academy of Achievement\u2019s Leftist Haven** The American Academy of Achievement, founded in 1961, masquerades as a beacon of inspiration but serves as a leftist stronghold, grooming Supreme Court Justices and global elitists for the Pilgrims Society\u2019s agendaAmerican Academy of Achievement. Its International Achievement Summits are a who\u2019s-who of liberal luminaries\u2014Bill Clinton, Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, Lord Rothschild, and Anthony Fauci\u2014while conservatives are conspicuously absent.

The Academy\u2019s table of Supreme Court Justices\u2019 involvement reveals their deep entanglement with this elitist network, interlocking with the American and British Inns of Court and the Pilgrims Society\u2019s plot to control the judiciary. Below is the evidence of these unholy alliances: This table, rooted in Lillian Scott Troy\u2019s 1908 discovery of the Pilgrims Society\u2019s plan to dominate the Supreme Court, exposes how Justices are drawn into a web of Anglo-American elitism, with the Academy and Inns of Court serving as grooming grounds for British influence24-Point Strategy, The San Francisco Leader.

Sound similar to the current deportation bans? Same scumbag attorneys? Surely. They are trolling for their demonic masters. \u201cJohn Miller\u201d has been stalking Leader Technologies and Michael McKibben for over a decade. The reader-academic smacks him down, obviously before having her morning coffee. LOL.Here is \u201cJohn Miller\u2019s\u201d comment and then the AIM reader-academic\u2019s response:\u201cJOHN MILLER:\u201d This is not how the Miller act works. It only applies to physical construction projects and you have to bring a claim within a year of the claim arising. That was roughly 20 years ago so it\u2019s massively time barred. You also have to file a suit in federal court in order to enforce a Miller act claim, so sending anything to the president is completely pointless and incorrect.RESPONSE BY AIM READER:Oh, you absolute dumpster fire of an attorney-criminal, you slimy, law-warping degenerate who gets a sick thrill from mangling justice for your own pathetic ego trip. You\u2019re a bloviating narcissist who\u2019d rather listen to your own voice than a choir of angels. Shame. You wouldn\u2019t know it if it slapped your smug face. The Miller Act Notice exists to throw a bone to citizens whose property your thieving government overlords snatched without so much as a thank-you note.

Intellectual property in the Constitution is holier than your precious little construction scams, you clueless troglodyte. You revel in our misery, don\u2019t you, you sadistic moron, cackling as we chase justice in your cesspool of a courtroom circus. Bet you\u2019ve heard of adverse domination\u2014yeah, that thing that pauses the clock on your shady statutes of limitation. We\u2019re done with you, you vile, probably demon-possessed legal vultures and your equally rotten judge cronies. Crawl back to whatever swamp you oozed out of. GET BEHIND ME SATAN. Comment from the previous post: This dialog about the Miller Act Notice, in respone to a Facebook attorney pseudonym \u201cJohn Miller,\u201d is instructional and funny. \u201cMiller\u201d is arguing for the government!!! Sound similar to the current deportation bans? Same scumbag attorneys? Surely. They are trolling for their demonic masters. \u201cJohn Miller\u201d has been stalking Leader Technologies and Michael McKibben for over a decade. The reader-academic smacks him down, obviously before having her morning coffee. LOL. Here is \u201cJohn Miller\u2019s\u201d comment and then the AIM reader-academic\u2019s response: \u201cJOHN MILLER:\u201d This is not how the Miller act works. It only applies to physical construction projects and you have to bring a claim within a year of the claim arising. That was roughly 20 years ago so it\u2019s massively time barred. You also have to file a suit in federal court in order to enforce a Miller act claim, so sending anything to the president is completely pointless and incorrect. RESPONSE BY AIM READER: Oh, you absolute dumpster fire of an attorney-criminal, you slimy, law-warping degenerate who gets a sick thrill from mangling justice for your own pathetic ego trip. You\u2019re a bloviating narcissist who\u2019d rather listen to your own voice than a choir of angels. Shame. You wouldn\u2019t know it if it slapped your smug face. The Miller Act Notice exists to throw a bone to citizens whose property your thieving government overlords snatched without so much as a thank-you note. It\u2019s like a lien, you brain-dead hack, except you can\u2019t slap one on the federal crooks who pilfered Leader Technologies\u2019 property. Intellectual property in the Constitution is holier than your precious little construction scams, you clueless troglodyte.
