Webinars Daily Briefing **DeBriefed 6 June 2025: Nigeria\u2019s deadly flash floods; UK\u2019s record spring drives solar surge; Lessons from Japan\u2019s \u2018Cool Biz\u2019** Welcome to Carbon Brief\u2019s DeBriefed.An essential guide to the week\u2019s key developments relating to climate change. **This week** **Deadly extremes** FLOODING:Up to 700 people are believed to have been killed by flash floods in Nigeria, reportedBBC News. Northern Nigeria has faced \u201cprolonged dry spells worsened by climate change\u201d, followed by \u201cexcessive rainfall\u201d, which can cause flash flooding, reported theAssociated Press. FIRES:In Canada, continuing wildfires forced the evacuation of more than 26,000 people, \u201cwith heavy smoke choking millions of Canadians and Americans and reaching as far away as Europe\u201d, reportedLe Monde.CBC Newsreported that authorities in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan have been \u201cbattling the worst wildfire [the state has] seen in decades\u201d. Scientist Prof Colin Laroque told the broadcaster: \u201cThis is classic climate change\u2026This is our new normal.\u201d DEVASTATION:In northeastern India, at least 48 people have been killed in flash floods,Al Jazeerareported. Meanwhile, in China\u2019s southwestern Yunnan province, heavy rainfall over the weekend triggered \u201cflash floods and mudslides\u201d, damaging roads and disrupting power supplies to around 5,000 people, reportedReuters. **Trumping at the bit** DRILL, BABY, DRILL:The Trump administration in the US announced plans to eliminate Biden-era protections across millions of acres of the Alaskan Arctic, opening the area up for drilling and mining \u201cin some of the last remaining pristine wilderness in the country\u201d, theNew York Timesreported. According to US energy secretary, Chris Wright, Trump wants to \u201cdouble the amount of oil coursing through Alaska\u2019s vast pipeline system\u201d and build a \u201cmassive natural gas project as its \u2018big beautiful twin\u2019\u201d, reported theAssociated Press. \u2018GOLD STANDARD\u2019:Elsewhere, more than 6,000 scientists and academics signed an open letter opposing a new push by Trump to impose what he called a restoration of \u201cgold standard science\u201d across federal agencies and national laboratories, reported the theNew York Times. It explained: \u201cThe executive order puts his political appointees in charge of vetting scientific research and gives them the authority to \u2018correct scientific information\u2019, control the way it is communicated to the public and the power to \u2018discipline\u2019 anyone who violates the way the administration views science.\u201d Meanwhile,CNNreported that \u201cNASA scientists describe \u2018absolute sh*tshow\u2019 at agency as Trump budget seeks to dismantle top US climate lab\u201d. **Around the world** BIG TECH:Meta signed a 20-year deal with an Illinois nuclear plant for energy to power its AI and data centres, reported theFinancial Times. BIG SOLAR:Builders will be required to fit solar panels to the \u201cvast majority\u201d of new-build homes in England under changes to be published this year, according to energy secretary Ed Miliband, saidBBC News. BIG TARGET:The EU\u2019s climate science adviser warned the bloc against watering down climate targets, a day after it was reported that EU climate commissioner Wopke Hoekstra \u201csuccessfully lobbied Germany\u2019s coalition government to endorse a controversial measure that weakens the EU\u2019s next climate target\u201d, saidPolitico. BIG PROBEL\u00c9M:Civil society groups raised the alarm on how the \u201cexorbitant price of accommodation\u201d and \u201chigh cost of flights\u201d will undermine Brazil\u2019s civil society participation at COP30 in Bel\u00e9m, reportedDialogue Earth. **$2.2 trillion** How much global investment in clean-energy technologies, including renewables, nuclear and energy storage, is expected in 2025, according to the International Energy Agency. This is \u201ctwice the amount expected for fossil fuels\u201d, reportedReuters. **Latest climate research** A study inCommunications Earth & Environmentwarned that the world has \u201clikely\u201d already reached a tipping point in the West Antarctic ice sheet and that its collapse would result in four metres of sea level rise over a timescale that \u201ccould be millennia\u201d. Nature Communicationspublished research which found that poor air quality in Europe could lead to 282,000 premature deaths a year by 2100 under a low-ambition climate scenario \u2013 but drop to 67,000 if ambitious action is taken to cut emissions. Climate change-driven atmospheric evaporative demand \u2013 sometimes known as \u201catmospheric thirst\u201d \u2013 caused around 40% of increased drought severity globally from 1981-2022, according to new research inNature. (For more, see Carbon Brief\u2019s in-depth daily summaries of the top climate news stories onMonday,Tuesday,Wednesday,ThursdayandFriday.) **Captured** The UK\u2019s sunniest spring generated a record amount of solar power, according to newCarbon Briefanalysis. The data revealed that the nation\u2019s solar sites generated a record 7.6 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity from January to May 2025. This is 42% higher than the 5.4TWh generated in the same period last year, as well as marking a much larger 160% increase over the past decade, the analysis said. It added: \u201cThe solar electricity generated in 2025 to date has avoided the need to import gas costing around \u00a3600m, which would have released 6m tonnes of carbon dioxide (MtCO2) when burned.\u201d TheTimesandBBC Newscovered the analysis. **Spotlight** **Lessons from 20 years of Japanese \u2018Cool Biz\u2019** This week, Carbon Brief examines a \u201ccasual dress\u201d policy that has been \u201csurprisingly effective\u201d at driving emissions savings in Japan. For many people, the thought of Japan conjures up images of thronging cities, bright lights and smartly dressed \u201csalary-men\u201d unwinding in an \u201cizakaya\u201d (Japanese pub) after a gruelling day at the office. Every morning, in cities around Japan, some 38 million office workers put on a uniform of suits and ties and make their way to work. Come summer, however, and the morning commute adopts a laid-back Friday feel. Men\u2019s suit jackets and neckties are replaced by open collars and short sleeves. Venture to the southern island of Okinawa and you might spot a salary-man in a Hawaiian-style \u201ckariyushi\u201d shirt. This was not always the case. Twenty years ago this month, then-environment minister Yuriko Koike introduced Japan \u2013 and the world \u2013 to the term \u201cCool Biz\u201d. \u201cCool Biz\u201d \u2013 literally Cool Business \u2013 is an enduring campaign aimed at reducing energy consumption from air conditioning in the hot summer months when temperatures routinely exceed 30C. **\u2018No necktie\u2019** Introduced in 2005, the same year theKyoto protocolfinally \u201centered into force\u201d, Cool Biz mandated that government office buildings turn down the air conditioning to 28C and encourage employees to cool off by wearing less formal clothing. The campaign was characterised by the pithy slogan: \u201cNo jacket, no necktie.\u201d The impact was near immediate. Byofficial estimates, nearly half a million tonnes of CO2 were saved in the first year of Cool Biz. The following year the savingstripled.In 2012, the policy was estimated to have saved Japan2.2 MtCO2of emissions. (This is equivalent to theemissions of Montenegrothat year.) While temperature regulations were only mandated in government buildings, the impacts of the campaign extended far wider. Thanks to a widespread publicity campaign \u2013 which included a Cool Biz fashion show of Japanese public figures and business leaders \u2013 name recognition reached 96% in its first year, according to a survey by theMinistry of Environment. Uniqlo, Japan\u2019s largest clothes retailer, recorded a14% sales bump\u2013 which it attributed to its range of Cool Biz-appropriate casual workwear. And the Federation of Japanese Necktie Unionspetitioned the government, after it forecast a 30% sales slump worth approximately \u00a31bn. **\u2018Accidental steering\u2019** Twenty years on, working in relaxed attire in summer has become \u201cfirmly established in Japanese society\u201d, Atsushi Watabe, programme director of sustainable consumption and production at Japan\u2019s Institute for Global Environmental Strategies, told Carbon Brief. But research into its popularity revealed that concerns about climate change are unlikely to have played a major role in the uptake. Surveys with members of the public found that Cool Biz had little or no impact on peoples\u2019 reported environmental awareness or commitment, according to Prof Elizabeth Shove, an emeritus professor of sociology at Lancaster University, Cool Biz\u2019s actual success was a case of \u201caccidental steering\u201d through a combination of social, material and historical factors, said Shove. Government officials led by example, she said. Japan\u2019s then prime minister Junchiro Koizumi insisted that Cool Biz be worn for cabinet meetings and appeared in interviews in open-collar shirts. \u201cIf the ministers are wearing a tie, their subordinates would feel uneasy about not wearing it,\u201d prime minister Koizumi said at the time. \u201cSo the ministers should not wear a tie.\u201d Turning down the air conditioning in government buildings, likewise, set a standard for other businesses to follow. Timing also played a role, according to Watabe. Women working in Japanese offices were some of the earliest to support Cool Biz, having been subjected to cooling conventions adapted for male workers, he said, adding: \u201cGradually, men who had always considered wearing suits outside as the norm also accepted the change and began to feel its benefits.\u201d A key lesson is that the success of Cool Biz came from shifting societal norms rather than targeting the behaviour of individuals, said Shove: \u201cNorms and values don\u2019t just exist \u2013 they come from histories of standards, regulations and building research\u2026 [Cool Biz] was surprisingly effective by not changing individual behavior, but by just setting a new standard in the government\u2019s own buildings and in industry.\u201d **Watch, read, listen** DRILLED:A newpodcast seriesexplored how \u201dGreenpeace, which was only tangentially involved in the Standing Rock [oil pipeline] protests, has been slapped with a $666m bill for damages\u201d. REPUBLICANS \u2018SCARED\u2019:TheGuardianinterviewed former Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders on a wide range of issues, including his thoughts on why some Republicans are \u201cscared\u201d to speak about the reality of climate change.SELLING NEGATIVE EMISSIONS:A feature in theFinancial Timesexamined the \u201cbattle to create a carbon trading market for negative emissions\u201d in the UK. **Coming up** 7 June:Ocean Rise and Coastal Resilience Summit, Nice, France 7-8 June:Blue Economy and Finance Forum, Monaco 9-13 June:Third UN Ocean Conference, Nice, France 11-13 June:Global NDC Conference 2025, Berlin, Germany **Pick of the jobs** Asia Society Policy Institute,senior programme officer, China climate industrial policy| Salary: $58,500-70,000).
