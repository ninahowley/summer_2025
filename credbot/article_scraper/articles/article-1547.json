The book\u2019s title was: \u201cElon Musk and the Quest for a Fantastic Future, Young Readers Edition.\u201d It was authored by then Bloomberg/Businessweek writer, Ashlee Vance, and based on his New York Times bestseller for adults, \u201cElon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX and The Quest for a Fantastic Future.\u201d Curiously, however, the book wasn\u2019t for U.S. children or even children on the same continent. The State Department award went to an organization called Steps to Success Public Association in Karakol, Kyrgyzstan. Thefederal account from which the $17,054 contract came was USAID, the federal agency that has been gutted and reputationally savaged as riddled with fraud, waste and abuse by Elon Musk. The Associated Press, which is now banned from White House press conferences by the Trump administration,reported on February 3that Musk had said this recently about USAID: \u201cIt became apparent that it\u2019s not an apple with a worm in it. What we have is just a ball of worms. You\u2019ve got to basically get rid of the whole thing. It\u2019s beyond repair. We\u2019re shutting it down.\u201d The U.S. State Department carries this statement on Kyrgyzstan: \u201cThe United States established diplomatic relations with Kyrgyzstan in 1991 following the nation\u2019s independence from the Soviet Union. The United States supports Kyrgyzstan in its development of an inclusive democracy based upon the rule of law and respect for human rights. Kyrgyzstan\u2019s 2017 presidential election marked the first peaceful transfer of presidential power from one democratically-elected president to another in post-Soviet Central Asia. Significant impediments to Kyrgyzstan\u2019s development include corruption, aging infrastructure, high unemployment that fuels labor migration and dependence on remittances, and endemic poverty. Kyrgyzstan, however, benefits from a robust civil society and a relatively free media sector.\u201d Despite Musk receiving billions of dollars in classified federal contracts through his rocket and satellite company, SpaceX, the Wall Street Journal broke the bombshell news in the fall of last year that Musk has been secretly speaking with Vladimir Putin since 2022 \u2013 despite Putin being on a U.S. sanction list and Musk holding classified information about U.S. technology development. The speed at which Musk has endeavored to get into the computer systems of USAID, shut it down, and even strip its name from its building \u2013 raises the question as to what exactly resides in those files that Musk and/or Trump are so hell bent on keeping from the American people. Musk may rue the day that he and his chainsaw came into the crosshairs of Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), the former Harvard Law Professor who is the ranking member of the U.S. Senate Banking Committee. Warren and Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR), ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee, have received acknowledgement from the Government Accountability Office (GAO), thatit has opened an investigationinto Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) for it tapping into the computers that run the payment system of the U.S. Treasury. Today, at 2 p.m., Warren has convened a forum in the Senate Dirksen Office Building in Washington, D.C. to investigate the consequences of President Trump\u2019s and Elon Musk\u2019s efforts to eliminate the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), the federal agency that has returned over $21 billion to Americans who have been scammed by mortgage lenders, credit card companies, megabanks and other financial predators.

From December 2007 through July 2010, the Federal Reserve secretly funneled $16.1 trillion in emergency revolving loans to the megabanks on Wall Street and their foreign counterparts at below-market interest rates. The Fed took this action without a single vote in Congress. The Fed then battled in court for more than two years to keep these unprecedented giveaways a secret from the American people. It lost on its arguments for secrecy at both the U.S. District and Appellate Court level. The U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear a related case advocating secrecy that was brought by a megabank front group, the Clearing House Association.Instead of punishment for their corrupt actions that crashed the U.S. economy in 2008, the Wall Street megabanks were rewarded with secret bailouts.The Dodd-Frank financial reform legislation of 2010 was supposed to stop these trillion-dollar giveaways from the Fed to the one percent on Wall Street. But the trillion-dollar bailouts at the Fed started up again on September 17, 2019 in the form of emergency repo loans.The Fed\u2019s emergency repo loan operations came months before the COVID-19 virus had emerged in China or anywhere else in the world. That strongly suggests to us that Wall Street megabanks had a serious problem independent of the virus outbreak.Mainstream media refused to cover the repo loan bailouts in any depth, and censored the details when the Fed was forced under law to reveal that it had, once again, funneled trillions of dollars in revolving loans to Wall Street in the fourth quarter of 2019 and beyond.The Fed\u2019s multi-trillion-dollar emergency bailout programs from 2008 were reactivated again for the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, marking the third massive bailout of Wall Street by the Fed in a dozen years.This is unprecedented in the 111-year history of the Fed, meaning the financial system of the U.S. is dramatically on the wrong course.Wall Street On Paradeviews these Fed bailouts as an integral part of an institutionalized wealth transfer system from the 99 percent to the 1 percent.For our ongoing archive of articles on the Fed\u2019s unprecedented bailouts, click on this text.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ From December 2007 through July 2010, the Federal Reserve secretly funneled $16.1 trillion in emergency revolving loans to the megabanks on Wall Street and their foreign counterparts at below-market interest rates.
