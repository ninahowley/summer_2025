And right now, life is good after combining to win four titles at the 2025 Montana High School Rodeo Finals last weekend. \u201cI told my parents \u2026 I was like, \u2018I want to go out with a bang on my last high school rodeo of my life,\u2019\u201d AJ Swenson told MTN Sports in the family\u2019s backyard. Watch the video below to see AJ and Aspen Swenson in action: And he did just that, earning the boys' all-around title at the finals last Saturday. His sister, Aspen, matched him by winning the girls' all-around title. \u201cI don\u2019t know \u2026 (if) that\u2019s ever been done with two siblings winning it the same year,\u201d Aspen said. If so, the achievement hasn't been seen in decades. MTN Sports first showed the Swensons making headlinesin October during the fall rodeo season. Both were coming off outstanding summers\u2014 AJ filled with fire and Aspen, who loves fashion, showcasing a Little Britches world title. Fast forward to last week, when neither all-around title was a sure thing for the Swensons. Both Aspen and AJ opened the finals sitting in second place. A pivotal moment in AJ\u2019s all-around victory arrived in the calf roping\u2019s championship round. \u201c(The calf) came out and took a step left like he was supposed to, and he was supposed to keep going left. As soon as he took that step right, which he hadn\u2019t done, I just knew it was game over,\u201d AJ recalled. Indeed, it was. AJ won the calf roping short go. While polishing one of his many championship saddles, he paused to humbly admit that two recently earned scholarships fill him with the most pride. \u201cThis is based off of what kind of a person you are and not how good you can rope,\u201d he said while holding the two certificates. \u201cIf people can remember me as being a good upstanding guy helping the next generation in and out of the arena, that means more to me than any saddle or buckles ever will.\u201d Aspen not only won the all-around title but is also the latest champion in both breakaway roping and goat tying, giving her the chance to let her older brother hear about it. \u201cI didn\u2019t really brag. \u2026 I mean, I could have, but I didn\u2019t. Thought I\u2019d better stay humble,\u201d Aspen said with a laugh. While she stayed humble, their parents, Sarah and Andy, had knots in the stomach. \u201cOh, I wanted to throw up. I was terrible,\u201d Sarah admitted without hesitation. \u201cYou just pray for your kids to have focus and clarity and to compete to the best of their abilities.\u201d Andy, who\u2019s not always able to travel to competitions, wasn\u2019t about to miss these finals. \u201cIt was very touching knowing that it was AJ\u2019s last night of school rodeo. And all the ones I\u2019ve missed \u2026 I can\u2019t get those back,\u201d Andy said, fighting back tears. Both siblings are qualified for next month\u2019s High School National Finals in Rock Springs, Wyo. After that, AJ will head south to join the Cisco College Wranglers. \u201cIf you were to throw a dart at the dead center of Texas, you\u2019d probably hit it,\u201d AJ said of the location. There\u2019s one more title addition to this story: Boomer, the horse borrowed from family friends who has been good to both AJ and Aspen. \u201cHe\u2019s an old man. He\u2019s 20 years old this year,\u201d Aspen said while standing alongside him. Age didn\u2019t stop Boomer from earning horse of the year honors last weekend. \u201cMy best friend \u2026 she was just crowned the queen. I was getting my breakaway award and told her, \u2018If Boomer wins horse of the year, I might actually cry. That\u2019ll probably be the one that means the most.\u2019 And sure enough, it was,\u201d Aspen said. \u201cSince he did so good, I thought I\u2019d spoil him with a Louis Vuitton halter. And it\u2019s turquoise, the color he looks best in,\u201d Aspen added with a laugh. Who knows when Boomer will retire, but right now, the grass is certainly greener for him \u2014 and for the Swensons. **Sign up for theBreaking News Newsletterand receive up to date information.** **now signed up to receive theBreaking NewsNewsletter.** **Coverage of your favorite teams from Montana's Sports Leader** **Coverage of your favorite teams from Montana's Sports Leader** News Weather Community Sports Don't Waste Your Money Support Sitemap Do Not Sell My Info Privacy Policy Privacy Center Journalism Ethics Guidelines Terms of Use EEO Careers FCC Public File FCC Application Public File Contact Us Accessibility Statement Scripps Media Trust Center Closed Captioning Contact Q2News/ ktvq ktvq"}
