Overall, the union made over $33 million worth of red-flag-raising expenses \u2013 including $11.46 million on hotels, over $10 million on advocacy, and almost $3 million on travel. Highlights include: Giving $2.75 million (that\u2019s the yearly average dues of about 2,500 members) to The Fairness Project, an organization that funnels money into ballot initiatives \u2013 mostly outside of the area that UHW represents. $2 million paid to a single political consulting firm. Spending $15,704 on a \u201cretreat\u201d at five-star hotel Langham Huntington. Spending $4.5 million on UHW\u2019s political arm.

It raises the question, is UHW splurging on hotels for its staff? You can read the full factsheethere.
