Congressman Raises a \u2018Few Cows\u2019 As a Hobby, And Says It\u2019s Legitimate To Promote Himself in Politics As a \u2018Rancher\u2019** In May, Patrick Henry College founder Michael Farris introduced the school\u2019s 2025 commencement speaker, U.S. Rep. Gabe Evans (R-CO) and his wife, as the \u201cowners and operators of a family farm in the southern part of Weld County, Colorado, where they\u2019re raising their two boys, who are delightful young men.\u201d Evans refers to himself as a rancher on hiscongressional website, with some of the same language Farris used. \u201cAs a beef producer myself, I have the backs of our farmers and ranchers who are feeding the world,\u201d says Evans on the website, which pictures the congressman in a black cowboy hat face-to-face with a longhorn cow. It\u2019s an appealing image in American politics \u2014 especially in a mostly rural district like the one Evans represents. Hobby Ranch The issue is, Evans raises just a few cattle and thinks of his longhorn operation as a hobby. Yet, with an apparent eye on voters in his agricultural district, Evans issues a steady stream of political communications \u2014 beyond what\u2019s on his website \u2014 about his agricultural activities, leading one Colorado rancher who served in Congress to describe Evans as \u201call hat, no cattle.\u201d Evans dismisses the concerns out of hand. \u201cWhile the Left wastes time and taxpayer dollars questioning the validity of the Evans\u2019 family farm, Congressman Gabe Evans is fighting serious battles to make Colorado a better place to live, work, and raise a family,\u201d Evans spokeswoman Delanie Bomar said via email, adding that Evans made $1,100 on agricultural products last year and thus meets a federal definition of a rancher. Does he think he should call himself a rancher or beef producer in promotional/political communications, given that his farm is, as he\u2019s said, a hobby? \u201cYes, he does,\u201d replied Bomar, \u201cbecause by the [U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s (USDA)] definition, he is a rancher. Don\u2019t just take it from him \u2013 the USDA agrees.\u201d Hobby Cattle Asked last year byEl Commercioto talk about his \u201chobbies,\u201d Evans brought up his longhorns. \u201cI really like longhorn cattle,\u201d Evans toldEl Commercio Nov. 24. \u201cMy grandma raised Longhorns, and when she got too old to ranch anymore, she gave me the last couple of cattle that she had. So I raise a few cows now. I don\u2019t have a lot of land. I can raise like two or three cows a year, but I really like Longhorn cattle. I really like raising them and, you know, I enjoy that lifestyle.\u201d Citing his cows and sometimes an orchard, Evans has promoted himself as a rancher and farmer throughout his political career. \u201cRancher Running for the Statehouse\u201d was theheadlinein Evans\u2019 hometown newspaper, theFt. Lupton Press,when Evans first announced he was running for the state Legislature in 2022. The article quoted Evans as saying, \u201cI live on a small farm between Brighton and Fort Lupton, I\u2019m a small business owner, raise beef cattle, poultry, and grow a variety of fruit and berries from an orchard I planted.\u201d On the homepage of his state House campaign website, Evans presented himself in a cowboy hat with a longhorn, using the same photo that\u2019s on his congressional website today. In his 2022 legislative race, Evans faced Terry DeGroot, whomanagesColorado Cow, a serious dairy farm that distributes milk to Natural Grocers, Whole Foods, and other locations,according to its website. During DeGroot\u2019s race against Evans, DeGroot\u2019s supportersreportedlymocked Evans as owning \u201cpet cows\u201d rather than running a serious ranch or farm like the one run by DeGroot, who\u2019s now a Weld County commissioner. Asked how he felt about Evans\u2019 portrayal of himself as a rancher, DeGroot told theColorado Times Recorder, \u201cI don\u2019t know anything about his farming history.\u201d Evans won his state House race in 2022, and during his subsequent two years at the Legislature, he continued reinforcing his image as a rancher-politician, repeatedly posting photos of himself and his longhorns on social media. \u201cCows got some extra feed to keep their body temp up,\u201d Evanswrote on Facebookduring a cold snap, flashing a photo of his cattle, after he was elected in 2022. A2023 Facebook post, which pictured Evans\u2019 family with a calf, stated, \u201cOne of my cows finally timed the weather correctly and had her calf on a nice day.\u201d In a2024 Facebook post, Evans gave a \u201cshoutout to Colorado Custom Meat Company,\u201d which, he wrote, \u201calways take care of me and my small ag operation.\u201d \u201cRanchers Like Me\u201d Evanscontinueddroppingreferencesto his cattle in his congressional race last year against incumbent Democrat Yadira Caraveo \u2014 with his campaign offering rancher shots of the candidate. During a debate against Caraveo, for example, CBS4\u2019s Shaun Boyd asked if enough is being done to keep food safe in the U.S., and Evans replied, \u201cI\u2019m a beef producer. I actually contribute to the food supply by producing pasture-raised, grass-fed beef. I take it to a USDA-inspected facility.\u201d \u201cMy family and I raise cattle. But to the Democrats, ranchers like me are \u2018lazy\u2019 and \u2018nasty,'\u201d hewroteduring the campaign. \u201cGround beef is around $5/lb (if you can find it), but the Left can\u2019t seem to figure out it\u2019s their war on rural Colorado that\u2019s causing food prices to skyrocket.\u201d The Koch-funded group, Americans for Prosperity, a major supporter of Evans,placed adspicturing Evans with his Longhorns, using images from his campaign website. Voters\u2019 perception of Evans as a rancher in his northern Colorado congressional district could easily have contributed to his 2,449-vote win over Caraveo \u2014 which turned out to be among the closest U.S. House races in the country. Agriculture is a key industry in Evans\u2019 district. It\u2019s the 21st highest cattle-producing congressional district in the country, and ranks 101stamong congressional districtsin the market value of all agricultural products sold. Colorado\u2019s 8th Congressional District, which is mostly north and east of Denver, contains 325,000 cattle and calves; the average farm there sells $721,000 worth of agricultural products. \u201cI would not be so arrogant to say that I\u2019m a rancher.\u201d After Evans was elected to Congress, he put his cattle under the care of Chuck Hughes,who runs Cwm Ceffyl Ranch. \u201cGabe, keep up the good work and don\u2019t let the constant mud the lefties throw at you be discouraging,\u201d Hughes wrote to Evans on Facebook. \u201cHere\u2019s a peaceful scene of your cattle. I am enjoying them. They\u2019re doing well.\u201d Reached by phone, Hughes said he\u2019s \u201cboarding\u201d three animals for Evans \u2014 a cow, heifer, and a young bull calf. \u201cI\u2019m happy to help him out,\u201d he said. He\u2019ll give the longhorns back to Evans when he returns to Colorado or \u201cwhenever he might want them,\u201d but Hughes hopes Evans shakes up Washington while he\u2019s there. \u201cI hope he spends about the next 50 years in Washington, D.C., helping the country come back to sanity,\u201d said Hughes. \u201cSo I hope I have them for a good long time. \u2026 I think he\u2019s great for the country.\u201d Hughes described his own agricultural operation as a \u201csmall ranch.\u201d According to the ranch\u2019s Facebook page, its cows produced at least 43 calves in 2024. In aninterviewlast year with Consumer News TV, Hughes said he slaughters about a dozen steers annually. \u201cI\u2019m a wannabe rancher,\u201d Hughes said. \u201cI would not be so arrogant to say that I\u2019m a rancher.\u201d \u201cRancher and Veteran\u201d Despite giving up the cattle to Hughes, Evans still promotes himself as a rancher on his websites and social media. In a January X post,he wrote, \u201cAs a rancher and veteran, I\u2019m fighting for our families and American prosperity!\u201d \u2018All Hat No Cattle\u2019 One farmer-turned-congressman from Colorado takes a dim view of Evans promoting himself as a rancher. Former U.S. Rep. John Salazar had about 500 head of cattle when he was elected to Congress in 2004, he told theColorado Times Recorderlast week. \u201cHe\u2019s probably a hobby rancher,\u201d said Salazar of Evans. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t use that to make a living. All hat and no cattle.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sure there\u2019s lots of people who try to do that,\u201d he continued. \u201cHe represents an ag district, so, you know.\u201d Salazar\u2019s ranch near Costilla County in southern Colorado continued operating after Salazar went to Washington. \u201cI farm and rent almost 5,000 acres here, and my boys and my wife kept it going while I was gone to Washington,\u201d said Salazar. \u201cI mean, that\u2019s how we made a living, and I went to Washington to fight for the water. My district, the 3rd Congressional District, is basically ag. They did send a farmer to Congress. \u201cYesterday, I was almost finished planting another field of alfalfa,\u201d said Salazar, who\u2019s 71 years old. \u201cThe rain stopped me about 4 in the afternoon. I won\u2019t be able to get back into the field for another couple days. That\u2019s what farming and ranching is all about. \u2026 Farming and ranching is a hard, hard occupation, but it\u2019s a good one. I love it.\u201d \u201cBy Definition, He Is a Rancher\u201d There\u2019s no evidence that Evans\u2019 agricultural activities provided significant income for his family. In hiscommencement speech last month, Evans talked in detail about his precarious financial position when he left his police job in 2022 to run for the state Legislature. He described how he worked \u201cliterally as a delivery boy\u201d to make money as he ran for office. His job in law enforcement had paid \u201csix figures,\u201d and he worried that there was \u201cno way\u201d he\u2019d be able to \u201cpay a mortgage and feed a family\u201d on the salary he\u2019d get as a state representative. But, he said in his speech, his wife quickly got a job when he quit to run for office, \u201cmaking enough money to survive but not much more.\u201d He did not mention farming or ranching as income generators. In public filings, he\u2019s disclosed income from selling agricultural products over the years, and heavily redacted Livestock Inspection certificates confirm that he sold or gave away an unknown number of cattle in Colorado. In 2023, when he was in the Colorado Legislature, he disclosed that he earned \u201cless than $5,000 annually\u201d from his \u201cfarm business.\u201d In 2021 and 2022, his reports to the Legislature state that he made an unspecified income from the \u201csale of home-grown beef/ag products.\u201d (He\u2019s also beenquoted as sayinghe planted an orchard and grows fruit.) Evans\u2019 first twofederal financial disclosure forms, filed as a congressional candidate in 2023 and 2024, list no income whatsoever from ranching or farming. His most recent form, filed last week and not yet available to the public, discloses $1,100, according to his office. It\u2019s the latest disclosure form that Evans\u2019s office points to when asked if Evans is exaggerating his agricultural activities when he says stuff like, \u201cas a rancher,\u201d or \u201cbeef-producer.\u201d \u201cTo meet the USDA requirement, it\u2019s very black and white: ranchers have to make at least $1,000 in profit,\u201d writes Bomar. \u201cSince Congressman Evans meets that requirement, by definition, he is a rancher. There\u2019s no wiggle room for disagreement on such a black and white issue. Additionally, he is a beef producer because he produces and sells the beef. Again, there\u2019s no wiggle room for disagreement on something so black and white.\u201d The USDA uses its definition of a ranch or a farm in its \u201cCensus of Agriculture,\u201d which is a \u201ccomplete count of U.S. farms and ranches and the people who operate them.\u201d Under the USDA\u2019s definition, a small plot of land, in an urban or agricultural area, is defined as a ranch or a farm if it \u201cnormally\u201d generates $1,000 in sales of agricultural products \u2014 which is $100 below what Evans earned last year, according to his office. \u201cEven small plots of land \u2013 whether rural or urban \u2013 count if $1,000 or more of such products were raised and sold, or normally would have been sold, during the census year,\u201dstates the USDA websiteabout the Census of Agriculture, which is taken every five years. Agricultural Tax Breaks Evans\u2019 property in Weld County is designated as \u201cagricultural,\u201d which entitles the congressman ongoing tax breaks. Experts say the key to the agricultural designation \u2014 as a farm or ranch \u2014 is to show monetary profit, and there are a variety of ways,under Colorado\u2019s rules,that an assessor can conclude that a parcel of land should be considered agricultural and receive the resultant tax breaks. Weld County requires that property owners seeking an agricultural designation submit aformto the county, which defines \u201cRanch\u201d as a \u201cparcel of land which is used for grazing livestock for the primary purpose of obtaining a monetary profit.\u201d The form states that land shall not lose its agricultural designation solely based on income criteria. Weld County could provide no record of Evans having filed the form. It appears that the designation of Evans\u2019 land as agricultural was made by the previous owner and carried over to Evans and his wife, as allowed by Weld County. In any case, now that he has no cattle on his land, and he\u2019s claiming on two of his three federal financial disclosures not to make any money from ranching or farming, will Evans continue to take the agricultural land tax break? \u201cThe agricultural land tax break is appropriately used by the Evans family because the land is used for agricultural purposes,\u201d stated Bomar.
