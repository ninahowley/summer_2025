And they\u2019ll once again be able to defeat the asshole who first appeared back inTony Hawk\u2019s Undeground. Off English Off English In a recent videofrom Jeff Gertsmann,as spotted byVGC, he was able to play and stream an early build ofTHPS 3+4and also showcase some b-roll footage of the game from Activision.THPS 3+4is a full remake of the PS2-era gamesTony Hawk\u2019s Pro Skater 3and4, complete with new levels, improved visuals, and more. And it was in this video that Gertsmann revealed that Eric Sparrow fromTony Hawk\u2019s Undergroundmakes an appearance in Waterpark, which is one of the remake\u2019s new levels. Sparrow, sporting a new look, can be found in the waterpark-themed level and is part of an objective titled \u201cGet Back at Eric Sparrow.\u201d When touched, he will push the player and yell at them in a voice that sounds a lot like how he sounded in the OG PS2 game. Sadly, the build Gerstmann was playing didn\u2019t let him actually complete the mission, so we aren\u2019t sure yet how the player will \u201cget back\u201d at theTHUGvillain. It might involve grinding a piece of the map to knock over a large bucket filled with water above Sparrow. If you\u2019ve never playedTHUG, then it\u2019s just a random and odd challenge in a level filled with other things to do. If you have playedTHUG,you\u2019ll remember Sparrow is a real assholewho screwed you over and betrayed you in that game\u2019s campaign. So, is this a tease that Activision and Iron Galaxy have plans to develop a full remake ofTony Hawk\u2019s Underground? Many fans of the series want that to happen.Even Tony Hawk himself has said he\u2019d love a remake ofTHUG. \u201cI always have aspirations,\u201d Hawk toldScreenRantin May. \u201cIt\u2019s not up to me generally. I\u2019ll campaign all I can, but I\u2019m working with a much bigger company that\u2019s a lot smarter than me.\u201d It\u2019s also possible that while developing a brand new level inTHPS 3+4, Iron Galaxy decided to pay tribute to a fan favorite game in the series with a cheeky little cameo. We\u2019ll have to wait and see what happens. ."}
