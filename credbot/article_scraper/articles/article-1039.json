Monica McIver indicted on federal charges from skirmish at NJ immigration center** **** Jun 11, 2025 TRENTON, N.J \u2014 U.S. Rep. LaMonica McIver was indicted Tuesday on federal charges alleging she impeded and interfered with immigration officers outside a New Jersey detention center while Newark\u2019s mayor was being arrested after he tried to join a congressional oversight visit at the facility. Acting U.S. Attorney for New Jersey Alina Habba announced the grand jury indictment in a post on X. \u201cWhile people are free to express their views for or against particular policies, they must not do so in a manner that endangers law enforcement and the communities those officers serve,\u201d Habba said. McIver, a Democrat, had been charged in a complaint by Habba last month with two assault charges stemming from the May 9 visit to Newark\u2019s Delaney Hall \u2014 a 1,000-bed, privately owned facility that Immigration and Customs Enforcement uses as a detention center. McIver disputed the allegations as baseless and defended her presence at the facility as part of her authorized role as a member of Congress. Her lawyer, former U.S. Attorney for New Jersey Paul Fishman, said in a statement that they would challenge the allegations \u201chead-on\u201d in court. \u201cThe legal process will expose this prosecution for what it truly is \u2014 political retaliation against a dedicated public servant who refuses to shy away from her oversight responsibilities,\u201d Fishman said. Habba said two of the counts carry a maximum sentence of up to eight years in prison. A third has a maximum sentence of one year. She characterized the charges as \u201cforcibly impeding and interfering with federal law enforcement officers.\u201d The indictment is the latest development in a legal-political drama that has seen President Donald Trump\u2019s administration take Democratic officials from New Jersey\u2019s largest city to court, tapping into the president\u2019s immigration crackdown and Democrats\u2019 efforts to respond. The prosecution of McIver is a rare federal criminal case against a sitting member of Congress for allegations other than fraud or corruption. At the same visit that resulted in McIver\u2019s charges, Newark Mayor Ras Baraka was arrested on a trespassing charge, which was later dropped. Baraka is suing Habba over what he said was a malicious prosecution. A nearly two-minute clip released by the Homeland Security Department shows McIver on the facility side of a chain-link fence just before the arrest of the mayor on the street side of the fence, where other people had been protesting. She and uniformed officials go through the gate, and she joins others shouting that they should circle the mayor. The video shows McIver in a tightly packed group of people and officers. At one point, her left elbow and then her right elbow push into an officer wearing a dark face covering and an olive green uniform emblazoned with the word \u201cPolice\u201d on it. It isn\u2019t clear from police bodycam video whether that contact was intentional, incidental or a result of jostling in the chaotic scene. The complaint says she \u201cslammed\u201d her forearm into an agent then tried to restrain the agent by grabbing him. New Jersey Reps. Bonnie Watson Coleman and Rob Menendez had joined McIver at the detention center that day. They and Democrats have criticized the arrest and disputed the charges as well. By law, members of Congress are authorized to go into federal immigration facilities as part of their oversight powers, even without notice. Congress passed a 2019 appropriations bill that spelled out the authority. **Newsletter** **National News** **National News** **US stocks drift closer to their record as Wall Street waits to see what US-China talks will bear** **US stocks drift closer to their record as Wall Street waits to see what US-China talks will bear** NEW YORK \u2014 U.S. stocks drifted closer to their all-time high on Tuesday as the wait continued to hear what ... **Trump\u2019s tax bill could raise taxes on foreign companies, hurting investment from abroad** **Trump\u2019s tax bill could raise taxes on foreign companies, hurting investment from abroad** WASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump likes to say he\u2019s bringing in trillions of dollars in investments from ... **National** **National** Federal immigration raid at Omaha food production plant sparks protests OMAHA, Neb.
