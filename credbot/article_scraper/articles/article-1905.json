Trump issued a stark warning: \u201cThe 25th Amendment is of zero risk to me, but will come back to haunt Joe Biden and the Biden administration. As the expression goes, \u201cBe careful what you wish for\u201d. Nearly four years later, that warning has materialized with disturbing clarity. President Joe Biden\u2019s cognitive decline, operational failures, and policy missteps have deeply damaged American security, global credibility, and have cost countless lives. Vice President Kamala Harris\u2014armed with the constitutional authority to intervene under the 25th Amendment\u2014stood idle. The signs of Biden\u2019s unfitness were never subtle. Surfacing now are reports such as those from Senator Josh Hawley, who relayed a Secret Service agent\u2019s account that Biden would sometimes\u201cget lost in his closet\u201d in the mornings, reflecting a White House operating in quiet crisis. Public appearances were stage-managed at best, if we were lucky enough for then-President Joe Biden to find his way off the stage, press interactions were rare and filtered, and speeches frequently were derailed by confusion or memory lapses. TheHur Reportaudio details a devastating situation that revealed the utter mental collapse of our then-Commander-in-Chief.EvenCNN\u2019s Jake Tapper admitted,\u201cIt is a scandal. It is without question \u2013 and maybe even worse than Watergate in some ways\u201d. But Harris\u2019s inaction is completely indefensible when viewed through the lens of Biden\u2019s policy disasters. The botched withdrawal from Afghanistan in August of 2021 resulted in the deaths of 13 U.S. service members, the abandonment of American citizens and allies, and the surrender of billions in military equipment to the Taliban. Biden, at the near inception of his presidency, was visibly confused and disengaged in the aftermath and completely failed to project leadership at a moment of international crisis. Where was the mainstream media to hold Biden accountable? Silent. Allegedly, Kamala Harris was busy with her border czar duties\u2026another mess that President Donald J. Trump is having to clean up\u2026and with great resistance from the judiciary! Then came Biden\u2019s rescinding of sanctions of President Donald Trump\u2019s restored U.N. sanctions onIran. Additionally, Biden waived sanctions on the company building the controversial gas pipeline between Russia and Germany, theNord Stream 2 pipeline,and also lifted sanctions on the executive, an ally of Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin, who led the firm behind the Nord Stream 2 project. For those who have read the infamousBurisma Report, this should come as no shock. These weren\u2019t just geopolitical miscalculations\u2014they were lethal accelerants. Lifting pressure off Tehran empowered a regime that ultimately backed and funded Hamas and Hezbollah, ultimately leading to the barbaric October 7th attacks on Israel. Ending sanctions on Nord Stream 2 emboldened Putin, clearing the path for the invasion of Ukraine, where hundreds of thousands have died. These weren\u2019t coincidences; they were the predictable results of appeasement masquerading as diplomacy\u2014led by a president whose judgment and cognitive capacity were all in serious question. Meanwhile, Vice President Harris stood by and watched these deadly decisions being made. Then there\u2019s the cultural and constitutional confusion that has highlighted more of Biden\u2019s mental incapacity, of which American girls nationwide are suffering from (and yet another problem that President Trump has to fix). On March 22, 2022, during the confirmation hearing for Supreme Court nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson, Sen. Marsha Blackburn asked a straightforward question:\u201cCan you define the word \u2018woman\u2019?\u201d Jackson\u2019s reply:\u201cI can\u2019t\u2026 I\u2019m not a biologist.\u201d That moment\u2014broadcast for the world\u2014crystallized a seismic issue. If a Supreme Court justice nominee cannot or will not define something as basic and foundational as what a woman is, how can we trust anything that the Biden Administration did without a full and complete investigation intoevery single decision. \u200b\u200bFurther, the open-border disaster has brought consequences far beyond policy miscalculations. Under the Biden-Harris administration, over7.3 million illegal immigrants have crossed into our country\u2014including thousands from known criminal networks such as the Venezuelan-basedTren de Araguagang. Many lives have been lost from Biden\u2019s failures.Laken Riley, a Georgia nursing student, andRachel Morin, a Maryland mother of five\u2014were brutally murdered by illegal aliens. Then there was Travis Wolfe, a 12-year-old boy from Missouri, was riding with his parents when their car was struck head-on by illegal alien from Venezuela.These tragedies, among many others, were avoidable and were the direct result of Biden\u2019s reckless open-border policies and Harris\u2019s refusal to act in her designated role as \u201cborder czar\u201d or in her power to invoke the 25thAmendment. This isn\u2019t just about President Biden\u2019s age or verbal slip-ups. It\u2019s about a string of failures\u2014strategic, moral, and constitutional\u2014that have weakened America at home and created chaos abroad. Vice President Kamala Harris, seeing these issues firsthand, had a duty underSection 4 of the 25th Amendmentto act when President Biden became \u201cunable to discharge the powers and duties of his office.\u201d She chosenotto. President Trump did not mince words when he warned the world of Biden\u2019s cognitive decline. The Constitution provided a solution and then-Vice President Kamala Harris ignored both. She preserved political standing at the expense of national security, global stability, and constitutional responsibility. The tragedies that we are facing around the world are the responsibility of those who swore an oath to defend the United States of America and failed to do so. History will not look kindly on this silence. When courage was required, Harris chose complicity. Kamala Harris has no place in politics and she should be held responsible for her failure to invoke the 25th Amendment due to then-President Joe Biden\u2019s mental incapacitation.
