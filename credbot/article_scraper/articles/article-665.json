U.S. \u200b\u200bDistrict Judge Allison Burroughs\u2019 order is an extension of aprevious orderissued against the administration in May after the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)attemptedto revoke Harvard\u2019s eligibility to host students on foreign visas. Trump\u2019s June 4executive orderattempted to skirt the original ruling against the DHS, preventing any new international students intending to attend Harvard from entering the U.S. and directs the Secretary of State to consider revoking the visas of current foreign Harvard students. Trump\u2019s orderclaimed \u201cHarvard has a demonstrated history of concerning foreign ties and radicalism.\u201d Harvard immediatelyvowedto fight back against the order. \u201cSingling out our institution for its enrollment of international students and its collaboration with other educational institutions around the world is yet another illegal step taken by the Administration to retaliate against Harvard,\u201d university president Alan Garberwrotein a community message following the singing of Trump\u2019s order. Harvard did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation\u2019s request for comment. The Obama-appointed judge also oversaw theHarvard v. Students for Fair Admissionscase prior to its reaching the Supreme Court, in which Burroughs allowed Harvard to racially discriminate in its admissions policy. The Trump administration has been targeting the Ivy League university due to its alleged failure to respond to antisemitism on campus and protect Jewish students. Harvard\u2019s owninternal investigationfound that more than a quarter of Jewish students felt \u201cphysically unsafe\u201d on campus and \u201cAlmost 60% of Jewish students reported experiencing \u2018discrimination, stereotyping, or negative bias.\u2019\u201d Despite this, Harvard declined to comply with the Trump administration\u2019s demands to reshape its vetting and admissions process for foreign students and reform its disciplinary processes. The university stated it \u201cwill not surrender\u201d its academic freedom and free speech rights. Along with targeting its foreign students, the administration has also revokedbillionsin federal dollars from Harvard and is working tocut all remaining contractswith the school. The White House did not immediately respond to the DCNF\u2019s request for comment.
