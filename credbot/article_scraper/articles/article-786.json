RELATED:Special session: Undocumented immigrants to be voted off public health insurance, budget passes with hours to spare Republicans argue the change will reduce spending and put Minnesotans first. Democrats believe gutting the benefits will make it more expensive in the long run when immigrants are treated without insurance. The Department of Human Services said as of April 24, at least 15,000 undocumented immigrants, who are adults, are enrolled in MinnesotaCare. \u201cThe prospect of them being eligible for this insurance coverage was greeted with a lot of excitement because we now knew there\u2019d be a source of reimbursement for their care,\u201d Steve Knutson, Neighborhood Healthsource executive director, said. Neighborhood Healthsource treats at least 100 immigrants per month. They welcome uninsured patients, but the cost is at least $250 per visit. After December of this year, the clinic will go back to footing the bill. \u201cSo what it might mean for us is we have to consider closing a site, reducing our staff, or cutting our costs somehow,\u201d Knutson said. \u201cIf you would have looked at this situation four or five years ago, we didn\u2019t have this number of undocumented patients in our midst. Today, we do, and so that\u2019s just more patients whose uncompensated care has to be absorbed in the system.\u201dKnutson said uninsured undocumented immigrants will likely show up to emergency rooms for care in higher numbers, but the cost will still trickle down to Minnesotans. \u201cIt means we\u2019ll pay higher prices for commercial patients who are insured commercially, and we\u2019ll have to help subsidize that. That\u2019s the way the system works, like it or not,\u201d Knutson said. Undocumented adult immigrants who are already enrolled in MinnesotaCare will lose coverage after December of this year. 5 EYEWITNESS NEWS reached out to all the major hospital systems in Minnesota, asking how this will impact costs. We\u2019re still waiting on a response.
