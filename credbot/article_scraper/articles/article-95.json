Directed by Paul Greengrass (\u201cCaptian Phillips,\u201d \u201cThe Bourne Ultimatum\u201d) and produced by Jamie Lee Curtis, \u201cThe Lost Bus\u201d is a dramatization of the 2018 Camp Fire, the deadliest and most destructive wildfire in California history. The film focuses on a bus driver played by Matthew McConaughey who\u2019s tasked with rescuing 23 stranded elementary school students and their teacher (America Ferrera). The trailer is artfully sparse when it comes to details (minus a harrowing glimpse of McConaughey\u2019s school bus weaving through a flame-drenched thicket of trees), but if you listen closely, you\u2019ll recognize Atkinson\u2019s voice as the calm yet authoritative radio dispatcher asking if anyone can \u201cgo and pick these kids up.\u201d Check it out below: According toDeadline, \u201cThe Lost Bus\u201d is based on the book \u201cParadise: One Town\u2019s Struggle to Survive an American Wildfire.\u201d The film is set to release on Apple TV+ and in select theaters in the fall. **It's dragon-slaying time!** In a time when critical voices are increasingly silenced, theArkansas Timesstands as a beacon of truth, tirelessly defending the fundamental rights and freedoms within our community.
