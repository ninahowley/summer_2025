You canregister here X-ray microtomography has emerged as a valuable technique in archaeology for over a decade, aiding in the recording, preservation, and analysis of artifacts. While its application to archaeobotanical remains is well-documented, its use to study archaeological wood charcoal remains limited to preliminary research. Previous studies suggest that microtomography offers limited anatomical detail compared to light microscopy but provides advantages such as automated morphological analysis and reduced observational biases. This study explores the potential of microtomography for anthracological research, particularly in paleoenvironmental reconstructions. It examines anatomical traits in archaeological charcoal and assesses the viability of 3D imaging for quantifying structural characteristics like vulnerability index and the presence of mineral bodies. Ten Amazonian wood charcoal samples were analyzed using controlled carbonization, followed by imaging and data processing. Results indicate that 3D imaging yields comparable insights to 2D analysis while being more efficient. The study highlights the benefits of volumetric data in vulnerability index calculations and crystal quantification, providing greater accuracy than traditional 2D methods. While further validation is needed, microtomography shows promise in enhancing the speed and reliability of anthracological studies.
