Half of the time, it\u2019s a place of beginnings, tense or exciting or dread-filling. It\u2019s the last thing a homeowner sees when leaving a home, and it\u2019s the first thing a homeowner sees when returning home. It\u2019s the interior of the car park, the car hole, the auto stable, the spencer, the parkade, the Chevy levy, the Ford fjord, the Batcave, the place where dad sleeps when mom has had enough of his shenanigans \u2014 in the Land of 10,000 Lakes, it\u2019s usually called \u201cthe garage,\u201d and it\u2019s most often treated like an afterthought by its owner \u2026 but more and more, Minnesotans are moving their garages to their forebrains, upgrading from the bottom up. Savage, Minn.-based, Twin Cities-serving Garage Floor Outfitters, as their name suggests, might serve as a dependable partner in such endeavors. \u201cWe install custom, high-quality solutions for garage floors,\u201d declares Bob Davis, the company\u2019s owner. \u201cPeople want to re-do their garage floors and get organized.\u201d The most basic, most obvious, most elemental of such solutions is a coating of the space\u2019s lowest horizons. In years past, epoxy and polyaspartic resin have been, despite their giant-movie-monster-sounding names, the most popular options for such treatments. In recent times, however, a new colossus has established its dominance. \u201cPolyaspartic is a UV-stable resin that looks like epoxy but has a chemical makeup that allows it to set much more quickly,\u201d elucidates a website dedicated to the topic. \u201cWhen it contains 100% aliphatic material, a polyaspartic garage coating prevents the fading or yellowing that occurs over time with epoxy coatings.\u201d Translated from Madscientistese, this new product forms pleasing chemical compounds whose invisible chains solidify faster and last longer than its predecessors. Garage Floor Outfitters\u2019 own website elaborates: \u201cOur polyaspartic garage floor coatings can be installed and fully dried in as little as one day. With quick installation and drying times, your floors will look exceptional while standing up to heavy use.\u201d The floors having achieved such a dark and pristine condition, keeping non-cars off of them might be advisable. Happily, Garage Floor Outfitters outfits more than just garage floors. As their website promises, \u201cWe offer tailored solutions for residential or commercial use to meet your unique needs.\u201d Those unique needs might be addressed, at least in part, with the installation of cabinets. \u201cWe carry both the plywood Classic series and the metal Tech series by [top brand] Slide-Lok Garage Interiors & Closet System,\u201d the company\u2019s website explains. \u201cOther cabinets made of particle board don\u2019t last in garage environments where moisture can lead to their early demise.\u201d The purpose of the treatment is the opposite of an early demise. As the website further assures, \u201cUsing floor coating products such as Slide-Lok\u2019s polyaspartic, patch repair, moisture barrier, and joint filler solutions, we can improve and preserve your floor for a lifetime of demanding use.\u201d The vertical surfaces themselves might lend to the storage efforts of the thoroughly Bob Vila-esque in the form of slat walls. Say Garage Floor Outfitters, \u201c[Slat walls] are built only from strong and durable material, feature hooks that can up to one hundred pounds, and are available in custom sizes and configurations.\u201d And, of course, the floor\u2019s distant parallel needn\u2019t be left out of the act \u2014 ceiling racks are also an option. \u201cStrong Racks is the manufacturer of the world\u2019s strongest and safest ceiling storage racks for your garage,\u201d the company website boasts. \u201cThese garage overhead storage racks are capable of holding the highest weight capacities in the entire industry of overhead storage systems.\u201d Although owner Bob Davis has noticed that the general public has, in recent years, gained an appreciation of the house\u2019s carpark, one improbable demographic has loomed over all the rest. \u201cYou\u2019d be surprised \u2014 single women in their 40s most often want their garages decked out,\u201d owner Davis observes thoughtfully. Then he adds with a wry laugh, \u201cThey\u2019re the ones with the money \u2014 women in their forties rule the world!\u201d Once the work is done, the cupboard-covered walls might resemble a metal or wooden chessboard intended for giant monsters with unpronounceable names and long attention spans. However it\u2019s processed, the end result can be a unified concept that changes a house\u2019s garage into more than just the end of a journey or the beginning of a journey \u2014 the end result can tell the ultimate story of the ultimate destination \u2026 it can tell the story of home.
