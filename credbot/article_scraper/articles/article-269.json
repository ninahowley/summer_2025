(The Grayzone) ByKit KlarenbergThe Grayzone During an end-of-year investor call this February, Palantir CEO, co-founder and militant Zionist Alex Karpbraggedthat his company was making a financial killing by enabling mass murder. \u201cPalantir is here to disrupt and make the institutions we partner with the very best in the world and, when it\u2019s necessary, to scare enemies,\u201d he stated, adding: \u201cAnd on occasion, kill them.\u201d CIA seed front company Palantir\u2019s CEO Alex Karp brags about how good business is to shareholders while admitting .. \u201cWhen it\u2019s necessary to scare enemies and on occasion kill them ..

Some people are going to get their heads cut off,\u201d he warned, suggesting that his firm was producing the most vital technology enabling elites to restore control during the coming unrest. Denver-based Palantir [which specializes in software platforms for big-data analytics] is already playing a decisive role in the besieged Gaza Strip, whereits productsassist Israel\u2019s application of a ferocious AI targeting system known asLavenderwhich directs its ongoing genocide. In the face of public protest, Karp hasacknowledgedthat he is directly involved in killing Palestinians in Gaza, but insisted the dead were \u201cmostly terrorists.\u201d Karp at the World Economic Forum in May 2022 in Davos-Klosters, Switzerland.(World Economic Forum / Flickr, CC BY-NC-SA 2.0 ) At the start of January, theovertly pro-Israelifirm\u2019s board of directors gathered in Tel Aviv for its first meeting of the new year. Since then, its financial fortunes have improved dramatically. Throughout May, Palantir\u2019s stockexploded, making it the S&P 500\u2019s top-performing company. On June 2, Palantir\u2019s share price hit anall-time high, a year-on-year jump of 512 percent, turbocharging the company\u2019s market value to roughly $311 billion. Driving this abrupt burst of investor exuberance was a series of lucrative deals signed with multiple U.S. government agencies since Donald Trump took office, and the expectation Palantir will ink massive contracts going forward. Domestic Mass Surveillance & Pentagon Targeting OnMay 30,The New York Timespublished a lengthy probe linking these deals to anexecutive ordersigned by U.S. President Donald Trump in March, calling for seamless, mass sharing of data across government agencies through a Palantir application called Foundry. The report did not explain to readers how Palantir emerged as a small startup thanks to sponsorship from the C.I.A.\u2019s venture capital wing,In-Q-Tel, which gifted Peter Thiel\u2019s company $2 millionin 2004.Instead, the paper leaned in to a partisan angle playing on Democratic fears that Trump could abuse a unified database to target political foes. Thiel at the 2022 Converge Tech Summit in Scottsdale, Arizona.(Gage Skidmore, CC BY-SA 2.0) Nonetheless, theTimesprovided valuable insight into Palantir\u2019s penetration of a vast array of U.S. government agencies, by raking in more than $113 million in federal government spending since Trump took office, on top of \u201cadditional funds from existing contracts as well as new contracts with the Department of Homeland Security and the Pentagon.\u201d In late May, the company\u2019s existing contract with the Department of Defense wasbeefed upby $795 million, bringing it to an eye-popping total award of $1.3 billion. Palantir currently provides the Pentagon with AI targeting software known asMaven, which it uses in battlefields from Syria to Yemen to Ukraine and beyond. The contract will last until at least May 2029. The Trump administration\u2019s fondness for Palantir has placed its data analytics and storage toolFoundryin at least four federal agencies, including the DHS and Health and Human Services Department. Talks are also apparently ongoing with the Social Security Administration and Internal Revenue Service to adopt the resource. This would facilitate merging all these agencies\u2019 datasets. PleaseDonatetothe SpringFundDrive! According to theTimes, Palantir was selected to deliver on Trump\u2019s order to enhance intradepartmental data sharing by Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency. At least three DOGE members previously worked at the company, while two others have worked at Thiel-funded firms. The outlet cited leaked screenshots indicating DHS officials exchanged emails with DOGE in February about merging citizen records, while quoting nameless Palantir employees worrying \u201cabout collecting so much sensitive information in one place,\u201d particularly given the allegedly \u201csloppy\u201d approach to security of \u201csome DOGE employees.\u201d Musk with Trump on May 30 at a departure ceremony for the DOGE adviser in the Oval Office.(White House/Molly Riley) While focusing heavily on the risks posed by Trump\u2019s embrace of Palantir technology, theTimesacknowledged in passing the company \u201chas long worked\u201d with different branches of the U.S. federal government, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In February 2022, Palantir was enlisted by the Biden administration to manage Covid vaccine distribution. Meanwhile, in April, Immigration and Customs Enforcement\u2019s \u201cremoval operations team\u201dgave Palantir$30 million \u201cto build a platform to track migrant movements in real time.\u201d Karp, for his part, has infuriated Trump\u2019s base by boasting during aninterview in Davos, Switzerland, in 2023 that he \u201csinglehandedly stopped the rise of the far-right in Europe\u201d through an application called PG. The following February, heclaimedbefore an audience at the Future Investment Initiative Institute that by supposedly stopping \u201cinnumerable terror attacks\u201d across Europe, Palantir prevented the resurgence of fascism. \u201cI love when I\u2019m getting yelled at in cities in Europe,\u201d Karp declared. \u201cKeep yelling at me\u2026 the only reason why someone\u2019s not goose-stepping between me and you is my product,\u201d he laughed. CIA agent and head of Palantir Alex Karp says his company\u2019s software \u201csingle-handedly\u201d stopped the \u201cfar right\u201d in Europe.

It has created a predictive analytical tool dubbed Mosaic for the purpose, used by the International Atomic Energy Agency and U.S. officials to visualize ties among the people, places and material involved in the Islamic Republic\u2019s nuclear activities. Data harvested and pored over by the resource includes potentially tainted material supposedly stolen from Tehran by Mossad. Such work mimics the services Palantir has provided for U.S.government agenciessuch as the C.I.A., DHS, F.B.I. and Pentagon. These entities routinely turn over untold quantities of data to the firm to exploit for a variety of applications. For example, Palantir\u2019sGothamtool has been weaponized by the U.S. military to supposedly predict insurgent attacks.In Afghanistan, it combined maps, intelligence briefings and incident reports for mission planning, leadingBloomberg to dubPalantir the \u201csecret weapon\u201d of the so-called war on terror. Meanwhile,documents leakedby National Security Agency whistleblower Edward Snowden indicate the U.S. signals intelligence giant and its British counterpart GCHQ have relied heavily on Palantir\u2019s products. A leaked 2011 presentation connected the company\u2019s wares to multiple secret Five Eyes spying operations, and provided glowing personal testimonials from the agencies\u2019 analysts. One crowed: \u201c[Palantir] is the best tool I have ever worked with. It\u2019s intuitive, i.e. idiot-proof, and can do a lot you never even dreamt of doing.\u201d Local law enforcement agencies are also making use of Gotham. The total number of forces worldwide using the technology is unknown, but leaked Los Angeles Police Department training documents on Gotham, including an \u201cIntermediate Course\u201d and an \u201cAdvance Course,\u201d shed significant light on the tool\u2019s internal workings. The sheer volume of data collected on citizens \u2014 whether they are law-abiding, are suspected of having committed a crime, or are simply connected to individuals accused of wrongdoing \u2014 is staggering. This includes sex, race, names, contact details, addresses, prior warrants, mugshots, surveillance photos, personal relationships, past and current employers, tattoos, scars, piercings and other identifying features. Such a cutting-edge service doesn\u2019t come cheap, and Gotham subscriptions run to millions of dollars annually. The vast windfall reaped from multiple state entities since Palantir\u2019s inception has made the firm\u2019s founders very wealthy indeed \u2014Karp\u2019s personal worth alone iscurrently estimatedat $12.2 billion \u2014 and allowed the company to go public inSeptember 2020. On top of the privacy concerns raised by asecretivecompany with access to so much private data, thepractical efficacyof Palantir\u2019s technology has also come under scrutiny since its Foundry applicationwas implantedin Britain\u2019s National Health Service (NHS) in December 2020. That\u2019s when Palantir was awarded a legally dubious no-bid contract to run the Service\u2019s Covid-19 Data Store for two years despitewarningsthat the company could preside over \u201can \u2018unprecedented\u2019 transfer of citizens\u2019 private health information\u201d into its own database. Palantir stand at the NHS Confederation conference 2022.(Rathfelder / Wikimedia Commons / CC BY-SA 4.0) The following year,the NHS awarded Palantir a $447 million contract to build a \u201cFederated Data Platform\u201d combining the medical records of all British citizens. Next, the British government paid millions to a consultancy firm called KPMGto marketPalantir\u2019s platform to local NHS Trusts, which oversee the administration of individual hospitals throughout the country. Since then, several senior medical officialshave warnedthat Palantir\u2019s technology was inferior to current systems, and could actually hinder NHS work. Yet British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has continued his government\u2019s cooperation with Palantir, even visiting the company\u2019s offices in downtown Washington, D.C., immediately after meeting with Trump this February. Louis Mosley, the head of Palantir UK,cheered Starmer\u2019s attitudeafter the visit: \u201cYou could see in his eyes that he gets it. The ambition is there \u2014 the will is there.\u201d Palantir\u2019s Mosley happens to be thegrandsonof Sir Oswald Mosley, the World War II-era Nazi sympathizer who led the British Union of Fascists. Keir Starmer made a special trip to Palantir while he was visiting the US at the end of February & apparently \u201centhused about how Britain wouldn\u2019t over-regulate AI, instead seizing its opportunities in pursuit of \u2018a new economic deal\u2019 with advanced technology at its core.\u201dpic.twitter.com/piC0vdL76b \u2014 12 Ball (@BoltzmannBooty)March 21, 2025 While Thiel\u2019s personal affinity for Trump and closerelationshipswith key members of the president\u2019s cabinet may have eased Palantir\u2019s entry into sensitive government areas, the company\u2019s current trajectory has been years in the making. Having penetrated the national security state of countries across the West, the firm and its messianic CEO are working to consolidate a trans-Atlantic network of control with unprecedented powers, lucrative profits, and a growing body count.

One thing\u2019s for sure \u2013 they are afraid of the masses. Robert E. Williamson Jr.June 9, 2025 at 19:23I\u2019m with You Drew, global society is making a big mistake by not clamping down on A I.The last time the civilization on earth encountered a similar threat was the discover of the atom bomb.Now the wealthiest will be only those who have unlimited funds. I\u2019m with You Drew, global society is making a big mistake by not clamping down on A I. The last time the civilization on earth encountered a similar threat was the discover of the atom bomb. Now the wealthiest will be only those who have unlimited funds. The Zionist threat to the First Amendment is one of the biggest domestic dangers we\u2019re facing today. Palantir and the ADL ultimately want to set up a grand database that\u2019ll identify and monitor everyone who\u2019s deemed anti-Israel or pro Palestinian. They\u2019ll eventually debank us and could possibly even charge us criminally on trumped up charges. The fact that regular folks are slowly becoming enlightened to just how much influence the pro Israel power bloc has in Washington is terrifying to these people. They\u2019re hysterical bc their narrative is failing. I don\u2019t think many people quite understand the power and facility of Palantir/A.I. and how these tech tools will soon be able to narrow everybody down into specific silos of: apolitical moron, pro Israel, anti-Israel\u2026 Thiel and Karp are Mossad connected entrepreneurs who should be shunned by all working American citizens. They first utilized their \u201ctalents\u201d in assisting the Israeli Defense (sic) Forces in targeting and killing thousands of innocent Palestinians in Gaza.
