Ben Robinson|Color Green Photos COLUMBUS \u2014 It would be hard for Covington senior Preston King to have found a better way to end his high school career in the high jump. At the D-III state track and field meet at Jesse Owens Stadium on the campus of The Ohio State University, King soared to new heights, breaking the school record again with a height of 6-8 and finishing third in his final high school meet. \u201cIt was a great way to end things,\u201d King said. \u201cIt felt really good. I am really happy the way it turned out.\u201d After clearing 6-0 and 6-2 on his first attempts, King had a scary moment at 6-4. After missing on his first two attempts at 6-4, he was down to his last attempt. He brushed the bar, but it stayed up. \u201cIt was kind of demoralizing really,\u201d King said. \u201cThat is a height had been making easily and it came down to my third attempt. But, I just had to find a way to push forward. Even though my legs weren\u2019t feeling great, I hadn\u2019t done what I wanted to do. I wanted to do more.\u201d While it put him behind Nolan Garrabant of Fisher Catholic, Jesse Brown of Purcell Marian and Calvin Willow of Arlington on misses, King was just getting started. He cleared 6-5 on his second attempt and 6-6 and 6-7 on his first attempt. When all three failed to clear 6-7, that moved King into the top three. While he had never cleared 6-8 before, he got it on his first attempt, before missing all three attempts at 6-9. Drew Boggs of Delphos St. John\u2019s cleared 6-10 to win and Thomas Cook of Miami Valley School \u2014 who passed at 6-9 \u2014 also cleared 6-8 and took second on misses. \u201cI just had a feeling I could get 6-8,\u201d King said. \u201cI had been close before and I really wanted to get it. It was a great way to end things.\u201d King\u2019s teammate Day\u2019Lynn Garrett advanced to the finals in the 110 meter high hurdles, with the third fastest qualifying time in 14.87, Garrett also finished 15th in the long jump, leaping 19-11. Newton\u2019s Seth Coker advanced to the finals, with the sixth fastest qualifying time in the 400, 49.78. Two Newton relays failed to make the finals. The 400 relay (Jaemyn Lowry, Luke Cornett, Dakota Craig, Christian Maxwell) had the 11th fastest time, 44.11 and the 1,600 relay (Jacson Cress, Liam Woods, Lincoln Smith, Coker) had the 16th fastest time, 3:32.21. DIVISION I Tippecanoe\u2019s Will Strong advanced to the finals in both the 100 and 200 meter dashes. Strong had the seventh fastest qualifying time in both events with a 10.57 100 and 21.48 200. Troy\u2019s Michael Tucker did not make the finals in the 110 high hurdles. He had the 15th fastest time of 14.56.
