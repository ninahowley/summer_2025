Gavin NewsomHe Failed To Step In, So Trump Had To!!!Says Conservative pundit** Exclusive 491 Conservative commentatorMichael Knowlestore into Gov.Gavin Newsomon \"TMZ Live\" -- ripping his response to the L.A. ICE protests and claiming it was such a mess,Trumphad no choice but to step in. Knowles pointed to torched cop cars, assaulted officers, and even an 'illegal alien' allegedly tossing a Molotov cocktail as proof L.A. was in serious trouble -- blaming the chaos on Newsom and MayorKaren Bass' failure to act accordingly, which forced Trump to bring in the National Guard and send in the Marines. When our hosts pushed back -- noting the chaos was limited to one small area -- Knowles doubled down, saying Trump\u2019s actually showing restraint in the matter... and this kind of tough crackdown is exactly what voters are begging for. You gotta watch the full convo -- it gets seriously heated. Knowles even dives into whether he\u2019d back a Dem president doing the same in a red state ... and you're gonna want to hear his take on that!
