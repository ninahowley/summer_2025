Editor\u2019s Choice VPNs **An hour on X reveals a platform riddled with spammers and misfiring algorithms** These days we don\u2019t use X (Twitter) too much because of the high volume of spammers. Of course we copy and paste most of our articles to the platform so our comparatively smaller number of followers can see them, but usually that\u2019s about it. But we do from time to time check in for an hour or so to see how the platform is faring and to see if they\u2019ve made much progress. And today was one of those days. Well, oh dear. Logging in and the first thing we noticed is some bizarre trending hashtags in the \u201cWhat\u2019s Happening\u201d section that is supposed to keep up with trending topics. The hashtag \u201c#TT_WhatsApp_\u041e\u041e966\u041e54\u041e6288\u04174\u201d was featured, which seems an odd \u201ctopic\u201d, and needless to say, when clicking on it to see what posts were using this hashtag, is soon became clear that it was being used almost exclusively by spammers to get engagement for their posts which were largely a mixture of random videos and poorly curated memes. There was no obvious reason why \u201c#TT_WhatsApp_\u041e\u041e966\u041e54\u041e6288\u04174\u201d was specifically trending (for the better part of a day). It\u2019s worth mentioning that the \u201cWhat\u2019s Happening\u201d section (previously calledTrendingorExplore) used to be curated by humans, but this was replaced by AI during Elon Musk\u2019s reign as X boss. Sponsored Content. Continued below\u2026 Also trending this hour was the #RefugeesWelcome hashtag, which seems like a far more normal topic that you\u2019d expect to see on social media. Until, that is, you clicked on it. When clicking on a trending hashtag topic, you\u2019re taken to the \u201ctop\u201d tweets (xeets?) centred around that topic, which is the tweets that X\u2019s algorithms have deemed both popular and relevant enough to appear as \u201ctop tweets\u201d. However in this case, out of the top 10 \u201ctop\u201d tweets, 6 were pornographic images and another showing a graphic injury. None related to the hashtag. Finally, in the hour we spent on X, take a look at the comments on our post highlighting the problem. Overrun by \u201caccount recovery\u201d spammers. (More information on these scams inour post here.) All of these issues we experienced in only a handful of minutes using the platform, and are a reflection on how other users are reporting finding X. It\u2019s all indicative of a platform that is increasingly overrun by spammers that are exploiting the algorithms that are becoming gradually worse at detecting and promoting good content in lieu of spam content. A platform that has become overly reliant on automation and has progressively balked at human moderation (a potential consequence on Muskcutting the X workforce by up to 80%). With reports suggesting the valuation of X is still at least 70% lower since Musk\u2019s takeover, it will be interesting to see if this decline in moderation will have an adverse effect on actual engagement and active user figures.
