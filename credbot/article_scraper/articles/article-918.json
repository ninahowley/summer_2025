Such was the case last Saturday, May 24, in Winnipeg, when a sizable crowd of us gathered tocelebrate the life of Jim Stinson,a passionate outdoorsman, retired Royal Canadian Mounted Police officer and good friend to all who knew him. ADVERTISEMENT Jim died March 2 after a three-year battle with multiple myeloma, a form of blood cancer. He was 76 years old. Through pure coincidence I won\u2019t go into here, I was fortunate to spend many a day in the boat with Jim after we first met in June 2003. There were lots of memories over those 20-plus years. I hadn\u2019t planned to write about this particular encounter, but through the urging of some at last weekend\u2019s celebration of life, I\u2019ll share one of those memories. It occurred last June, when Jim and I made a trip to visit friends who have a cabin on Lake of the Prairies in western Manitoba. Formed by a dam on the Assiniboine River,Lake of the Prairies is an absolutely marvelous walleye fishery,and the fishing we enjoyed last year was no exception. A bit of a hiccup \u2013 for lack of a better word \u2013 occurred on the second evening of our visit when it was discovered the cabin\u2019s septic tank was full and would have to be pumped out, which wouldn\u2019t occur until the next day. Until then, the indoor plumbing would have to be used sparingly. ADVERTISEMENT Before I proceed any further, it should be noted here that Jim was extremely hard of hearing, the result of too much time at the shooting range without ear protection during his time as an RCMP officer. Without his \u201cears in,\u201d Jim was nearly deaf. A nasty thunderstorm rolled through in the wee hours that night, and Jim and I were in separate bedrooms in the lower level of the cabin. During the height of the thunderstorm, nature\u2019s inevitable call required my attention. So, instead of using the cabin\u2019s precarious indoor plumbing, I opted to step out on the patio for what I expected would be a quick trip. When I turned around to head back inside, I discovered the door had locked behind me. So there I was, in T-shirt and skivvies, as the rain poured and the lightning flashed. \u201cSomeday, you\u2019re going to look back on this and laugh,\u201d I thought to myself. ADVERTISEMENT \u201cThis,\u201d however, was not one of those times. Given the predicament facing me at that particular moment, my only option was to head for the shelter of an adjacent shower house that had been built the previous summer. Measuring maybe 6x6 feet square, the shower house wasn\u2019t exactly spacious, but at least it would give me protection from the elements. \u201cThis is going to be a very long night, I thought to myself,\u201d as I tried to curl up on the bench of the shower house. It would be several hours before anyone was awake. About that time, I noticed the light come on in Jim\u2019s bedroom window, which was clearly visible from my vantage point in the shower house. His reason for rising was likely the same as mine, but he\u2019d opted to avoid going outside into a heavy thunderstorm. Good choice, it turns out. Thinking my rescue was imminent, I stepped back outside into the pouring rain, climbed a small ladder that stood nearby and proceeded to knock on Jim\u2019s bedroom window. Jim, who was looking the other direction, didn\u2019t have his hearing aids in and couldn\u2019t hear my efforts to get his attention. All things considered, that\u2019s probably just as well because I\u2019m sure I would have been quite a sight, standing on a ladder in the pouring rain looking in through his window. ADVERTISEMENT \u201cThis can\u2019t be happening,\u201d I thought to myself. Fortunately, one of our hosts heard the commotion from their upstairs bedroom and came down to see what was going on; I was soon back inside. Jim, through it all, was completely oblivious. All\u2019s well that ends well, as the old saying goes, and by early afternoon, the septic tank was pumped out. The storm had passed and, I\u2019m glad to say, the humor of my earlier predicament wasn\u2019t lost on me. Later that afternoon, I was standing on the upstairs deck looking at the woods below \u2013 and the lake beyond that \u2013 when a black bear sauntered by the lower-level patio where I\u2019d been stuck outside in the rain just hours earlier. Uffda. Last weekend, while celebrating Jim\u2019s life, we all had a chuckle about my little misadventure; it was a moment of laughter amid the resounding loss. ADVERTISEMENT Next time, I joked, I\u2019ll make sure the door isn\u2019t locked.
