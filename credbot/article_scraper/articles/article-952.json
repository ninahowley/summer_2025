After falling short in last year's semifinal and earning the No. 2 seed in the 2025 WIAA Division 1 state tournament, the team is playing with a chip on its shoulder. \u201cEspecially the loss last year adds to the idea that they want to get back to win it all,\u201d head coach Tim Roehrig said. \u201cThe two seed, as they put it, just shows people don\u2019t believe in us. I said there\u2019s only one way to change that, and that\u2019s make people believe. So I think that fire is there.\u201d This year\u2019s roster is built around a veteran senior class that brings chemistry and confidence. Senior pitcher Karly Meredith said that bond is what gives the Ghosts an edge. \u201cWe\u2019re so close with each other,\u201d Meredith said. \u201cThey do so well with the youth program so growing up I played with these girls so much. We have such a good connection. So I think just having that relationship really helps this program. There\u2019s a lot of seniors on this team this year, so I think that makes it even more special for all of us to go out on a positive note and end it winning.\u201d Meredith, who is committed to play softball at the University of Virginia, has anchored the team\u2019s success from the circle. She\u2019s a three-time Gatorade Player of the Year and a four-time conference player of the year. \u201cI always say it\u2019s squirrel doing squirrel things, and we\u2019ve always taken it for granted that Karly is going to go out and throw this unbelievable game,\u201d Roehrig said. \u201cI don't know if we're ever going to be able to replace Karly Meredith. That\u2019s just who she is.\u201d But Meredith isn\u2019t the team\u2019s only weapon. Kaukauna has talent and depth across the field. \u201cWe have a lot of talent, whether that\u2019s hitting, defensively, Karly pitching\u2014anything,\u201d senior second baseman Chloe Herzfeldt said. \u201cWe have what it takes. Our outfield, those big plays\u2014we\u2019re always ready for that. We\u2019re willing to give everything we have behind Karly\u2019s back to keep this team all the way to the end.\u201d This senior group is no stranger to the state tournament. They already won state titles as freshmen and sophomores, and they\u2019re hoping to close their careers with one more. \u201cThey\u2019ve been there. They\u2019ve done that,\u201d Roehrig said. \u201cNow they want to finish it off right. So I think there\u2019s that extra drive to say, we\u2019re walking off as champions.\u201d \u201cWe all just have that want, that aggressiveness, that we\u2019re just gonna go out there and leave it all out there,\" Meredith added. Kaukauna enters the quarterfinals as the only undefeated team remaining in Division 1. The Ghosts will face Sun Prairie East at 11 a.m. Wednesday at Goodman Diamond in Madison. **Sign up for theBreaking News Newsletterand receive up to date information.** **now signed up to receive theBreaking News Newsletter.** **Learn More About Sports Reporter John Miller** **Learn More About Sports Reporter John Miller** **Learn More About Sports Reporter Kelly Hallinan** **Learn More About Sports Reporter Kelly Hallinan** News Weather Sports Contact Us WACY Contact Us Don't Waste Your Money Support Sitemap Do Not Sell My Info Privacy Policy Privacy Center Journalism Ethics Guidelines Terms of Use EEO Careers WGBA FCC Public File WGBA Public File Contact Us WACY FCC Public File WACY Public File Contact Us WLWK FCC Public File WLWK Public File Contact Us FCC Application Accessibility Statement Scripps Media Trust Center Closed Captioning Contact NBC26GreenBay nbc26"}
