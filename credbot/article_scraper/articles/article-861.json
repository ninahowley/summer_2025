and Jennifer Nettles: \u201cIt can be tricky for a musician to play a musician on screen\u201d** Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email **Kevin Bacon and Jennifer Nettles on Appalachian Horror, Back-from-the-Dead Love Songs, The Bondsman, and The Righteous Gemstones** If you\u2019ve ever wondered what would happen ifJustified,The Exorcist, andNashvillewalked into a bar and started a band,The Bondsmanis your answer. Kevin Bacon plays Hub Halloran, a dead bounty hunter who crawls back from the grave with a grudge, a guitar, and a haunted past. Jennifer Nettles\u2014yes, of Sugarland and Righteous Gemstones fame\u2014plays Maryanne, his ex-wife and possibly future musical partner. And yes, they made a whole damn album as their characters. It\u2019s calledTo Hell And Backand it\u2019s somehow both fictional and totally not. \u201cI went into it blind,\u201d Bacon says. \u201cDidn\u2019t even know where the season was going. No director, no cast. I just read the pilot and told Jason Blum, \u2018I\u2019m in.\u2019\u201d Because that\u2019s what you do when Jason Blum texts you. It\u2019s called job security. For Nettles, who\u2019s been politely declining every \u201ccan you just play a singer in this?\u201d role for a decade, this one finally made the cut. \u201cI was like, it\u2019s gonna take somethingreallyspecial,\u201d she says. \u201cBecause if I do it well, they\u2019ll say \u2018she\u2019s just playing herself,\u2019 and if I do it poorly, they\u2019ll say, \u2018wow, she can\u2019t even fake being a musician.\u2019\u201d So, a real win-win. Turns out, the magic wasn\u2019t just in the script. Bacon and Nettles wrote the songs themselves\u2014as their characters. That\u2019s not method acting, that\u2019s next-level fanfic with a recording budget. \u201cThe first song we wrote was \u2018To Hell And Back,\u2019\u201d says Bacon, \u201cand Jen sent me this verse and I was like, \u2018Alright, this one\u2019s done.\u2019\u201d It helps that Nettles casually drops lines like\u201cI ain\u2019t Johnny / you ain\u2019t June / but I\u2019d go to hell and back for you.\u201dMeanwhile, most of us are out here rhyming \u201cmoney\u201d with \u201choney\u201d like it\u2019s still 1957. \u201cKevin is a fantastic songwriter,\u201d Nettles says, clearly meaning it, which you can tell because she doesn\u2019t say \u201cfor an actor.\u201d And he returns the favor: \u201cWe didn\u2019t cast her because she could sing\u2014we cast her because she was the right person. That she can sing and write is just\u2026 perfect.\u201d They wrote the songs from their characters\u2019 perspectives. \u201cIt was like going back and asking, \u2018Who was Hub when he was 25?\u2019\u201d Bacon says. \u201cAs an actor, you think about backstory. But I\u2019d never written one into a song before.\u201d Some of those songs made it intoThe Bondsman. Others got the boot. \u201cMultiple songs got rejected,\u201d Bacon says. \u201cWhich, to me, is a good thing. It means we weren\u2019t just cramming them in because the star wanted a moment.\u201d Those left behind found a second life onTo Hell And Back, which is kind of poetic for a show about resurrection. \u201cIt\u2019s born from this world,\u201d Nettles says, \u201cbut it can live outside of it.\u201d In other words, you don\u2019t need to watch the show to dig the record\u2014but if you do, it all hits deeper. The music leans Appalachian and Irish, sometimes hymnal, often haunted. \u201cIt\u2019s got a lot of minor Irish folk DNA,\u201d Nettles says, name-checking \u201cWoe Death\u201d and their harmonies on \u201cWill the Circle Be Unbroken\u201d as high points. You know, just your typical demons-and-dustbowl-folk bangers. There are whispers of a live show\u2014Bacon popped up with Sugarland in Austin for a one-off\u2014and if the crowd size was any indicator, people are more than ready to go toHell And Backwith them. Your move, Ryman Auditorium. And for the record, Bacon\u2019s Southern drawl in the show is surprisingly convincing. \u201cI was lucky,\u201d he says. \u201cJen and Beth Grant were in my ear, and we shot in Georgia. All I had to do was get in the van and listen.\u201d It\u2019s not every day a TV show gives you plot, pathos, and a playable record\u2014call it prestige television with a B-side.
