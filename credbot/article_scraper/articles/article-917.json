University of South Florida senior Jessica Michelle Singleton confidently stepped onto the stage of Side Splitters comedy club in Tampa, Fla., in 2008 ready to perform her new set. A week prior, she had the crowd busting their guts, advancing her to the semifinals of the club\u2019s open-mic comedy competition. The business\u2019 manager B.T. advised her to clean up her set a little by not dropping as many F-bombs. She prepared new material completely void of curse words that included a music cue. She overcorrected. When she told her first few jokes, instead of being filled with uproarious laughter, the room was quiet\u2014the faint sound of someone slurping their drink breaking the silence. Singleton began to sweat, panic evident on her face. She pushed through her set, speeding up the pacing of her joke-telling when her material continued to land flat with the audience. The amateur comedian reached the music cue within the set, reciting the lead-up into it just like she had written it at home. \u201cThis one has to work,\u201d she anxiously thought. But the DJ didn\u2019t play the song, messing up the punchline. In the end, Singleton exited the stage to stilted applause and headed over to her friends, who greeted her with open arms. They left for a bar afterward to soothe the pain when a man recognized the Mississippi native from Side Splitters. \u201cYou do comedy right?\u201d he asked her. \u201cI\u2019m trying to start doing it,\u201d she responded. \u201cI just want you to know that I saw you last week, and it was really great,\u201d he started. Internally, Jessica breathed a sigh of relief, happy that someone had seen her at her greatest. The moment of reassurance renewed her hopes that she could actually have a career in comedy despite her bad set that night. A second later, however, the man bursted her bubble with his next words. \u201cI saw you tonight, and I don\u2019t know what happened up there, but keep on keeping on,\u201d he said, trying to be encouraging. To say she was embarrassed would have been an understatement; Singleton could have died right there on the spot. Seventeen years later, though, she can laugh heartily at how bad that week\u2019s set had been, understanding that she had learned a lesson: Sometimes, you have to bomb early in your career so that you know you can get through it, she explained. \u201cThe set I wrote, I think I just blocked it outta my memory because of the trauma. To be honest, I don\u2019t have the slightest clue of what song it was. It was terrible,\u201d Singleton told the Mississippi Free Press. \u201c\u2026 If you\u2019re doing really well too much upfront and then you go do a big showcase and bomb, I think that could really just kill a person.\u201d Get exclusive stories that look at context and solutions to systemic issues for Mississippi and the nation with these FREE daily newsletters. Still, the woman who had dreams of someday appearing on Saturday Night Live persevered, the laughs she earned the first time she attended an open mic during her final semester in college solidifying her desire to pursue the field. \u201cFrom the first laugh I got, I had this instant feeling of like, \u2018Oh, this is what I wanna do. This is what I think I\u2019m supposed to do,\u201d she said. **\u2018I Wanna Do This\u2019** Jessica Singleton\u2019s family moved to Ocean Springs when she was 3 years old because her dad was stationed at the Keesler Air Force Base in Biloxi. She attended Magnolia Park Elementary School, made great friends, and basked in the nice weather and good food. \u201cI grew up in a household that was pretty funny, but my mom used to watch so much stand-up comedy when I was a kid. George Carlin. We watched all the good nineties sitcoms like \u2018Martin,\u2019 \u2018Living Single,\u2019 \u2018In Living Color,\u2019 \u2018SNL.\u2019 Eddie Murphy\u2019s specials, which I probably shouldn\u2019t have watched as young as I did,\u201d she said. When she entered sixth grade, the family moved to Anchorage, Alaska, which was a hard transition for Singleton. She had a difficult time making friends, as classmates would make fun of her accent and otherwise pick on her. \u201cI would get bullied by boys, and they would make fun of me, and I would just keep to myself and be like, \u2018Keep your head down; like, don\u2019t cause a scene,\u2019\u201d she recalled. Her home life wasn\u2019t faring that much better. Her mother and father were both struggling with addiction issues, drugs and alcohol, respectively, so Singleton leaned on comedy as a coping mechanism\u2014doing funny things and cracking jokes to break up the tension of her parents\u2019 arguing. Comedy ultimately became her super weapon against her bullies as well. \u201cThere was just one guy who constantly picked on me, and one day I just snapped back at him with a comeback,\u201d she recalled. \u201cWhatever I said was very funny, and all of his friends started laughing. And then it became this slow thing where everyone just started becoming my friend because they were like, \u2018She\u2019s better at making fun of us.\u2019\u201d After that, Singleton became more comfortable with being herself, and she started speaking out and showcasing her personality more often. She made friends, joined clubs, and hosted talent shows and events where her comedy could really shine. \u201cEven though I still went to college (for other disciplines), by my senior year I was like, \u2018Well I\u2019m gonna do comedy.\u2019 I didn\u2019t know what it looked like, but I was like I wanna do this,\u201d she said. Singleton graduated from the University of South Florida in 2008 with degrees in public relations and marketing. She dabbled in the Tampa comedy scene while working three jobs to save up enough money to eventually move to Los Angeles, Calif. **\u2018On the Right Path\u2019** When Singleton first moved to Los Angeles, she got a job working at a nonprofit doing public relations, fundraising and event coordination. She would work her day job from 7:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. and then go to open mics afterward, driving across the city to perform at as many locations as she could. \u201cI\u2019d go to like three or four open mics at night trying material and getting it as strong as I could, and then I would hang out at The Comedy Store on Sunset until they closed,\u201d she explained. \u201cI was just soaking it up for about three years \u2019til I left my full-time job. Because I was so immersed in the scene, people saw me places, they got to know me, and I would do my material.\u201d Eventually, she honed her material enough to do a set atThe Comedy Store, a 53-year-old American comedy club in West Hollywood, where she impressed comedian Bobby Lee, who was in attendance that night. He came up to her after her set, hailing her talent and encouraging her to keep going. Months later, he asked her to open for his comedy show. \u201cIt was this spiral of bigger comics starting to ask me to open for them,\u201d she said. \u201cI started submitting tapes to comedy festivals all over the country. In 2013, I got into like 15 festivals. That was the year I left my full-time job. By the end of the year, there was this big European festival that never had English-speaking comedy. It was the coolest experience in my life. I think that was the moment I was like, \u2018I think I\u2019m on the right path.\u2019\u201d A few years later, she became a regular at The Comedy Store and released some comedy albums that went number one. Now, she is gearing up to release her new comedy special \u201cHi Y\u2019all\u201d on April 29, 2025, onPunchUpand later to YouTube and other platforms. She filmed the special in New Orleans in October 2024, wanting to feel closer to the South. \u201c There\u2019s like a big chunk of jokes about growing up in Mississippi and then jokes about my childhood, which aren\u2019t necessarily like a hundred percent pertinent to being in the South. But I was like, \u2018I wanna go back close to where I\u2019m from,\u2019 and I love New Orleans,\u201d she said. Some of Singleton\u2019s comedy is rooted in her childhood trauma, including her experiences in having to deal with parents struggling with addictions. One of the jokes in her special revolves around her dad leaving her at a Waffle House when she was 8, and another touches on the many jobs he had, which she said spoke more to his inability to keep a job. \u201cHe was addicted to meth, and I make a joke about it in the special where I go \u2018I didn\u2019t know. Nobody knew \u2019cause he was fat. And it\u2019s like, \u2018Come on man. How are you fat and a meth head? Like pick an addiction dude,\u2019\u201d Singleton joked. \u201cThat was a thing I didn\u2019t talk about for years and even until a few years into stand-up,\u201d the comedian said. \u201cI was like, \u2018I\u2019m gonna try to make this funny.\u2019 I think some of it was not wanting to remember at all. I think being able to find ways to make it funny now as an adult is also healing.\u201d Following the release of her special, Jessica is hoping to tour and to expose her comedy to more audiences. She has also been auditioning for some acting roles, though her first priority will always be comedy. \u201cAt the end of the day, stand-up is what I love, and it\u2019s really meant to be seen live. So, if I could encourage one thing, it\u2019s to go see a live show,\u201d Singleton said. \u201c A live stand-up show is such a unique and fun experience where you feel just connected to a whole crowd of people around you through your laughter. My goal is to be able to do that at a bigger level.\u201d Jessica Michelle Singleton\u2019s new comedy special \u201cHi Y\u2019all\u201d will premiere on April 29, 2025 at 7 p.m. Central Time on PunchUp.
