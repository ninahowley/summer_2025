Fitchen-Young finished in 4 minutes, 10.39 seconds, which bettered his 4:15.84 school record in the distance, set as a junior at the 2024 Nike Outdoor Nationals. \u201cHad a really fun time up here in Seattle, just soaking all the little moments in,\u201d Fitchen-Young said. \u201cBrooks truly put on a special event and so grateful that I got to be a part of it. \u2026 The race itself was alright, not bad but not good. Again just super thankful to be here, but definitely wanted to run a little faster. 4:10 for the mile is around 3.5 seconds off my 1,600-meter PR so it wasn\u2019t too bad, but I\u2019m definitely more fit that I showed today.\u201d TJ Hansen, a University of Colorado commit out of Freeland High in Freeland, Michigan, finished in 4:01.23 to beat runner-up Corbin Coombs (4:03.72), a three-event state champion this spring for Organ Mountain in Las Cruces, New Mexico, to the finish line. Coombs, a Wake Forest commit won titles in the 800, 1,600 and 3,200 at the state championships, entered as the No. 1 seed. He and Hansen entered as sub-4-minute milers. Vinay Raman, a University of Pennsylvania commit out of Hershey High in Pennsylvania, took third with a PR of 4:05.85. Hansen had a 2025 Champion flag draped over his shoulders when he sat in a purple and gold throne atop the podium, where he was flanked by Coombs and Raman. Caleb Ten Pas, a junior at Des Moines Christian in Urbandale, Iowa, took fourth in 4:08.34. He was followed by Brian Burns (4:09.92), a junior at Bentonville HIgh in Arkansas, Fitchen-Young, Kade Brownell (4:12.37), a Washington State University commit out of Mount Spokane High in Mead, Washington, and Soheib Dissa (4:13.81), a Duke commit out of Newtown High in Sandy Hook, Connecticut. Aiden Monistere, an Iowa State University commit out of Parkview Baptist School in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, took ninth in 4:21.00. Alden Morales, a junior at J Serra Catholic in San Juan Capistrano, took 10th in 4:41.59. **Share this:** Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Facebook Click to share on X (Opens in new
