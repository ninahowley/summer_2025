Thanks for visiting! **Welcome Back!** Welcome Back! Welcome Back! by Ioannesfrobenius,froebelgalleries, \u00a92025 (Jun. 11, 2025) \u2014 When this author approached Victor Akash Rakovitch of Press Gurwitz Perfumerie in the rural Upstate New York village of Marathon (Cortland County), NY, about creating a unisex perfume evoking the Tsarist Russian Empire, he readily agreed. He had received a copy of GRAND DUCHESS ANASTASIA: STILL A MYSTERY? (Histria Books, 2023) (histriabooks.com/product/grand-duchess-anastasia). We evaluated 7 evolving formulas before mutually satisfied with number 7, which was christened \u201cImperial Mystery\u201d (Imperskaya Taina-\u0418\u043c\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0442\u0430\u0439\u043d\u0430). This author encouraged Mr. Rakovich to explain the process, the inspiration, the connections to the world of Tsarist Russia. His explanation follows: \u201cI drew inspiration from techniques and materials that gained prominence at the turn of the century, including the revolutionary use of Coumarin, the first-ever natural isolate in perfumery. Introduced in 1881 withFoug\u00e8re Royale, Coumarin marked the beginning of a new era in perfumery, giving birth to the iconic foug\u00e8re family of fragrances. To honor Nicolas II, I incorporated bright, uplifting citrus notes of bergamot. Rich and leathery undertones, emblematic of the royal court, are represented by vetiver, labdanum, tobacco, benzoin, oakmoss, and black tea, adding depth and sophistication to the composition. A note particularly dear to my heart is black currant, which evokes memories of the motherland and plays a symbolic role in the fragrance. The warm, heart-opening vanilla is also present, complemented by the crisp, fresh notes of pine\u2014a tree that grows abundantly across Russia. Romanov\u2019s historical documents also mention a variety of floral notes. Among them are violet and violet leaf, Anastasia\u2019s favorites, along with the timeless elegance of Rose de Mai, Indian saffron, carnation, and lavender, all of which contribute to the multilayered scent character.\u201d \u0394 \u0394 This site uses Akismet to reduce spam.Learn how your comment data is processed."}
