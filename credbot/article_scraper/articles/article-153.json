guilt\u201d\u2014these solemn words, spoken as a vow, are repeated each time a sister of Perpetual Indulgence dons her veil. Their clicking heels and pancake makeup and profuse glitter masks a deep purpose. \u201cPerpetual indulgence\u201d can mean \u201cendless debauchery.\u201d But within a liturgical or church context, \u201cindulgence\u201d means the forgiveness of sins. The Sisters are an order dedicated to endless forgiveness and compassion\u2014for the guilty and innocent alike. There is much guilt and shame to expiate. Notwithstanding the succession of two \u201cliberal popes,\u201d the modern Catholic church still regards homosexuality and transsexuality as a sins. Sins kindred to fraud, violence, usury and the sexual abuse of children. The world Catholic communion stands at 1.5 billion members. Around the world, many hundreds of millions of LGBTQ + folk are persecuted, prosecuted, shamed and closeted for their love. They are persecuted and closeted here in America. Now with a renewed and emboldened bigotry. The Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence first formed in the 1980s out of spontaneous drag counterprotests to traveling preachers (of all denominations) who had come to preach fire and damnation on the streets of the Castro District\u2014the modern \u201cSodom.\u201d The local River Sisters chapter formed in Guerneville in 2001. I caught co-founder Sister Sparkle Plenty outside one of our local chapters\u2019 locally famous charity Bingo nights. Sisters keep the gaming action hot by layering multi-card Bingo with rounds of scratchers, raffles, random giveaways and sharp-tongued comic crowd work with the many regulars. At each monthly Bingo event, a different local nonprofit or cause-of-the-moment is supported. This month was Boy Scout uniforms. The Sisters\u2019 ministry has expanded from the protection of their community to the support of all vulnerable communities. Such is their abundant love. Cincinnatus Hibbard: Sister Sparkle, could you share with us the full vow that binds your order? Sister Sparkle Plenty: It would be my pleasure \u2026 \u201cI hereby promise, cross my heart and hope to die, that I will forever uphold the love and spirit of The Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence. I will dedicate myself to the promulgation of universal joy and the expiation of stigmatic guilt. I will be considerate of how my words and actions affect others. I will strive diligently to have a sense of humor and to never ever take myself so seriously that I forget to have fun. Amen, a women and everybody else.\u201d It must be beautiful to recite your purpose so beautifully every day. I would invite our readers to do the same. Sister \u2026 I noticed there wasn\u2019t a vow of chastity in that. \u2026 No. (archly) It is suspiciously lacking isn\u2019t it? \u2026 (Laughs)Speaking of the \u201cpromulgation of universal joy,\u201d I understand that you now count over 100 independent chapters all over the world. Some call it global domination. (laughs) We\u2019ve grown quite a bit\u2014especially in the last 10 years. Growth has been surprisingly strong in the South. A lot of guilt and shame to expiate there. And a lot of fun to be had. Although it isn\u2019t in the oath, there is an implied vow of poverty because The Sisters give away every penny that you fundraise\u2014nothing for overhead. 100%. We are all volunteers. \u2026 we are from time to time showered with personal gifts from our many admirers \u2026 which we never refuse, (winks) (Laughs nervously)How much have you raised as an independent chapter? Over $4 million for over 200 local charities and causes. Lordy.
