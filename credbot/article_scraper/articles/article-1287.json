Evan Solomon says Canada will move away from \"over-indexing on warnings and regulation\" to make sure the economy benefits from AI. He says getting AI regulation right is critical to Canada\u2019s \"economic destiny.\" In his first speech since becoming Canada\u2019s first-ever AI minister, Solomon outlined four priorities for his ministry. They include scaling up Canada\u2019s AI industry, driving adoption and ensuring Canadians have trust in and sovereignty over the technology. He says his focus with AI regulation will be on data protection and privacy. This report by The Canadian Press was first published June 10, 2025.
