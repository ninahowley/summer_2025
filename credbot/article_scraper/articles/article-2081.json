After all, gaming accessories are meant for gamers. According to research from Grand View Research, the globalgaming peripheral marketsize was estimated at $5.14 billion in 2022 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 10% from 2023 to 2030. This is due to the rising popularity of many gaming segments, including virtual reality (VR) and esports, fueling the demand for specialized gaming keyboards, gamepads, headphones, and other accessories. While some people may argue that you don\u2019t need gaming accessories to game well or more effectively, most gamers would argue that peripherals specially made for gaming help elevate the experience and immersion depending on the game. Today, gaming peripherals range from gaming mice with high polling rates for faster shots in your favorite FPS to intricate gaming chairs with various moving parts to ensure a tailored and comfortable experience. However, there is also a niche for more unique gaming accessories you may not have heard of. Below, we\u2019ll be sharing four gaming accessories you didn\u2019t know you needed: Table of Contents Gaming glasses Haptic gaming chair Racing wheel and pedals set Eye tracking device **Gaming glasses** Even if you don\u2019t need glasses for vision correction or other eye conditions, investing in a pair of gaming glasses can be good for you and your eyesight. With so many new AAA games coming out every year, it would be a shame not to be able to enjoy the next-generation graphics and features if you can\u2019t see them clearly. Unfortunately, monitors and screens emit harmful blue light, which can cause sleep disruption and eye strain after long periods of exposure. Many gaming companies have since partnered with eyewear brands to make specializedblue light glasses, which are designed to protect your eyes from blue light exposure. Eyewear retailer Eyebuydirect makes blue light glasses that preserve visual comfort by filtering blue-violet light. Models like Algorithm and Vinyl look like regular eyeglasses, which is great if you\u2019re looking for alternatives to more explicit gaming brands to be worn when not gaming. **Haptic gaming chair** A relatively new entry into the gaming peripherals market, haptic gaming accessories can help shape the future of next-generation gaming \u2014 think of the sci-fi gaming movie and book Ready Player One. In a previous post, we highlighted sometech gadgetsmillennial gamers should have, including haptic feedback accessories that can help gamers feel vibrations from the roaring engines of a car or virtual heartbeats in a boss battle. In early 2024, gaming peripheral giant Razer introduced the company\u2019shaptic gaming chairat the CES 2024. The prototype \u201cProject Esther\u201d haptic gaming cushion can make you feel everything in-game \u2014 \u201cfrom explosions to the subtlest heartbeat.\u201d The concept uses audio-to-haptic technology. In a test through a short round of Mortal Kombat: 1, reviewers noted each punch came with an emphasized blow from the system. While most haptic feedback these days comes from console controllers, it\u2019ll be interesting to see the future of gaming. **Racing wheel and pedals set** Even if you aren\u2019t a heavy-duty racing sim gamer, investing in a racing wheel and pedal set can elevate your gaming experience and significantly boost immersion. Of course, this may not be as effective for specific genres like MOBAs or shooters, but if you like driving around Los Santos in Grand Theft Auto V, a racing wheel and pedal set could transform your gaming session. Some gamers also use these gaming pedals as additional inputs for their games, such as a push-to-talk button for online games. Recently, high-end headphones company Turtle Beach entered this gaming peripheral segment by introducing the VelocityOne Raceracing wheeland pedal set. The system features a K-Drive motor that delivers feedback simulating what one might feel if you were really behind the wheel of a racing car speeding around a track. The VelocityOne also features Dynamic Brake Tek, which replicates the feel of braking in an actual car. **Eye tracking device** Finally, another gaming accessory you may not think you need is an eye tracking device. While it\u2019s certainly not as necessary as a mouse and keyboard or controller, an eye tracking device functions as an additional input for in-game actions. Companies like Tobii have developed eye-tracking devices supported by over 170 video game titles that track head and eye movements without a wearable device. These can be used to target in-game enemies or look around in-game like you would with a VR headset. Some gamers have also used eye trackers to help evaluate their recorded gameplay. For example, in first-person shooter games, eye tracking can help gamers improve and assess where they are looking during games. If you\u2019re spending too much time looking at the bottom of the screen instead of the center \u2014 where your crosshair should be \u2014 then you know which area to improve on. Some gamers also use eye trackers to assess how fast their reaction and scanning time is in-game. **Other Games** 4 Gaming Accessories You Didn\u2019t Know You NeedGames2024/054 4 4 Nebulous Fleet Command: Unlock Strategic DominationGames2024/050 0 0 Mastering the Brutal Orchestra: A Conductor\u2019s OdysseyGames2024/050 0 0 Unraveling Mysteries of the Ratty Catty: A Pet Owner\u2019s GuideGames2024/050 0 0 Explore the Thrilling World of Anime City: A Fan\u2019s GuideGames2024/051 1 1 Board Games on Steam \u2013 Discover the Best Multiplayer ExperiencesGames2024/050 0 0 Monster Girl Games \u2013 Explore the Exciting GenreGames2024/050 0 0 Kiwi Clicker: The Ultimate Idle Game ExperienceGames2024/050 0 0 Comprehensive Review of Ports Of Call Deluxe 3D 2024Games2024/050 0 0 Breed Graphorn in Hogwarts Legacy \u2013 Quick GuideGames2024/040 0 0 We are using cookies to give you the best experience on our website.
