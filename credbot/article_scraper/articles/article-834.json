Vardywill leaveLeicester Citywhen his contract at the King Power Stadium expires this summer, having signed off in style with his 200th goal in his 500th appearance. It has been claimed the striker wants to stay in the Premier League, whileGary Lineker says he can see Vardy moving to America to play in the MLS. While he considers his next move, Celtic legend Frank McAvennie has encouraged his former club to swoop for the 38-year-old and reunite him with ex-Leicester boss Brendan Rodgersamid links with a move to their Old Firm rivals Rangers. \u201cVardy. I would take Vardy,\u201dsaid McAvennie. \u201cI know they are talking about him going to Rangers, but I would take Vardy at Celtic. \u201cThey (Danny Ings and Vardy) are goal scorers. Two of them are goal scorers. They are just natural predators. Get them up here. Good names. \u201cThe two of them know where the back of the net is. People keep saying, \u2018you don\u2019t look up\u2019. You don\u2019t have to look up. Goals don\u2019t move. It\u2019s the only thing on the pitch that doesn\u2019t move.\u201d It comes after Rangers legend Ally McCoist previously said he would love to see Vardy at Ibrox. \u201cI would take him in two minutes at Rangers. I really, really would,\u201d he said. \"I'd take him in two minutes.\" **Where do you think Vardy will be playing next season?Tell us HERE** **Get your special Jamie Vardy edition of the Leicester Mercury** It was certainly a fairytale ending to Jamie Vardy's Leicester City career - netting his 200th goal in his final match for the club.
