The newspaper has other stories: Young people today have a hard enough time interacting face-to-face with their peers, let alone handling conflict, according to one administrator at a large Midwestern public university. Students today, he explained, tend to view other people as either hurtful or helpful with very little gray area in between. Negotiating differences and handling conflict, he said, often leads to real anxiety on their part. This mindset is facilitated by online behaviors that enable kids, from an early age, to shut out people they dislike or disapprove of. Columbia University Professor Ioana Literat said college students are reflecting what they see on social media. \u201cStudents are increasingly fluent in digital tools for managing boundaries like blocking, muting, curating their spaces, and no contact orders are sometimes seen as an offline extension of that: a way to formalize emotional or interpersonal boundaries through institutional means,\u201d Literat said. Pro-Palestinian students also reportedly used the orders to keep away pro-Israel and Jewish students, according to the Anti-Defamation League. Other issues are also at play. \u201cMost administrators date the increased use of no contact orders to the past eight to 10 years, the same period in which political polarization, numerous social justice movements, the Covid pandemic and the Israel/Gaza war turned up the heat on many campuses,\u201d the newspaper reported.
