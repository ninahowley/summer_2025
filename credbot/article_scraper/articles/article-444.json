PM Press, 2024 \u201cLeftist terrorism and state terrorism, even if their motivations cannot be compared, are two jaws of the same mug\u2019s game. The state hates terrorism, but prefers it to revolution.\u201d So says Buenaventura Diaz in the 1974 French/Italian co-productionNada, one of the dozens of films profiled inRevolution in 35mm, edited by Andrew Nette and Samm Deighan. Nette is no stranger to sifting through pop cultural detritus to find revolutionary messages. His previous three books for PM Press covered similar topics in pulp novels and the New Wave of science fiction. The two editors contribute most of the pieces within, but there are spaces for other talented writers to shine. The book begins with the oeuvre of Gillo Pontecorvo, most famous for directing 1966\u2019sBattle of Algiers, one of the most iconic films of colonial revolt. In between the longer chapters are shorter outtakes that cover one film or a few films at a time, rather than a genre. Even if one hasn\u2019t seen the films discussed, the editors generously supply over 200 production stills and posters from around the world that give a sense of each film\u2019s visuals and tone. Genre is no object for the films covered. Neither is the often-thin line between the grindhouse and arthouse. Contributors look at films from the somewhat mainstream spaghetti Westerns to the much more obscure Indian gangster movies. Political violence and resistance are a large umbrella that many films can, and do, fit into. The publisher\u2019s description notes that \u201cthe book examines film-making movements like the French, Japanese, German, and Yugoslavian New Waves; sub-genres like spaghetti westerns, Italianpoliziotteschi, Blaxploitation, and mondo movies; and films that reflect the values of specific movements, including feminists, Vietnam War protesters, and Black militants.\u201d At the same time that Hollywood was pushing saccharine films in the mid-1960s like The Sound of Music, outsiders were crafting films that went far beyond even the supposed rebelliousness of the New Hollywood of Coppola and Scorcese. The time frame covered byRevolution in 35mmspans the colonial revolts that put the final nails in classic European imperialism\u2019s coffin to the collapse of the Soviet Union heralding the end of the Cold War. It\u2019s clear from contributor Matthew Kowalski\u2019s discussions of the Yugoslavian New Wave that \u201cactually existing socialism\u201d was just as ripe for counter-cultural films as the capitalist West. Trying to make films under authoritarian regimes is a recurrent theme of the book. Brazilian Directors Glauber Rocha and Jose Mojica Marins dealt with their U.S. backed junta. Lino Brocka struggled to realize his vision under the Marcos dictatorship (also U.S. backed) in the Philippines. Certainly, living in the Communist Bloc allowed for little freedom of artistic expression during the Cold War. For instance, the New Wave in Yugoslavia came under heavy official pressure. Andrzej Zulawski\u2019s surreal horror filmThe Devilwas banned in his native Poland. Nor were the capitalist democracies an easy place to make films. German filmmakers grappled with the legacies of Nazism and the inadequate de-Nazification all the while urban guerrillas like the Red Army Faction (the Baader-Meinhoff Gang) and the Revolutionary Cells waged war against the postwar state. In Italy, the Years of Lead from the late 1960s until the late \u201980s were replayed on movie screens inpoliziotteschi, films that pitted hardboiled cops against the political establishment and right-wing conspirators. \u201cAre you asking us to investigate or to overthrow the government?\u201d asks one beleaguered police superintendent in Sergio Martino\u2019sSuspicious Death of a Minor. The attitude of these films followed the old Latin phrase: \u201cLet justice be done though the heavens fall.\u201d Some of the best essays include focus on one film or a small group of films. Greek-Australian novelist Christos Tsiolkas explores his complicated feelings towardsZ, the 1969 Costa-Gavras anti-Greek junta film which has acquired a reputation of being immune from criticism. Cultural commentator Annie Rose Malement attempts to rehabilitate one of the most despised subgenres in exploitation cinema: the rape/revenge film. Exemplified by the 1978 American production,I Spit On Your Grave, the genre came under attack from both conservative moral guardians and feminist activists. Malement analyzes the films through the lens of Valerie Solanus\u2019sSCUM Manifesto(Society for Cutting Up Men) that argues men have ruined the world, and finds much to recommend in them. Even the shlocky 1974Rape Squad(also listed by the less outrageous title, Act of Vengeance) is praised for referencing Chicago Women Against Rape and Sisters of Color Ending Sexual Assault for its plot featuring a group of rape victims taking bloody direct action against a serial rapist. Writer Robert Skvarla takes an interesting look at another much-maligned genre, Italian mondo films. Essentially over-the-top exploitive documentaries, mondos earned a reputation for racism and colonialism due to films like 1966\u2019sAfrica Addio(Goodbye Africa). That film was picketed by abolitionist and former Black Panther Angela Davis in East Berlin over its alleged racism the year of the film\u2019s release. By contrast, Svarkla views the film as an attack on European colonialism, one that places the blame for the continent\u2019s violence on European exploitation. He makes the case for the \u201980s mondo filmThe Killing of Americaas \u201cone of the most damning indictments of America ever made.\u201d How did contemporary radicals feel about the films profiled in this book? The record is mixed. For one, the Black Panthers thrilled to Melvin van Peebles\u2019sSweet Sweetback\u2019s Badassss Song, recommending the film on the front page of their party\u2019s newspaper. On the other hand, one student radical criticized the filmThe Strawberry Statement, based on the 1968 Columbia University occupation, as \u201ca cheap attempt at the commercial co-option and exploitation of the anguish of a generation.\u201d In their introduction, editors Nette and Deighan argue that films from the fringes are just as worthwhile of critical attention as the blockbusters and critical darlings. Their book gives that attention to many under-seen and under-appreciated films. Revolution in 35mmcovers enough films in its 350 pages for a year\u2019s worth of viewings. It would make for a great alternative to the standard film curriculums with theirCitizen KaneorBirth of a Nation. It challenges a reader of the book to resist making a list, mental or physical, of films they would want to watch. I know I couldn\u2019t.
