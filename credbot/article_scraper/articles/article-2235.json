But despite suffering a pectoral injury and being put on the IR broadcasting list, Michael Strahan was able to recover, tackle George Stephanopoulos during an in-studio cooking segment, and beat Sawyer\u2019s long-standing record of 140 career sacks.\u201d At press time, Strahan had reportedly been traded toCBS Morningsin exchange for CBS all-time pass rusher Gayle King and CBS return specialist/backup wide receiver Nate Burleson.
