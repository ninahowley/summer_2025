The floodway is the portion of the floodplain that includes the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land area that must be reserved in order to discharge the 1% annual chance (base) flood without cumulatively increasing the water-surface elevation by more than a designated height. The FIRM is used to help the community with floodplain management. TNP, Inc. is applying for a Letter of Map Revision (LOMR) from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (DHS-FEMA) on behalf of Royse City Community Development Corporation to revise FIRM 48397C0055L, panel 55 for the City of Royse City, Texas along Pond Branch. Royse City Community Development Corporation is proposing to revise the floodplain based on updated topography. The City of Royse City's Development Services Department, in accordance with National Flood Insurance Program regulation at 44 CFR \u00c2\u00a765.7(b)(1), hereby gives notice of the city's intent to revise the 1-percent-annual-chance floodway, generally located between Erby Campbell Boulevard and South Elm Street. Specifically, the floodway shall be revised from a point downstream of F.M. 548 to a point just downstream of Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad. The LOMR will also result in widening and narrowing of the 1-percent-annual-chance floodplain and both increases and decreases in the 1% annual chance (base) water-surface elevations for a portion of Pond Branch. This letter is to inform you of the proposed revision that may affect flood elevations on your property at . Maps and detailed analysis of the proposed flood hazard revisions can be reviewed at the Development Services Department at 141 W. Main Street Royse City, 75189.
