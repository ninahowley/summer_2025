Nebraska has joined states that have enacted a ban. Governor Jim Pillen this monthsigned a billinto law called the Stand With Women Act. The measure bars men and boys from joining girls\u2019 and women\u2019s sports teams. The U.S. Congress sought to ensure equal opportunity for girls and women in schools and education programs that receive federal funds. Title IX of the Education Amendments became law in 1972. \u201cWe cannot ignore that girls and women have the right to a level playing field when it comes to sports,\u201dsaidGov. Pillen. \u201cOtherwise, we are denying them opportunities to compete and win, earn scholarships and develop their own athletic abilities.\u201d Riley Gaines, former University of Kentucky graduate and swim team member, was present when the governor signed the bill. Gaines, an outspoken women\u2019s sports advocate, competed against a man calling himself Lia Thomas during the 2022 NCAA swimming championships. Laws that ban males in female sports also protect their privacy and safety. Men allowed on women\u2019s teams also have access to their changing rooms. Gaines testified before Congress about team members changing in a janitor\u2019s closet to avoid changing in front of Thomas. Gaines spoke to the governor about the bill two years ago. Afterward, he signed an executive order protecting women\u2019s sports. Payton McNabb, who was injured in a volleyball game after a man on the opposing team spiked the ball in her face, also attended the bill signing.
