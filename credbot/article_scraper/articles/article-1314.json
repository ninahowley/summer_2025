But if you\u2019re looking for a different type of watch party, now\u2019s the time to put your plans in place \u2014 whether you\u2019ll be heading to the epicenter of it all at Sunrise\u2019s Amerant Bank Arena during away games, or gathering at other spots opening up throughout the entire series this year.
