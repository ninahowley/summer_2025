We are happy to announce that a new ARU Press book published on June 1:Ayn Rand\u2019s Philosophic Achievement and Other Essaysby Harry Binswanger. This incisive collection of nine essays was originally printed on the occasion of Dr. Binswanger\u2019sretirementfrom ARI\u2019s board of directors, celebrating his \u201csixty years of writing about and teaching the philosophy of Objectivism.\u201d The book was given to donors at ARI\u2019s 2024 Gala. To bring it to a wider audience, ARU Press is now making it available for purchase by the public. The collection offers abundant evidence of the breadth of Dr. Binswanger\u2019s scholarship. From reflection on the foundations of morality to the analysis of key concepts in metaphysics and epistemology to commentary on literature and politics, Dr. Binswanger\u2019s philosophic insight on timeless and timely issues has ranged across the board. Consider the essay \u201cThe Possible Dream,\u201d which examines how and why the conventional meaning of the concept \u201cperfect\u201d is rooted in mysticism and ultimately destroys self-esteem. But there is a rational need for such a concept and Dr. Binswanger provides a rational, this-worldly conception of \u201cperfection,\u201d showing how it applies in ethics, politics, and epistemology. (Three essays have previously been published inNew Ideal: \u201cThe Possible Dream,\u201d \u201cAyn Rand\u2019s Philosophic Achievement,\u201d and \u201cA Tale of Two Novels.\u201d) In another essay, \u201cLife-Based Teleology and the Foundations of Ethics,\u201d Dr. Binswanger argues that all actions of biological organisms, whether conscious or not, are directed toward goals while inanimate entities are not. Drawing on Rand\u2019s philosophy (particularly \u201cThe Objectivist Ethics\u201d), he shows how this thesis helps provide the factual basis for value concepts and the basic premises of a rational ethics. Dr. Binswanger also analyzes important political debates. In debates about capitalism, we often hear that corporations wield tyrannical power over workers and markets, and so need to be regulated by the government. Dr. Binswanger argues that this charge involves a basic equivocation between economic power and political power. As he explains in \u201cThe Dollar and the Gun,\u201d the former means the ability to offer value through voluntary transactions, while the latter means the ability to threaten actual, physical force.
