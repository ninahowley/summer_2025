When Susan Yara speaks, there\u2019s a sense of clarity and purpose that feels earned \u2013 honed through years in front of the camera, behind the scenes and in the fast-paced world of beauty entrepreneurship. From broadcast journalism to founding the skincare brand Naturium, Yara\u2019s career reflects a rare mix of reinvention, intuition and grit. Today, she\u2019s one of the most influential voices inbeauty, but her journey started in the world of hard news. **From News to Digital Media Pioneer** Yara began her career believing she\u2019d be a traditional news reporter. After graduating, she landed her first role in New York City covering local news. But the rigid structure of hard news didn\u2019t quite fit. \u201cIt just wasn\u2019t exactly what I liked,\u201d she recalls. That realization led her to pivot into lifestyle journalism, landing atForbesat a pivotal time \u2013 right as the publication was beginning its digital transformation. Being part ofForbes\u2019early push into dot-com media gave her a front-row seat to the evolving nature of content. From there, she went on to help build digital platforms forPeople,PopSugarandNewBeauty. The experience eventually inspired her to start her own venture:Mixed Makeup, a YouTube channel aimed at skincare and cosmetic education. **Becoming the Brand** When Yara first started Mixed Makeup, she approached it like media. \u201cI wasn\u2019t thinking of myself as an influencer,\u201d she explains. She focused on high-quality content, often featuring multiple people and treating herself more as a journalist than the face of the brand. But as influencer culture evolved, so did her strategy. Viewers wanted personality, relatability and consistency \u2013 and that meant more ofher. \u201cAt some point it really shifted where I became the personality,\u201d Yara says. That personal branding move would eventually fuel her success \u2013 not only as a creator but also as a founder. **Building Naturium** Years of studying skin and beauty through content \u2013 and listening closely to her audience \u2013 led to a realization: there was a gap in the skincare market. High-performance products were either overpriced or under-delivering. People, including her own mother, were hesitant to use luxury skincare regularly for fear of \u201cwasting\u201d it. So she launched Naturium, a line of science-backed skincare products designed to be effective yet affordable. \u201cThe only time you really see results with your skin is if you\u2019re consistent,\u201d she explains. \u201cAnd to be consistent, you need products that you can afford to actually use.\u201d Inside Bubble Skincare: Shai Eisenman\u2019s mission to make high-quality beauty affordable Her strategy was smart, data-driven and deeply rooted in community insight. Unlike brands that spend heavily on packaging and marketing, Yara poured 80% of Naturium\u2019s budget into the formulas. The goal? Deliver clinical-level skincare that people could trust \u2013 and afford. In 2022, Naturium was acquired bye.l.f. Beauty, a move that gave the brand global distribution power. \u201cWe needed the power of a bigger company,\u201d Yara says, pointing to the logistical challenges of scaling an indie brand. With Naturium now in major retailers likeShoppers Drug MartandAmazon, the acquisition has only amplified what Yara and her team started. Despite the sale, she remains actively involved. \u201cThey wanted us to stay on board and do exactly what we\u2019re doing \u2013 just with their help,\u201d she says. The partnership has allowed her to keep building the brand\u2019s identity while expanding its reach. **Marketing with Authenticity** As someone with deep roots in digital strategy, Yara is refreshingly non-gimmicky when it comes to marketing. Naturium doesn\u2019t rely on flashy influencer campaigns; instead, it focuses on authentic word-of-mouth. \u201cWe like to find people who naturally talk about the product,\u201d she explains. Her team prioritizes micro-influencers, real customers and genuine reviews \u2013 often turning passionate user testimonials into paid ads. This approach mirrors her own standards as a creator. \u201cI always needed to try a product and develop a real opinion before I could ever do a sponsorship,\u201d she says. **Breaking Beauty Myths** One of Yara\u2019s biggest missions has been education. She challenges the idea that expensive skincare is inherently better and debunks misleading claims around \u201cmedical grade\u201d labels. Her content emphasizes consistency over quick fixes and ingredient efficacy over brand prestige. \u201cThe truth is, skincare is just a cosmetic,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s not a prescription. You have to use it every day for at least six weeks before you see real results.\u201d **Finding Fulfillment in Impact** Despite her high-profile career, Yara remains grounded by one simple reward: helping people. \u201cIt\u2019s so rewarding when someone tells me I helped change their skin,\u201d she says. For Yara, that\u2019s the most fulfilling part of the job. **Advice for Aspiring Creators and Entrepreneurs** When asked for advice, Yara gets personal. \u201cPeople talk a lot about imposter syndrome, but if you\u2019re working hard, you deserve to be here,\u201d she says. Her philosophy? Build relationships, embrace community over competition and trust your instincts. \u201cNobody\u2019s success has ever stopped my success,\u201d she adds. \u201cThe more I support people, the more they support me.\u201d From a newsroom rookie to the founder of one of skincare\u2019s most buzzed-about brands, Susan Yara\u2019s journey is a testament to the power of evolution, connection and showing up \u2013 consistently. Just like great skincare. **What is Susan Currently Loving?** Best bug repellents to keep you bite-free this summer Top summer picks for your next boat, beach or cabin escape You may also like: Tatcha The Brightening Serum \u2013 $125.00 Quantum Mud Mask \u2013 $65.99 Dermalogica Discover Healthy Skin Kit \u2013 $59.00 Rhode Pocket Blush \u2013 $24.00 Tatcha The Serum Stick \u2013 $64.00 Bioderma Sensibio Micellar Cleansing Oil \u2013 $26.99 5 things you need to know about sunscreen Barbet: The beverage redefining connection Be in the know before you shop with The Curator email sent twice a week. **More from Global News** Explore homegrown Canadian brands you\u2019ll love 5 things you need to know about sunscreen **More Recommendations** Best bug repellents to keep you bite-free this summer Top summer picks for your next boat, beach or cabin escape Best patio set deals you can buy right now 16 last minute Father\u2019s Day gift ideas Dad will love Best lighting to brighten up your outdoor space **Daily Deals** 15% off: Armani Beauty Acqua di Gi\u00f2 Profondo$170 on amazon (was $200) 15%: Hessawell Gold Silver Hoop Dangle Earrings$14.9517.59on Amazon 25% off: 100% Egyptian Cotton Bed Sheets$119.99139.99on Amazon 19% off: LEVOIT Air Purifier$72.8589.99on Amazon 17% off: Amazon Kindle$119.99144.99on Amazon **Top Videos** Poilievre calls for \u2018severe limits\u2019 on Canadian population growth137Viewed Canada Post, union exchange arbitration proposals as they return to talks36Viewed Global News at 5:30 Montreal: June 931Viewed Ontario keeps paying Beer Store agreement as alcohol revenue falls30Viewed Poilievre calls for \u2018severe limits\u2019 on Canadian population growth Nova Scotia woman demanding answers after breast cancer misdiagnosis Be in the know before you shop with The Curator email sent twice a week. **Report an Error** About Principles & Practices Branded Content Contact us RSS Newsletters Notifications Smart home Advertisers Election Registry Global News Licensing Requests Cookie consent Privacy Policy Copyright Terms of Use Advertise Advertising Standards Terms Corus Entertainment Accessibility"}
