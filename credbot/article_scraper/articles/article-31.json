At a hearing held by the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, senators raised questions about the current state of the country\u2019s aviation system to airline executive Bryan Bedford. The FAA administrator role has been filled by Chris Rocheleau on an interim basis since the departure of former Administrator Mike Whitaker on Inauguration Day. Top of the mind for senators was safety. If confirmed, Bedford would oversee the country\u2019s airspace system, which has dealt with several issues over the last six months, including fatal air travel incidents and an outdated air traffic control system that has experienced technology outages. \u201cThe system that manages our skies is showing its age,\u201d Bedford testified. \u201cThe stresses of this antiquated system truly came into view as we all returned to the skies after Covid. Chronic understaffing, controller fatigue, outdated facilities and telecommunications technology has placed a significant strain on the men and women at the FAA, and it has absolutely frustrated travelers with excessive delays and cancellations and has caused the public to question whether it\u2019s truly safe to fly.\u201d Senators pressed Bedford on major challenges facing the FAA as it grapples with repeat air traffic control systemsfailuresat the approach control facility for Newark Liberty International Airport; aging air traffic controlinfrastructurenationwide; and ashortageof 3,000 air traffic controllers. \u2018We need to shine a light on this\u2019 **\u2018We need to shine a light on this\u2019** **\u2018We need to shine a light on this\u2019** In attendance at Wednesday\u2019s hearing were the parents of Sam Lilley, the first officer killed in the midair collision at Reagan National Airport in January that killed 67 people. Bedford said he met with the families that lost loved ones in the tragedy. The crash led to aban on helicopter trafficon a four-mile stretch over the Potomac River. \u201cWe need to shine a light on this,\u201d Bedford said. \u201cTransparency is going to help us find permanent solutions.\u201d Bedford reiterated his top priority \u201cwill be public safety and restoring the public\u2019s confidence in flying.\u201d With regard to the crash, Sen. Jerry Moran, a Republican from Kansas, brought up legislation recently introduced involving ADS-B. Civilian and military aircraft use ADS-B, which helps an aircraft broadcast its location, altitude and other key factors while monitoring other aircraft aroundit. ADS-B Out broadcasts aircraft information, while ADS-B In allows aircraft to receive that information. \u201cADS-B In can be a significant safety improvement for the visibility of traffic because it incorporates the traffic that\u2019s on the ground,\u201d Bedford said. \u201cSo, when we look at the alerting systems that we have and we\u2019re relying on, even when we\u2019re using surface radars, it still requires the controller to be in the loop.\u201d But theArmy often turned it off while flying on missions in Washington. The NTSB previously confirmed the Army\u2019s Black Hawk helicopter involved in January\u2019s collision had the necessary equipment and was capable of transmitting, but investigators still do not know why it wasn\u2019t. A closed-door roundtable is expected later Wednesday among lawmakers regarding the safety troubles at Reagan National Airport. In May,some helicopter flights to the Pentagon were put on hold by the US Army pending an investigation after two planes at Reagan National Airport were forced to abort landings as a US Army Black Hawk helicopter approached the Pentagon nearby. Those Army helicopters were from the same unit as the one that crashed. At 4:15 p.m., the members of the Senate Subcommittee on Aviation will meet with Brig. Gen.Matthew Braman, director of Army Aviation; Rocheleau and Jennifer Homendy, chairwoman of the National Transportation Safety Board. Changing the required hours for pilots **Changing the required hours for pilots** **Changing the required hours for pilots** Bedford has long opposed a requirement for new pilots at commercial air carriers to obtain 1,500 flight hours, which many senators brought up during Wednesday\u2019s hearing. The rule was created after the crash ofContinental Connection Flight 3407near Buffalo, New York, which left 50 people dead. The NTSB found pilot error was to blame. His opposition to the ruledates as far back as 2014, when he testified at a hearingfor the House Subcommittee on Aviation. He called the rule \u201ca largely inflexible and arbitrary\u201d in his opening remarks. The rule left regional air carriers such as Republic Airways in a pilot shortage at the time. The families of those killed in the 2009 crash expressed \u201cserious concerns\u201d about Bedford\u2019s nomination, specifically citing his effort to circumvent the rule as CEO of Republic Airways. Bedford joined Republic in 1999 as president and CEO,according to the airline\u2019s website. Sen. Tammy Duckworth, a Democrat from Illinois and ranking member of the Aviation Subcommittee said Bedford was \u201cleaving the door open\u201d for changes to the FAA\u2019s required 1,500-flight-hour rule for first-time commercial airline pilots. \u201cI\u2019ve asked you four questions on whether or not you will unilaterally reduce the 1,500-hour rule \u2026 at no point have you answered yes, so you are leaving the door open,\u201d Duckworth said. Bedford did not outright say he was committing to maintaining the 1,500-hour rule, a pilot training requirement. During questioning, Bedford said reducing the flight hours was not his priority, stressing that he was more focused on \u201cfixing the air traffic control system.\u201d \u201cThere won\u2019t be safety loopholes, I commit to you,\u201d Bedford said. \u201cWe will never do anything to reduce the safety and competency of our pilots.\u201d CNN\u2019s Pete Muntean asked Bedford after the hearing about the 1,500-hour rule, but he did not comment further. Air traffic control system **Air traffic control system** **Air traffic control system** A top priority for the FAA is the dated air traffic control system. Paper strips and floppy discs \u2014 technology still used by controllers today \u2014 have become a talking point on Capitol Hill. The system, which has technology in use since the 1970s and \u201880s, has been in the spotlight recently because of at least four outages that occurred late this spring at Newark Liberty International Airport, where controllers lost sight of planes and technology went dark. Since then, Newark Airport has seen a number of fixes, butthe FAA doesn\u2019t expect it to be back to normal until October. The FAA announced plans in Mayto replace core infrastructure including radar, software, hardware and telecommunications networks to manage modern travel. Duffy has not yet disclosed how much the project would cost but is counting on Congress to deliver funding. \u201cI believe the agency can get back on the right track if we can all agree first that the air traffic control system needs significant investment,\u201d Bedford said. The agency recently issued aRequest for Informationfor a company to implement a \u201cbrand new air traffic control system over the next three years.\u201d It has identified five areas of interest for a new system: telecommunications, radio communications, surveillance, automation and facilities. It\u2019s unclear how this will impact Verizon\u2019s contract with the FAA to modernize the system.Verizon has a massive $2.4 billion contractto provide a long-sought upgrade to the FAA\u2019s communications system, known as the FAA Enterprise Network Services, or FENS, program. Sen. John Hickenlooper, a Democrat from Colorado, asked Bedford what ideas he had to address the air traffic control problems. \u201cI think one of the challenges have is a lack of trust,\u201d Bedford said,echoing written remarks he submitted to senators ahead of the hearing. \u201cThere\u2019s a lack of trust issues within the FAA and between the FAA and some of the stakeholders, and it\u2019s been explained to me why some of those issues there are, but we have to move past that. We will have to embrace transparency and accountability as we move forward this process.\u201d CNN\u2019s Pete Muntean contributed to this report.
