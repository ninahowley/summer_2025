An environmental group claims rescinding the rule would cost lives.** FARGO \u2014 President Donald Trump\u2019s administration plans to repeal two Biden-era rules that North Dakota leaders saywould threaten the state\u2019s coal industry. But rescinding the rule could cost lives, an environmental group said. ADVERTISEMENT The Environmental Protection Agency has proposed rescinding the Clean Power Plan 2.0 and a Mercury and Air Toxics Standards, or MATS, rule, according to a release issued Wednesday, June 11. North Dakota\u2019s congressional delegation and North DakotaGov. Kelly Armstrongcelebrated the development. \u201cToday\u2019s action by the EPA is a win for U.S. energy dominance and supports continued access to the affordable and reliable baseload power provided by coal,\u201d Sen.John Hoeven,R-N.D., said in a statement. The EPA needs to finalize its decision to rescind the rules. It's unclear when that may happen.

Biden aimed to cut back greenhouse gas emissions and slowclimate change. Biden\u2019s EPA also called on coal-fired power plants to reduce the amount of toxic metal emissions released into the atmosphere. Mercury in the air can be dangerous for certain populations, including pregnant women and children, according to the Sierra Club, an environmental advocacy group. \u201cIt\u2019s completely reprehensible that Donald Trump would seek to roll back these lifesaving standards and do more harm to the American people and our planet just to earn some brownie points with the fossil fuel industry,\" Sierra Club Climate Policy Director Patrick Drupp said in a statement. \"This repeal means more climate disasters, more heart attacks, more asthma attacks, more birth defects, more premature deaths.\" Lignite coal-fired plants, like the five in North Dakota, initially had to reduce mercury emissions by 70% before July 8, 2027. Trump extended that deadline by two years after the coal industry said technology to reduce mercury emissions didn\u2019t exist. ADVERTISEMENT The MATS rule would cost coal plants in 12 states, including North Dakota, $1.2 billion over a decade starting in 2028, the EPA said in its Wednesday news release. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin criticized Biden\u2019s Clean Power Plan, claiming its purpose was to \u201cregulate coal, oil and gas out of existence.\u201d \u201cAffordable, reliable electricity is key to the American dream and a natural byproduct of national energy dominance,\u201d Zeldin said in a statement. \u201cAccording to many, the primary purpose of these Biden-Harris administration regulations was to destroy industries that didn't align with their narrow-minded climate change zealotry. Repealing the Clean Power Plan would save the power sector $19 billion in regulatory costs, the EPA said. U.S. Sen Kevin Cramer, Hoeven and Armstrong called the Biden-era rules an overreach. Armstrong said he met with Zeldin last month in Washington, D.C., to discuss the rules. In a statement, Armstrong said the Clean Power Plan would \u201ceffectively shut down existing coal-fired power plants by requiring them to curb greenhouse gas emissions by 90% by 2032.\u201d MATS threatened the power grid and would force coal plants to prematurely close, Armstrong said. \u201cIt\u2019s refreshing to finally have a regulatory agency that takes input from the people who produce what the world needs \u2013 and allows them to do it better than anyone else while protecting the environment,\u201d the governor wrote. ADVERTISEMENT The two rules targeted North Dakota\u2019s energy industries, Cramer said. \u201cIn North Dakota, we mine lignite coal and produce very reliable, long-term, steady electricity at a low cost,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cI\u2019ve always resented that somebody in this building, at EPA, thought they cared more about the air, land, water and economy than I did and my family did.\u201d The Biden rules would threaten the reliability of the country\u2019s power grid and weaken national security, U.S. Rep. Julie Fedorchak, R-N.D., said in a statement. \u201cUnder the Trump administration, the EPA is charting a new course \u2014 one that supports the responsible development of the natural resources we\u2019ve been blessed with for the good of the American people,\u201d she said in calling the potential repeal \u201ca big win for North Dakota energy and American manufacturing.\u201d ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT AccountManage My AccountPrivacy PolicyTerms and ConditionsPolicies and StandardsSubscriber Benefits Manage My Account Privacy Policy Terms and Conditions Policies and Standards Subscriber Benefits Manage My Account Privacy Policy Terms and Conditions Policies and Standards Subscriber Benefits NewsSubscription OptionsEmail NewslettersE-PaperOur News Network Subscription Options Email Newsletters E-Paper Our News Network Subscription Options Email Newsletters E-Paper Our News Network ContactGet HelpContact UsAdvertise With UsGet Our Advertising NewsletterCareers Get Help Contact Us Advertise With Us Get Our Advertising Newsletter Careers Get Help Contact Us Advertise With Us Get Our Advertising Newsletter Careers MoreJobsHQClassifiedsPublic Notices JobsHQ Classifieds Public Notices JobsHQ Classifieds Public Notices Twitter Facebook"}
