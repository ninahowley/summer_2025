But he never thought he would become a victim again \u2013 this time because of a foreign leader thousands of kilometres away. He was scheduled to leave Hong Kong for resettlement in the US on February 4, but the plan was in shambles after Donald Trump was re-elected president. In January, Peter \u2013 who declined to disclose his full name and country of origin due to safety concerns \u2013 made preparations for his departure. \u201cI packed almost everything, resigned from my job as a pastor, and prepared to return the subdivided unit to the landlord,\u201d he recalled. But on January 20, just hours after taking office, President Trump \u2013 infamous for his anti-immigrant rhetoric \u2013signedan executive order, indefinitely suspending the US Refugee Admission Program (USRAP). The executive order also called for a report from the Department of Homeland Security within 90 days to consider whether to resume refugee admissions. Yet, the April 20 deadline came and wentwithoutany announcement. With a stroke of a pen, Trump has upended the lives of many refugees like Peter around the world. They face a life in limbo, unable to enter the US despite having received approval for resettlement, and are forced to stay in a place without a path to permanent residency or citizenship. The number of refugeesadmittedinto the US annually actually decreased, from over 200,000 in 1980, when USRAP started, to around 100,000 in 2024, before Trump began his second term. Citing \u201cthe interests of the United States\u201d and the country\u2019s lack of \u201cability to absorb large numbers of migrants, and in particular, refugees,\u201d Trump ordered the suspension of USRAP. Criticsslammedthe decision, calling it \u201cunjustified\u201d and pointing out that studies \u2013 including those by the government \u2013 showed refugees \u201chave a positive economic effect on the United States.\u201d As a victim of Trump\u2019s orders, Peter felt disappointed while trying to be understanding. \u201cIt is unfair to us but the fairest thing from their perspective,\u201d Peter told HKFP, referring to US policymakers. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to sort out their house, to fix their house, right?\u201d With many voters supporting Trump in the US presidential election, he believed that \u201cno single person can be blamed\u201d for the policy. \u201cI understand that people handling refugee cases are also kind of overwhelmed\u2026 struggling to screen out who is a genuine refugee, but again, that doesn\u2019t give them the right to make [the lives of] people who are genuine refugees so hard,\u201d Peter said. People don\u2019t choose to become refugees, he added. \u201cRefugees are victims of circumstances, victims of people\u2019s decisions, victims of people\u2019s fights, and they find themselves to be victims for a lifetime.\u201d As of October 2024, there were 37.9 million refugees worldwide,accordingto the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). In Hong Kong, there were 359 recognised refugees from late 2009 to March 2025, the Immigration Department\u2019s data showed. Now, four months after the ill-fated news, Peter has slowly got back on his feet. After back-and-forth negotiations with his landlord, he was allowed to stay in the subdivided flat. His church agreed to hire him as a pastor again. In late April, he started working after receiving a work permit from the Hong Kong Immigration Department. \u201cI am the luckiest,\u201d said Peter, in his 40s, as he compared himself with many other refugees affected by the US ban. But like them, he was pessimistic about future resettlement. \u201cMany [in the refugee community] were hopeful over the [90-day review]. Now, nobody has a clear direction for the future,\u201d he said. **\u2018Back to square one\u2019** The Christian Action Centre for Refugees is located in the labyrinth of Chungking Mansion. On one May afternoon, social worker and centre-in-charge Jeffrey Andrews was busy preparing for an online meeting with representatives of refugees and asylum seekers to give them information on the centre\u2019s services and resettlement updates, especially the US\u2019s. Andrews and his team tried to verify relevant news stories before they briefed the community to avoid giving them false hope. Around 10 refugees served by the centre had prepared to leave for the US before the suspension was announced. \u201cSome had resigned from their jobs, their kids had withdrawn from school, and their house had been returned to the landlord,\u201d Andrews said. Once they found themselves unable to get on the planes to the US, \u201cthey are back to square one, just like the day they arrived in Hong Kong to seek asylum.\u201d Most refugees directly affected by Trump\u2019s policy have not secured jobs in Hong Kong again after resigning in preparation for departure, he said. Dozens of refugees he knows expect their waiting time for resettlement to be prolonged. **From asylum seekers to resettlement** There were more than 15,000 asylum seekers in Hong Kong as of June 2024,accordingto the local NGO Justice Centre Hong Kong. They must go through lengthy screening and security vetting procedures before they finally see a glimpse of hope for overseas resettlement. The city, however, does not grant resettlement. Upon arriving in Hong Kong, asylum seekers can file non-refoulement claims with the city\u2019s Immigration Department, whichassesseswhether their claims of fear of persecution are substantiated. If so, the government will not refoul them from Hong Kong. It will refer their cases to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to decide their refugee status. If UNHCR recognises them as refugees, it will try to arrange resettlement, mainly to Canada and the US, the world\u2019slargestresettlement countries. Only after refugees are resettled do they gain the right to become naturalised citizens. \u201cBut resettlement is not a right for refugees according to UNHCR, which means it is not guaranteed,\u201d said Andrews. Starting from their arrival in Hong Kong, asylum seekers wait an average of 10-15 years to be recognised as refugees and to be resettled in a third country, the social worker said. Peter was a school principal when he fled his country after suffering torture and political persecution. He arrived in Hong Kong in 2016 and had to wait around one year to be recognised as a refugee, which he said was \u201crelatively fast.\u201d It took him another seven years to be resettled. He said he was thrilled when UNHCR told him that the US had granted him asylum and that the US Citizenship and Immigration Services had approved his resettlement. Niki Wong, a programme manager at Branches of Hope, a Vine Church-founded NGO serving refugees and asylum seekers, told HKFP that refugees endured a longer waiting time over the past few years because Western countries suspended refugee resettlement during the Covid-19 pandemic. However, just as the resettlement programme returned to normal, they were hit by Trump\u2019s refugee ban. Wong said that although most US-bound refugees he knows could find a place to live and carry on with their lives in the city, they still felt frustrated and hopeless because of an uncertain future. **Decades of waiting** Aim\u00e9 Girimana, who has been in Hong Kong for 21 years, is another African refugee affected by Trump\u2019s policy. Girimana, who works as a community partnerships officer at Justice Centre Hong Kong, was a human rights lawyer in an East African country. He arrived in Hong Kong in 2004, leaving behind his wife and children, to escape political persecution in his home country. \u201cAs I knew my life was under threat, I fled from my office directly to the airport,\u201d he told HKFP. At that time, UNHCR \u2013 not the Immigration Department \u2013 was responsible for assessing persecution claims in Hong Kong. Girimana said it took only three days for him to be recognised as a refugee, but waiting for resettlement was far longer than he had ever imagined. He said UNHCR had difficulties finding him permanent asylum because of his political activism in his home country. In 2006, UNHCR assigned him to be resettled in Canada, but Canadian authorities refused. It was not until December 2023 that he learned the US had expanded theWelcome Corpsprogramme, allowing private individuals to sponsor refugees they know and welcome them to be resettled in the US under USRAP. Girimana successfully reached out to five American sponsors as requested by the programme. He went through the first interview in October and was waiting for the final interview when Trump announced the suspension of USRAP, including the Welcome Corps. \u201cAs a human being, your life is always dependent on others. It\u2019s just like that anybody can decide on your life,\u201d he said. Nonetheless, Girimana, who is in his 60s, is grateful to have a job in Hong Kong that allows him to work with the refugee community. It took years for him to get to where he is today. **\u2018It\u2019s my duty\u2019** When he arrived in Hong Kong, Girimana found it difficult to support himself because refugees and asylum seekers were not allowed to work. He took the initiative to collect food, clothes, and electrical appliances for refugee and asylum seeker families. He also worked with lawmakers and spoke at Legislative Council sessions to raise awareness. Girimana recalled that in his early years in Hong Kong, refugees and asylum seekers were either treated as if they were invisible or faced prejudice. \u201cPrejudice [against] refugees was really bad. People didn\u2019t have any awareness of refugees and thought that refugees were the same as economic immigrants,\u201d he said. Having no legal right to work, most refugees and asylum seekers rely on a monthly allowance that the government only began to provide in 2006. In 2014, the government increased the allowance, giving an adult asylum seeker or refugee a total of HK$3,200 to HK$3,420 in monthly assistance \u2013 HK$1,500 for rent, HK$300 for utilities, HK$200 to HK$420 for transport, and HK$1,200 in food coupons \u2013 plus a rent deposit of HK$3,000. The amounts have not changed since. In 2010, Girimana was among four refugees and a torture claimant who filed a judicialreviewof their right to work in Hong Kong. They lost in the Court of First Instance and the Court of Appeal in2011and2012, respectively. The case ultimately went to the Court of Final Appeal. The top courtruledin2014, upholding the lower courts\u2019 decisions that refugees have no constitutional right to work but do have a \u201cdiscretionary permit\u201d granted by the director of the Immigration Department. In 2013, Girimana got his first job in Hong Kong. It set a precedent, allowing refugees with a job offer to apply for permission to work from the Immigration Department. Uzma Naveed, a refugee from a country in South Asia, has been working as a diversity and inclusion coordinator at the Centre for Refugees for nearly two years. She told HKFP that she arrived in Hong Kong 10 years ago with her husband and child after religious persecution forced them to flee their country. Their lives changed overnight, from a comfortable middle-class existence to living hand to mouth. Uzma was finally recognised as a refugee in 2023 after going through exhaustive screenings for eight years, essentially \u2013 in her words \u2013 \u201crepeating the trauma again and again.\u201d She and her family are still waiting for UNHCR\u2019s resettlement. However, with the USRAP suspension, she does not see much hope in the near future of finding a permanent home. At the Centre for Refugees, she organises activities, including cooking, sewing, yoga, and basketball, for refugees and asylum seekers to build \u201ca home away from home.\u201d \u201cEvery refugee has some kind of depression. No one is living a good life,\u201d said Uzma, in her 30s. For refugees and asylum seekers \u2013 many of whom live in subdivided units \u2013 knowing others with similar experiences can be empowering, she added. In early February, four American NGOs filed a lawsuit challenging Trump\u2019s refugee ban and funding halt for refugee humanitarian aid. On May 15, a federal judgeorderedthe Trump administration to \u201cimmediately\u201d resettle around 160 refugees who were scheduled to travel to the US on or before February 3. For an additional 120,000 refugees \u201cwho had arranged and confirmable travel\u201d to the US after February 3, the court would appoint an official to help conduct a case-by-case review. However, as of Saturday, the Trump administration has yet to take any action. Peter is unsure about his resettlement, saying it depends on whether the US will lift the ban. Meanwhile, prejudices against asylum seekers and refugees persist. Some Hong Kong lawmakers still talk about \u201cbogus refugees\u201d who they claimcommitcrimes andwastepublic expenditure \u2013 allegations that activists call \u201cracist\u201d and \u201cxenophobic.\u201d Despite living in limbo, Girimana is determined to continue raising public awareness. \u201cIt\u2019s my duty when I fled my country,\u201d he said, adding that people should not think refugees are economic migrants. \u201cYou could blame the system [of screening refugees], but don\u2019t blame those people looking for safety as refugees.\u201d Support HKFP|Policies & Ethics|Error/typo?|Contact Us|Newsletter|Transparency & Annual Report|Apps Help safeguard press freedom & keep HKFP free for all readers bysupporting our team **LATEST FROM HKFP** **Google searches for \u2018secessionist\u2019 online game surge in Hong Kong after authorities warn residents to delete app** **US, China agree on trade \u2018framework\u2019 after high-level talks in London** **Anti-corruption watchdog charges ex-lecturer who allegedly solicited HK$20,000 bribe from student** **Billions of data records relating to Chinese citizens leaked online, including WeChat and Alipay details** Support HKFP|Code of Ethics|Error/typo?|Contact Us|Newsletter|Annual & Transparency Report **Irene ChanFeatures Editor** x linkedin Irene Chan is a reporter at Hong Kong Free Press and has an interest in covering political and social change.
