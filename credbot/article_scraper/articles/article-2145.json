It is based on the presentation by Mary-Alice Waters, a longtime member of the National Committee of the Socialist Workers Party and president of Pathfinder Press, to the First International Conference of Theoretical Publications of Parties and Movements of the Left, held in Havana, Feb. 10-12, 2023. It was printed in theMilitant, March 6, 2023. Waters was addressing one of the three main themes of the event, \u201cFidel and International Solidarity.\u201d Copyright \u00a9 2025 by Pathfinder Press. Reprinted by permission. During the early years of the revolution, Fidel proudly explained to the world how the working people of Cuba shaped him and made him who he became. I, too, once belonged to an organization, he said in 1964, referring to the July 26 Movement he founded in 1955 along with other revolutionists. \u201cBut the glories of that organization are the glories of Cuba; they are the glories of the people; they belong to all of us. And there came a day that I stopped belonging to that organization.\u201d **Revolution and the roadto peace in Colombia** As the Freedom Caravan moved through the towns and cities of Cuba in the first days of January 1959, along the road from Santiago to Havana, Fidel said, \u201cI saw lots of men and women, hundreds and thousands of men and women with the red and black uniforms of the July 26 Movement. But many thousands more wore uniforms that weren\u2019t black and red but were the work shirts of workers and farmers and other men and women of the people.\u201d It was then we realized \u201cwe had truly accomplished something that was greater than ourselves,\u201d Fidel said. \u201cThey are the strength, the backbone of the revolution! Fist, arm, muscle of the revolutionary people, of the working class, of the peasants, of the workers!\u201d **Peoples of Cuba and the world** If Fidel belongs first to the working people of Cuba, however, he also belongs to the oppressed and exploited peoples the world over. And under his leadership, from Latin America and the Caribbean, to Africa and Asia, to North America and Europe, the working people of Cuba have shown us in action what proletarian internationalism means. They have shown us that the internationalism of the working class in power is not primarily a foreign policy. It must be an extension of the revolution itself, inseparable from its strength \u2014 even its survival. Fidel explained this to the Cuban people with crystal clarity in July 1976, during the earliest days of Cuba\u2019s internationalist mission to aid the people of Angola and Namibia, who were facing the aggression of the apartheid regime of South Africa and its Washington promoters. In Fidel\u2019s memorable words, \u201cThose not willing to fight for the freedom of others will never be able to fight for their own.\u201d Some fifteen years later, in May 1991, Ra\u00fal [Castro] closed that chapter of history, which by all measures stands as Cuba\u2019s greatest act of international solidarity. Cuba was already confronting some of the most difficult days of the revolution, the Special Period, precipitated by the implosion of the Soviet bloc and sudden evaporation of some 85 percent of the country\u2019s trade relations. Around the world Cuba\u2019s enemies were gloating that the days of the Cuban Revolution too were numbered. Receiving the last of the Cuban volunteers returning to Cuban soil, Ra\u00fal drew the real balance sheet: \u201cWhen we face new and unexpected challenges we will always be able to recall the epic of Angola with gratitude,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause without Angola we would not be as strong as we are today.\u201d That strength was decisive in surmounting the challenges of the Special Period. **Moral strengths of leadership** Where did Fidel\u2019s moral strengths as a leader of Cuba\u2019s working people come from? His ability to lead them to accomplish the epic feats of Cuba\u2019s socialist revolution? He gave us a piece of the answer in the tribute he paid Ernesto Che Guevara in 1987 on the 20th anniversary of Che\u2019s death in combat. \u201cChe believed in man,\u201d Fidel said. \u201cAnd if we don\u2019t believe in man, if we think that man is an incorrigible little animal, capable of advancing only if you tempt him with a carrot or hit him with a stick \u2014 anyone who believes this will never be a revolutionary, will never be a socialist, will never be a communist.\u201d Those were not empty words. Fidel was laying out the ethical foundation, the proletarian morality, our morals, that guided his own course of action and leadership example, throughout his life. The examples and testaments to this are countless. **Never killed a prisoner** \u201cThe Rebel Army and the militia never killed a prisoner, tortured a prisoner, nor abandoned a single wounded enemy soldier,\u201d explained Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n Fern\u00e1ndez, commander of the main column of revolutionary forces that routed the US-backed invasion at the Bay of Pigs in 1961. \u201cNot during the struggle in the Sierra, not in the struggle against the bandits, not at Gir\u00f3n. \u201cThat is a matter of principle, of ethics, in our armed forces, one Fidel has strictly demanded from the beginning of the revolutionary struggle.\u201d From the very first battle in the Sierras, \u201cour medical supplies were used for all the wounded, without distinction,\u201d both the Rebel Army\u2019s and those in Batista\u2019s armed forces, Fidel said in Ignacio Ramonet\u2019s hundred-hour interview with the Cuban leader. \u201cCaptured soldiers were allowed to go absolutely free,\u201d Fidel said. \u201cWe had an invariable policy of respect for the adversary\u2019s integrity. \u2026 There were cases of enlisted men who surrendered as many as three times, and three times we would release them.\u201d Since we disembarked from theGranma,Fidel underlined, our guidelines have been \u201cno assassination, no civilian victims, no use of the methods of terror,\u201d no acts \u201cin which innocent people might be killed. That\u2019s not contemplated in any revolutionary doctrine. \u201cNo war is ever won through terrorism. It\u2019s that simple,\u201d Fidel said. Because if you employ terrorism, \u201cyou earn the opposition, hatred and rejection of those whom you need in order to win the war.\u201d That\u2019s why at the end of the war \u201cwe had the support of over 90 percent of the population.\u201d \u201cFor us it was a philosophy, a principle, that innocent people must not be sacrificed. It was always a principle \u2014 practically a dogma. \u201cBatista\u2019s soldiers would go around stealing, burning houses and killing people,\u201d Fidel told Ramonet. \u201cThecampesinoscould see that we, on the other hand, respected them. We paid them for the food and other things we got from them.\u201d Without those policies, \u201cwe would never have won the war.\u201d Tet\u00e9 Puebla was second in command of the Rebel Army\u2019s women\u2019s platoon created by Fidel and later the first woman to reach the rank of general in Cuba\u2019s Revolutionary Armed Forces. In her account,Marianas in Combat,she describes how the mothers, widows, and children of Batista\u2019s soldiers who died in combat were treated. The widows weren\u2019t to blame \u201cfor the murders the army of the dictatorship committed,\u201d she said. \u201cSo we looked after them in the same way. \u2026 Whenever we set up a school with a group of children, we didn\u2019t talk about who their parents were. Only those of us in charge of them knew. We protected these children,\u201d she said. Now they are part of the revolution. \u201cThe widows and mothers of the Batista army collect a pension.\u201d \u201cWe identify with all peoples of the world who fight against misery and hunger,\u201d Tet\u00e9 said. \u201cThese principles of the revolution are the moral foundation of our struggle.\u201d **The value of a human life** As the commander in chief of the Revolutionary Armed Forces, Fidel was deeply concerned not only for the physical well-being of his forces and the care of the wounded. He was concerned for their mental health, their humanity. Harry Villegas, known the world over by the nom de guerre Pombo \u2014 given him by Che, as they fought side by side in the Congo in 1965 \u2014 served for more than five years as the liaison between the Cuban high command in Angola and the Revolutionary Armed Forces special command post in Havana, headed by Fidel. In Pombo\u2019s bookCuba and Angola: The War for Freedom,he recounts a telling example of Fidel\u2019s vigilance over the moral conduct of the Cuban internationalists during the Angola mission \u2014 not only of their actions, but even the perception of those actions. \u201cThere was an incident in which a Cuban pilot mistakenly dropped bombs on a home in aquimbo,a hamlet, and some civilians were killed,\u201d Pombo recounted. \u201cFidel insisted the pilot be tried in Angola under that country\u2019s laws. [Angolan President Agostinho] Neto said it hadn\u2019t been done deliberately; the pilot wasn\u2019t prosecuted.\u201d Nonetheless, Pombo continued, \u201cFidel gave the order that the pilot be withdrawn from the war. War starts to affect a person\u2019s psychology, he said. Your interaction with death can begin to lessen how you value life; you start getting accustomed to death. \u201cFidel sought in every way to prevent us from becoming psychologically warped and turned into people for whom life had no value.\u201d **No crime in name of revolution** These same moral foundations underlay the outrage \u2014 and bitterness \u2014 Fidel expressed on learning of the assassination in 1983 of Maurice Bishop, the central leader of the revolutionary government of the East Caribbean island of Grenada. During a counterrevolutionary coup by a Stalinist faction led by Bernard Coard, Bishop and other revolutionary leaders were murdered by soldiers acting on orders by Coard\u2019s clique. Working people and youth who had poured into the streets to defend the revolution were also killed. \u201cNo doctrine, no principle or position held up as revolutionary, and no internal division, justifies atrocious proceedings like the physical elimination of Bishop and the outstanding group of honest and worthy leaders killed yesterday,\u201d Fidel announced publicly the very next day. \u201cNo crime must be committed in the name of revolution and freedom.\u201d It was the same principles that led Fidel in 2008 to publicly condemn the course of the Manuel Marulanda leadership of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) for kidnapping civilians and holding them hostage, sometimes for years under harsh jungle conditions. \u201cThese were objectively cruel actions,\u201d Fidel wrote in an article July 3, 2008. \u201cNo revolutionary aim could justify them.\u201d And it was the same moral foundation that led Fidel in 2010 to not only recognize the national aspirations of the Palestinian people but also to speak out in unequivocal terms against the Holocaust denial of then Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone has been more slandered than the Jews,\u201d Fidel said in a widely circulated interview. The Jews have \u201clived an existence that is much harder than ours. There is nothing that compares to the Holocaust.\u201d \u201cWithout a doubt,\u201d Fidel stated in response to a question, the state of Israel has the right to exist. *** * *** I\u2019ll finish with one last example. One of the greatest moments of Fidel\u2019s international leadership came in 1979, when he addressed the United Nations General Assembly in New York City on behalf of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries, whose presidency he had recently assumed. \u201cI have not come to speak about Cuba,\u201d he told the delegates. \u201cI do not come to denounce before this assembly the aggressions to which our small but honorable country has been subjected for twenty years. Nor have I come to offend with unnecessary adjectives the powerful neighbor in his own house,\u201d he said. \u201cI speak on behalf of the children of the world who do not have even a piece of bread.\u201d In the mouths of many, those words would have seemed sentimental, hollow rhetoric. Coming from Fidel, they captured the course of his lifetime. Protest killings and attacks on Jews From Washington, DC to Boulder, Colorado!
