At the Fiber Broadband Association\u2019s FiberConnect conference in Nashville this week, several state broadband chiefs shared both their frustration and trepidation regarding anticipated changes to the $42.45 billion program. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick in March announced intentions to \u201crevamp\u201d the program, including \u201cto cut government red tape that slows down infrastructure construction.\u201d Lutnick also signaled his intention to remove the program\u2019s \u201cfiber first\u201d stipulation, which would allow states to give more of their BEAD funding to alternative technology providers, such assatellite internet service providers\u2014 a move some states are also pushing for. However, in some states, these yet-to-be-seen changes have had the opposite of Lutnick\u2019s intended effect to speed things along. Some state broadband leaders said the uncertainty has forced them to slow down their BEAD projects. And, while the states were expecting these changes to be released by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration last month, the guidancemay not even appear until July. Sally Doty, director of the Office of Broadband Expansion and Accessibility of Mississippi, said her office currently has its BEAD application window open, though she said she was not sure when it was going to close because they are awaiting the NTIA\u2019s guidance to see if any adjustments will be necessary to the program. Bree Maki, executive director of the Minnesota Office of Broadband Development, said her state, too, pumped the brakes on BEAD. Her office wrapped its first round of the BEAD subgrantee selection process \u2014 which includes gathering proposals from internet service providers \u2014 last April, she said, but moving onto the second round has been slowed so as not to create duplicative work for vendor applicants. \u201cIt\u2019s more complicated than it appears on the paper,\u201d Maki said. \u201cBut also, you know, elephant in the room, we all know that guidance is coming. So, one thing that we really considered in the state was not to move forward too fast and put our ISPs through another grant application that might have to be redone to the beginning.\u201d Michigan Chief Connectivity Officer Eric Fredrick said his state \u2014 which has the country\u2019s third largest number of BEAD-eligible locations \u2014 has also wrapped its first round of gathering proposals. He said that while the process was a great success, \u201cwe\u2019re waiting for that policy news [from the NTIA] to see how much of that we\u2019re going to have to redo or not.\u201d Despite the imminent changes, other states are proceeding with BEAD planning. Rebecca Dilg, director of the Utah Broadband Center, said her state has completed its first round of gathering proposals from ISPs and hopes the center will open the required second round in \u201cthe next couple of days.\u201d She added that despite the anticipated changes to BEAD, Utah is \u201cnot stopping.\u201d \u201cI will say that we have decided to not pause. We are actually not delayed. We\u2019re right in the timeline of where we have projected that we would be. In July is when we need to have everything wrapped up and turned in. We\u2019ll be close to that, granted that there\u2019s not massive changes to the [BEAD] policy,\u201d Dilg said. \u201cWhich, rumor has it, that that\u2019ll be out any day now. That rumor has been out there for quite awhile.\u201d Meanwhile, in neighboring Nevada, Brian Mitchell, director of the Governor\u2019s Office of Science, Innovation and Technology, said Monday that as one of the three states that has received final approval from the NTIA, the looming changes have not yet impacted how the state intends to proceed. \u201cWe\u2019re just waiting on some final paperwork from the Department of Commerce before we can get started with our program \u2014 unless, of course, something else happens, so I\u2019ll leave it there,\u201d Mitchell said. In April, the NTIAgranted states a 90-day extensionto submit their final proposals. Mitchell said the extension didn\u2019t do much for Nevada, mainly because the state had already moved through the majority of the process. Utah\u2019s Dilg said the extension means nothing without having the official programs changes released in the form of new guidance. \u201cEven though we are given 90 days \u2014 I know the other state broadband leaders are with me on this \u2014 we are waiting when it comes to the policy,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was a period of time when NTIA had just gone quiet for months and months.\u201d Dilg urged other state broadband leaders and internet providers to contact elected officials and the NTIA to be included in the upcoming policy changes. \u201cThis has got to a point, and it might be with many of you,\u201d Dilg said to the conference, \u201cit\u2019s been very frustrating as you think, \u2018Well, I guess we\u2019re not doing anything. We better wait until we wait and see what the policy is.\u2019 It\u2019s like, no, we don\u2019t want to wait to see what the policy is. We want to be part of forming that policy. So I\u2019d say that\u2019s one more thing that we are doing during this 90-day pause, is we\u2019re making sure we are reaching out or involve letters from our governors, senators, whatnot, that are going to the NTIA and having lots of conversations with them.\u201d Broadband Broadband Equity Access and Deployment (BEAD) Howard Lutnick NTIA State & Local News Facebook LinkedIn Twitter Copy Link **More Like This** Hawaii to create statewide broadband officeByKeely Quinlan **Hawaii to create statewide broadband office** **Hawaii to create statewide broadband office** Commerce Sec.
