In a statement released this afternoon, Iarnr\u00f3d \u00c9ireann confirmed that the issue had originated in Blackrock, saying: \u201cRail services between Lansdowne Road and Dalkey are currently suspended due to damage to overhead lines.\u201d Dublin Bus will be accepting rail tickets for affected DART customers, according to the company. Commuter delays are also expected on connected routes. \u201cDublin Bus are accepting rail tickets for DART customers affected,\u201d the statement continued. \u201cBus transfers are in operation between Dublin Connolly and Bray for Dublin / Rosslare Europort services.\u201d The company added that repairs are underway, but gave no estimate for full service restoration. \u201cWe are working to rectify the damage, but do not currently have a time for services to be restored,\u201d Iarnr\u00f3d \u00c9ireann said. \u201cDisruption is expected to continue throughout the evening peak.\u201d The company apologised to customers for the inconvenience. \u201cIarnr\u00f3d \u00c9ireann apologises to customers for the inconvenience caused,\u201d it stated. In an alert issued on social media shortly after 6pm, the company described the incident as a \u201cmajor disruption to DART services\u201d and confirmed that services were \u201csuspended between Lansdowne Road and Dalkey until further notice\u201d due to \u201can issue with the overhead lines at Blackrock.\u201d Rail infrastructure in the Dublin area has faced recurring problems in recent years, particularly with overhead line equipment (OHLE), which supplies electric power to DART services. Similar issues caused temporary shutdowns on the southern coastal line in March of this year. The affected stretch includes key commuter stations such as Blackrock, D\u00fan Laoghaire, and Dalkey, serving thousands of passengers daily during peak hours. Irish Rail\u2019s track worker safety manual states that the overhead line equipment (OHLE) used to power the DART operates at 1,500 volts of direct current and is classified as \u201cextremely dangerous.\u201d The manual advises workers to \u201calways consider the OHLE to be \u2018live\u2019,\u201d warning that any contact with it \u201cmay result in death or serious injury.\u201d Dear Reader, It is a simple statement of fact that if you are looking for diversity of thought in the Irish media, you will struggle to find it. That is why we founded Gript \u2013 to serve the gap in the market left by so many of our colleagues, when they decided that the job of journalists was not to challenge consensus thought, but to herd around it, and defend it fiercely. If you are looking for a media outlet that blames everything on the \u201cfar right\u201d in Ireland, then you don\u2019t have to go far to find one. If, by contrast, you are looking for a media outlet that looks beyond that cheap sloganeering, and tries to understand and report on the real concerns held by ordinary people \u2013 and a good few prominent people, albeit privately \u2013 then that is what we try to do here. But we cannot do it without your support, and your subscription. We reject Government funding, because, in our view, that would be the end of our independence. The moment we did so, we would begin looking over our shoulder, and wondering if our coverage of a particular issue might lead to that money being taken away. In time \u2013 not all at once, but slowly and inexorably \u2013 we would become just another safe, consensus, state-funded voice. But there\u2019s a bargain to be struck here: If you value our independence, then you must support it. If you want us to be answerable to you, then you must take a stake in our work. What we try to do here is to be open, honest, and brave. That does not mean that you will always agree with us. It does mean that there will be times when we will annoy you, and publish things you disagree with: That\u2019s part of the deal. We are independent, not servants of one cause, or another. That is what media is supposed to be, but too often in Ireland no longer is. We are trying to change that, and we need your help. I am, therefore, asking for it, and would deeply appreciate a subscription at the level you can afford.
