Taylor\u00b7Sunday, June 8, 2025\u00b77 comments ViaKTLA\u2019s reporton the escalating tensions in Los Angeles, I noted the following. The unrest spread to downtown by Saturday evening, where protesters clashed with ICE agents outside the Federal Detention Center, where some detainees are believed to be held. Immigrant advocates, legal representatives andU.S. Rep. Jimmy Gomez (CA-34) attempted to enter the facilityto see those who had been detained during raids but said they were denied entry multiple times. Here is a thread from Representative Gomez from Friday. I won\u2019t include all of the tweets, but here are a couple worth noting. Overcrowding is so bad that women and children are being forced to sleep outside in tents. Meanwhile, the lights in the building shut off at 5pm. Families are sitting in pitch black. 4/8 According to attorneys on site, ICE claims it can detain people indefinitely even if they have a legal stay. That means: even if a court says they can\u2019t be deported, ICE keeps them locked up anyway. 6/8 This is reminiscent ofevents at an ICE detention facility in Newark, NJ,wherein two members of Congress attempted to inspect a facility and where Newark Mayor Baraka was arrested. Chargeswere later filedagainst US Representative LaMonica McIver (D-NJ). I am going to guess that ICE is not legally obligated to accommodate an impromptu inspection of their facilities. But I also suspect that there is no law that prohibits them from doing so. Indeed, it is pretty clear that ICE\u2019s leadership is choosing confrontation and intimidation of opposition legislators rather than cooperation and descalation. This fits the \u201cus versus them\u201d of the situation quite starkly, I would note. And for all the assertions that the people voted for all of this, there is a distinct lack of respect for others who also won office via the vote (the governor of CA, the mayor of LA, US Representatives, etc.). If conditions are acceptable, then the best and easiest way to quell concerns is to allow a courtesy inspection of the facilities. Denying access simply stokes fear and concerns. Here is a CBS News report (as linked from Rep. Gomez\u2019s tweet) from last week on conditions in Los Angeles:Immigrants at ICE check-ins detained, held in basement of federal building in Los Angeles, some overnight. One attorney, Lizbeth Mateo, said ICE officials slated several of her clients for check-ins at the Edward R. Roybal Federal Building in downtown L.A. but when they showed up on Tuesday, they were detained and immediately escorted to the basement. Mateo said a couple and their two children, one of whom is a U.S. citizen, spent the night in a room with no beds and limited access to food and water. Mateo said the father had previously been issued a stay of removal, barring him from deportation but he and his family were detained anyway. His wife was released Wednesday evening along with their children since she needed medical attention due to a high-risk pregnancy. He was still being detained early Friday, Mateo said. \u201cThis is something I\u2019ve never seen before,\u201d she added. \u201cUnder the first Trump administration, I represented clients with very difficult cases, but never anything like this. Under any other circumstance, he would have been released.\u201d It is clear that the Trump administration and people like Tom Homan and Stephen Miller do not see immigrants as human beings entitled to humane treatment and respect for their basic human rights. Instead, they are all lumped in as \u201cthe worst of the worst,\u201d or \u201cterrorists,\u201d or \u201ccriminals,\u201d or \u201cgang members.\u201d I would note that even criminal defendants have basic rights. But one of the hallmarks of \u201cus versus them\u201d is that people in the \u201cthem\u201d camp are not as important as those in the \u201cus\u201d camp. There have been multiple reports of late concerning ICE detentions. The state of California had already issued a report detailing concerns about the treatment of detainees. ViaCal Matters:California sent investigators to ICE facilities. They found more detainees, and health care gaps. Here\u2019s an NPR report concerning allegations of poor conditions a facility in Florida:In recorded calls, reports of overcrowding and lack of food at ICE detention centers. Here\u2019s one from Massachusetts via WBUR:ICE holding immigrants in \u2018abysmal\u2019 conditions at Burlington office building, lawyers say. Another from Texas viaThe El Paso Times:Amnesty International report finds disregard for human rights in El Paso ICE facility. From Kanas viaStraight Arrow News:Medical neglect, lockdowns and harsh conditions: Inside a Kansas ICE facility. **Comments** gVOR10says:Sunday, 8 June 2025 at 16:20I am going to guess that ICE is not legally obligated to accommodate an impromptu inspection of their facilities.Since the NJ incident I\u2019ve seen several statements that members of Congress by law do have the right to inspect any ICE facility unannounced.

Lawyers, or anyone else for that matter, are welcome to explain to the audience why I\u2019m wrong. This is another one of those cases where I would welcome being just nutha ignint cracker.
