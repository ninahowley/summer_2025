According to Indian River County Sheriff Eric Flowers, deputies attempted to stop a vehicle driving erratically just after sunrise. The driver refused to stop, leading deputies on a short pursuit that ended on 42nd Street. WATCH: 2 in custody after early-morning chase Indian River County Sheriff's Office (IRCSO) deputies arrested two individuals Tuesday morning after they had stolen a vehicle from a neighboring county. IRCSO deputies say they saw a vehicle driving recklessly in a residential area before fleeing from deputies down a dead-end road. The car then drove through a Florida East Coast (FEC) Railway fence. Two individuals were quickly taken into custody. One of them is a juvenile, the other was identified as 19-year-old Javonte Chambliss. \u201cThat guy is a known-history burglar,\u201d Sheriff Flowers said. WATCH: IRCSO body-cam footage of chase The vehicle was confirmed to be stolen from St. Lucie County with a stolen Indian River County tag. IRCSO said that this is not the first time these suspects have stolen a vehicle. Sheriff Flowers believes more suspects may have been inside the vehicle and says detectives are processing it for fingerprints and DNA. \u201cAt least two fled out of the vehicle. There may have been a third one,\u201d Flowers said. \u201cWe\u2019ll process the vehicle and find out who else was in it.\u201d The sheriff says his deputies may have stopped the group before they could commit additional crimes in the area.
