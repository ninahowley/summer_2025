The company offers a new way for architects, builders, designers, and landscape professionals to present 2-D plan drawings to their respective clients. WYP Des Moines utilizes state-of-the-art laser projection systems to provide unique interactive capabilities between building plans and the end user. The Grimes location is the first in Iowa. \u201cPre-construction in Iowa will never be the same,\u201d said James Machamer, Iowa Native and Co-Owner of Walk Your Plans Des Moines. \u201cAs someone who has worked in and around the construction industry, I firmly believe this will drastically change any pre-construction process.\u201d WYP Des Moines encourages anyone in the pre-construction phase of a project to plan with confidence and build with precision. Commercial and custom home builders can experience their floor plans to make changes before construction and reduce costly change orders. The new facility empowers stakeholders to experience plans in a new collaborative way. Walk Your Plans Des Moines is an expansive 7,000-square-foot facility. The space includes an office area featuring a welcoming lobby, a comfortable seating lounge, and a fully outfitted conference room. The remaining space is dedicated to our cutting-edge design studio, where clients can walk through their plans using our immersive projection system to visualize and perfect their floor plans before construction. The space will also be used for private events. James and Lorie Machamer are now open. James, a retired Navy Veteran with significant residential and commercial construction experience, pairs perfectly with Lorie\u2019s dynamic background in sales leadership and operations. The company has already built a healthy roster of industry partners in the Iowa homebuilding, commercial construction, architecture, interior design, and home renovation sectors. WYP Des Moines will have several open houses and ribbon cuttings in June, with the firstopen house June 13th, 4-6 pm. **Before You Leave, Check This Out** Jobs Terms of Service Privacy Policy Ad Choices EEO Public File Report FCC Online Public Inspection File Closed Caption Procedures Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information"}
