It is time to sayAu Revoirto the\u2018Forbidden Sketches\u2019, as we are about to cover the last few images left which were inspired by Jacques Vall\u00e9e\u2019sForbidden Science Vol. 6.I hope this silly little project of mine managed to entertain you, but above all I wish it encouraged you to grab a copy of Vall\u00e9e\u2019s wonderful memoirs, which are not only required reading for any serious student of ufology, but also a truly inspiring life lesson from a man who traveled far and wide through many sojourns\u2014some through the varied landscapes of our world, and others through landscapes of the imagination which allow you to get glimpses from theGreat Beyond. As for me, reading the Forbidden Science journals allowed me to get a glimpse of Vall\u00e9e as a man enamored with the passion for discovery, and the intelligence to appreciate the beauty in life, despite the many horrors he witnessed\u2014one Great War, the shadow of nuclear annihilation, Vietnam, 9/11 and the War on Terror, etc\u2014 and the personal sorrows he endured. This is greatly illustrated by his great love for classical music\u2014particularly what we would call \u2018sacred\u2019 or religiously inspired\u2014and his interest inmedieval stained glass art, which inspired him to learn it as a personal hobby with some of the great Masters which have preserved this ancient craft to this day. As he writes inFS Vol. 5: The aesthetic shock I feel whenever I look at Chartres has two powerful causes: sheer admiration and empathy for the achievement of the craftsmen who dedicated their lives to such marvels in the primitive conditions of a rugged era and, more importantly, the realization that the glass, interposed between man and the unknown, or rather the unknowable splendor of the sky, acts as a translator, a compiler of infinities, a mediator, a vector for the soul. Reading that passage, while keeping in mind Jacques\u2019s trajectory as a cybernetic scientist, made me realize that stained glass and a computer microchip arebasically made of the same material. And both technologies, though separated by centuries of technological development, are nonetheless connected by a common purpose ofstoring knowledge\u2014either by artistic symbolism, or the efficient 0s and 1s of our digital era. Not only that, but thanks to the work of Vall\u00e9e and his colleagues who developedArpanet(the precursor to the modern Internet) that knowledge can now be shared with the masses, just like the stained glass windows of the great European cathedrals were designed to transmit their message to all the visitors who made the pilgrimage inside these magical vectors oftransfigured light. Here in lies the often forgotten common link between Art and Science:Both are meant to transform humans from within\u2014and perhaps,thatis also the ultimate purpose behind the UFO mystery as well\u2026 But enough with the philosophical meanderings. You came here to see some funny pictures, so here they are. Oh, and remember the images are meant to represent my own personal opinion, and no one else\u2019s. Enjoy! Vall\u00e9e managed to end his journals on a positive note, and a heeding to those who will come after him:There is still time. Donotjust sit around waiting for\u2018Disclosure\u2019, when you could use what little precious time you have on this Earth searching for answers by yourself! Chances are you\u2019ll end up with evenmorequestions than when you first started; but if you do, then that meansyou did it right. **Forbidden Sketches: Hand-Drawn Artwork Inspired by the Published Journals of Jacques Vall\u00e9e (Vol. 6/Part 2)** **Not So (Go)Fast!
