The data includes passenger names, their full flight itineraries, and financial details. This article was created in partnership with404Media, a journalist-owned publication covering how technology impacts humans. For more stories like this,sign up here. CBP, a part of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), says it needs this data to support state and local police to track people of interest\u2019s air travel across the country, in a purchase that has alarmed civil liberties experts. The documents reveal for the first time in detail why at least one part of DHS purchased such information, and comes after Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)detailed its ownpurchase of the data. The documents also show for the first time that the data broker, called the Airlines Reporting Corporation (ARC), tells government agencies not to mention where it sourced the flight data from. \u201cThe big airlines\u2014through a shady data broker that they own called ARC\u2014are selling the government bulk access to Americans' sensitive information, revealing where they fly and the credit card they used,\u201d senator Ron Wyden said in a statement. ARC is owned and operated by at least eight major US airlines, otherpublicly released documents show. The company\u2019sboard of directorsinclude representatives from Delta, Southwest, United, American Airlines, Alaska Airlines, JetBlue, and European airlines Lufthansa and Air France, and Canada\u2019s Air Canada. More than240 airlines depend on ARCfor ticket settlement services. ARC\u2019s other lines of business include being the conduit between airlines and travel agencies,finding travel trendsin data with other firms like Expedia, and fraud prevention, according to material on ARC\u2019s YouTube channel and website. The sale of US fliers\u2019 travel information to the government is part of ARC\u2019s Travel Intelligence Program (TIP). AStatement of Work included in the newly obtained documents, which describes why an agency is buying a particular tool or capability, says CBP needs access to ARC\u2019s TIP product \u201cto support federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies to identify persons of interest\u2019s US domestic air travel ticketing information.\u201d 404 Media obtained the documents through a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request. The new documents obtained by 404 Media also show ARC asking CBP to \u201cnot publicly identify vendor, or its employees, individually or collectively, as the source of the Reports unless the Customer is compelled to do so by a valid court order or subpoena and gives ARC immediate notice of same.\u201d The Statement of Work says that TIP can show a person\u2019s paid intent to travel and tickets purchased through travel agencies in the US and its territories. The data from the Travel Intelligence Program (TIP) will provide \u201cvisibility on a subject\u2019s or person of interest\u2019s domestic air travel ticketing information as well as tickets acquired through travel agencies in the U.S. and its territories,\u201d the documents say. They add that this data will be \u201ccrucial\u201d in both administrative and criminal cases. ADHS Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) available onlinesays that TIP data is updated daily with the previous day\u2019s ticket sales, and contains more than one billion records spanning 39 months of past and future travel. The document says TIP can be searched by name, credit card, or airline, but ARC contains data from ARC-accredited travel agencies, such as Expedia, and not flights booked directly with an airline. \u201cIf the passenger buys a ticket directly from the airline, then the search done by ICE will not show up in an ARC report,\u201d that PIA says. The PIA notes that the data impacts both US and non-US persons, meaning it does include information on US citizens.

The CBP contract 404 Media obtained documents for was an $11,025 transaction. Last Tuesday, a public procurement database added a $6,847.50 update to that contract, which said it was exercising \u201cOption Year 1,\u201d meaning it was extending the contract. The documents are redacted but briefly mention CBP\u2019s OPR, or Office of Professional Responsibility, which inpart investigates corruption by CBP employees. \u201cCBP is committed to protecting individuals\u2019 privacy during the execution of its mission to protect the American people, safeguard our borders, and enhance the nation\u2019s economic prosperity. CBP follows a robust privacy policy as we protect the homeland through the air, land and maritime environments against illegal entry, illicit activity or other threats to national sovereignty and economic security,\u201d a CBP spokesperson said in a statement. CBP added that the data is only used when an OPR investigation is open, and the agency needs to locate someone related to that investigation. The agency says the data can act as a good starting point to identify a relevant flight record before then getting more information through legal processes. On May 1, ICE published details about its own ARC data purchase. In response, on May 2, 404 Media filed FOIA requests with ICE and a range of other agencies that 404 Media found had bought ARC\u2019s services, including CBP, the Secret Service, SEC, DEA, the Air Force, US Marshals Service, TSA, and ATF. 404 Media found these by searching US procurement databases. Around a week later,The Lever covered the ICE contract. Airlines contacted by 404 Media declined to comment, didn\u2019t respond, or deferred to either ARC or DHS instead. ARC declined to comment. The company previously told The Lever that TIP \u201cwas established after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks to provide certain data to law enforcement \u2026 for the purpose of national security matters\u201d and criminal investigations. \u201cARC has refused to answer oversight questions from Congress, so I have already contacted the major airlines that own ARC\u2014like Delta, American Airlines, and United\u2014to find out why they gave the green light to sell their customers' data to the government,\u201d Wyden\u2019s statement added. US law enforcement agencies have repeatedly turned to private companies to buy data rather than obtain it through legal processes such as search warrants or subpoenas. That includeslocation data harvested from smartphones,utility data, andinternet backbone data. \u201cOverall it strikes me as yet another alarming example of how the \u2018Big Data Surveillance Complex\u2019 is becoming the digital-age version of the military-industrial complex,\u201d Laperruque says, referring to the purchase of airline data. \u201cIt's clear the data broker loophole is pushing the government back towards a pernicious \u2018collect it all\u2019 mentality, gobbling up as much sensitive data as it can about all Americans by default. A decade ago the public rejected that approach, and Congress passed surveillance reform legislation that banned domestic bulk collection. Clearly it's time for Congress to step in again, and stop the data broker loophole from being used to circumvent that ban,\u201d he added.
