Following his uncle\u2019s advice, he ventured into agribusiness in 2021, focusing on cocoa, the key ingredient in chocolate, with bush mangoes, plantain, yam, and cocoyam on the side. His uncle, a university teacher, had introduced him to the wealth of opportunities in cocoa farming, particularly in their community of Bendeghe-Afi, 240 kilometres from the state capital Calabar, where rising cocoa prices have created millionaires and sustained many livelihoods. About 50 minutes from Afi Forest Reserve on a fast motorcycle, the community is 23 kilometres from Ikom, the state\u2019s cocoa trading hub, and home to major Licensed Buying Agents (LBAs) who serve as intermediaries between farmers and exporters. With cocoa prices soaring and formal employment scarce, nearly every family in Ikom and surrounding communities, such as Etta\u2019s and Abangku, now owns cocoa farms, even on small plots at their homes. Demand for land has surged, prompting locals to expand their farms to meet the increasing global demand for the crop and encroach on the Afi reserve, a protected forest critical for the fight against climate change. Villagers argue that these forests, handed to the government decades ago, have remained unused. \u201cEverybody is now in the forest reserve,\u201d said Bassey Foster, a forest ranger. He said he could not stop the farmers from using the forest land illegally. \u201cThe forest is not expanding, but the population is increasing. People need the forest to survive.\u201d Benjamin Takim, secretary of the Trackers\u2019 Union in Bendeghe-Afi and a motorcycle rider transporting cocoa, echoed this: \u201cPeople from Abangku farm in the Afi Reserve. Nobody gave them access; they encroached because the government abandoned the land. Now, they consider themselves the owners.\u201d **Nigerians need credible journalism.

When cocoa business is concerned, we don\u2019t joke with forest,\u201d Mr Takim said. In January, cocoa\u2019s off-season price ranged from N12,500 to N13,500 per kilogram, with a 100kg bag selling for N1,250,000 to N1,350,000. Prices are expected to rise further when the cocoa season begins in October. Retired civil servant-turned-cocoa farmer Takaim Ekori, confirmed this trend. **Join the Premium Times WhatsApp Community For Quick Access To News and Happenings Around You.** **Join the Premium Times WhatsApp Community For Quick Access To News and Happenings Around You.** The cocoa trade involves a structured supply chain: farmers harvest, dry the beans, and sell to LBAs through intermediaries. LBAs, who own warehouses, support farmers with logistics, training, high-yield varieties, and pesticides like Gammalin to control black pod disease. The LBAs in turn sell to exporters, including international suppliers, such as Olam, Tulip, and Cargill, among others, who then supply the global chocolate industry. The chocolate industry has long fueled deforestation due to the failure of the industry and its suppliers to monitor farmers \u2013 like those around Ikom \u2013 who are cutting down forests for cocoa plantations. This concern motivated the European Union to establish the European Union Deforestation Regulation (EUDR), which requires exporters to prove that cocoa and other primary products entering Europe are not sourced from deforested land or reserves. Originally set for January 2025, the regulation has been postponed by a year due to concerns from international stakeholders. Among Ikom\u2019s major cocoa exporters is Tulip Cocoa Processing Limited, a subsidiary of Amsterdam-based Theobroma, which has been trading cocoa butter since 1922. According to the Nigeria Export Promotion Council (NEPC), Tulip has expanded its grinding capacity from 12,000 to over 30,000 tonnes annually. Tulip, whose major export destination is the EU, did not respond to our email enquiry. Also, phone calls to the number on its official website did not go through. However, a senior official at the company said Tulip maintains a strict traceability system for its cocoa. \u201cWe have field officers, agronomists, and a traceability system in place. We don\u2019t buy cocoa from protected areas,\u201d the official said asking not to be named as they had no permission to talk to journalists. \u201cWe register farmers, track supply quantities, and provide training to discourage deforestation.\u201d However, community members dispute this claim. Farmers allegedly mix cocoa from both family-owned and reserve forests before selling to LBAs, who in turn sell to exporters like Tulip. The \u2018tracker\u2019 who transports the products from the farms confirmed this. \u201cI cannot count the number of bags we carry out of this place because sometimes some persons bring out two (2) tonnes in a year. That is 32 bags. A tonne is 16 bags. So there\u2019s no way we can keep records of the total bags that are being taken out from the forest in a season,\u201d Mr Benjamin said. \u201cMy normal load is two bags of two 200kg bags; that is 400kg at once and I can do that like 10 times in a day during the season. My members are many and depends on where you have your contract for the day.\u201d This was corroborated by Mr Foster, the ranger, saying: \u201cEverybody is now in the forest reserve. Tulip and Olams, all of them give LBAs money to farmers to buy and supply cocoa. All these Goddy Ukwu, and all of them, they buy these cocoa and supply to them. Anywhere there is cocoa, nobody wants to know where you get them from. What they want is cocoa. Will cocoa tell you I\u2019m from the forest?\u201d Godwin Ukwu, the owner of Goddy Ukwu warehouse, a prominent LBA in Ikom and the National General Secretary of theCocoa Association of Nigeria(CAN), explained that the company indeed has a sound tracing system. Notwithstanding, Mr Ukwu, a major supplier to Tulip, admitted that about 20 per cent of cocoa from untraceable sources finds its way to the exporters. \u201cHere in Cross River State, we\u2019ve been informed of this (EU regulation) for a very long time. And I think we are working, not only in Cross River but across Nigeria. We are working tirelessly to make sure that the reserve areas are not being encroached. **READ ALSO:Cocoa farmers count gains as cocoa bean prices soar** \u201cThe cocoa we do now, that we sell, majority, about 80 percent of the cocoa are traceable cocoa in the sense that, even if we go to my warehouse now before we load and if you ask my traceable manager downstairs, we have the document of every cocoa in the store, who supplied what and where the cocoa came from,\u201d Mr Ukwu said. Mr Ukwu advocates legislation to de-reserve some reserve areas because cocoa from the areas cannot be traced \u201cbecause they belong to an area that is not acceptable by the EU law.\u201d \u201cWhat we are trying to do now is to go back to the Cross Rivers State House of Assembly that those areas that were already planted before this law came on board, we should de-reserve them. Once we de-reserve them, they fit into the acceptable areas,\u201d he said. \u201cThe company we work with presently is Tulip Cocoa Processing and you know that they are good at record-keeping. So, the truth is, what we do now is that whichever cocoa leaves our warehouse, it gets to Tullip in Ijebu Mushin; they scan it, and they know the farmer the cocoa is coming from because they have gone around to register the farmers using the GPS Coordinate to check all the farms and you know that if you use the GPS coordinates to check your farms and plot it, if it is a reserved area they will know. If it\u2019s a reserved area, it would come out. Some of them used to be,\u201d he said. Mr Ukwu argued that some farms were in reserve areas before the EU regulation but his association is making moves in Cross River State to de-reserve those farms. \u201cWhat is the EU saying, should we cut down the stems and replant trees? So, what we\u2019re trying to do is to go back to the state House of Assembly to ask that some areas, some reserves should be de-reserved.\u201d He argued that cocoa trees contribute to carbon absorption. \u201cI don\u2019t see why planting cocoa should be an issue when it serves the same purpose as trees in the forest. Of course, forests provide greater ecosystem benefits, but cocoa trees also add value.\u201d When asked about the 20 per cent untraceable cocoa, Mr Ukwu suggested redirecting it to non-EU markets. \u201cThe EU regulation isn\u2019t global. Asia and other markets still buy cocoa. If Europe won\u2019t take it, we\u2019ll find other buyers before this becomes a global issue.\u201d Speaking on behalf of George Obenechi, the chairman of the Cross River State Forestry Commission, the commission\u2019s Director of Operations, Ibiang Essien, confirmed that the Afi forest in Ikom local government area is a government reserve. **READ ALSO:Cocoa farmers count gains as cocoa bean prices soar** While admitting that some villagers have indeed encroached into the forest to farm cocoa, he disclosed that measures were being put in place to sanction such farmers through mobile courts to be set up by the state government. The director said the agitation by some communities to de-reserve certain portions of the forests will be considered by the commission. \u201cAs the population is growing higher, there is bound to be a need for land to farm. But then, due process must be followed to ensure that the right thing is done. \u201cWe are the custodian, we are aware of population explosion, meaning that the quest for land will come on board. Anytime they come up with demand for a particular area, we will know what to do,\u201d he said. Nigeria is a major cocoa exporter, though it ranks behind Ghana and Ivory Coast, with the EU being its largest market. Concerns have thus increased regarding the impact on Nigeria\u2019s cocoa, a top non-oil export, if the EUDR is enforced, as the West African nation seeks solutions for its cocoa sourced from forests.
