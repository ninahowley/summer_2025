The MARC will be a central location for local and state agencies as well as human service organizations to answer resident\u2019s questions and provide information they need to navigate disaster-related issues. Although the water lines have receded and rivers are back to near normal levels, those who were in the thick of the worst of the flooding levels could still be struggling. Some insurance companies won\u2019t cover certain costs while some folk are left with nothing in their home due to water damage. \u201cThat\u2019s what makes flooding hard too, in order to identify who needs help in order for the other members of the community to realize there are people who are still struggling,\u201d said Butler County Emergency Management Director Keri Korthals. \u201cWith a tornado, once that storm rolls through you can just see the homes that are leveled and the debris everywhere. It\u2019s just so much more evident that a disaster has happened, there are people are in impact and are in need.\u201d Korthals said that while El Dorado residents took the heaviest hit the flood repercussions due to close vicinity of the river, Augusta city residents were fortunate to have the levee system in place. That doesn\u2019t exclude rural residents outside of city limits from flood damage, though. Some residents were near rivers that have lost fence lines \u201cWe really had a two-pronged issue with these storms that came through,\u201d said Korthals. \u201cThe day of the storms we had people experiencing very severe flash-flooding. So all those people subjected to that rapidly rising flash flooding but we also had those people who experienced river flooding.\u201d She estimates that out all the areas the damage assessors from county and city officials have surveyed, 208 properties were reported to have damage. That number includes a small portion of businesses. The damage reported ranges from minor or cosmetic destruction to major damages. \u201cWhen you have a flood, as long as the water\u2019s up, you definitely have that perspective of how bad it is,\u201d said Korthals. \u201cBut as soon as the water goes down, unless you\u2019re looking closely for water and debris lines, it may appear that the community has returned to dry and normal again while you could have someone who\u2019s basically lost the entire contents of their home.\u201d The resource center will be open to all Butler County residents who have experienced issues due to the flooding that happened across the county. The MARC will open Tuesday, June 10 at 2pm and run through Thursday at the Butler County Community Building located at 200 N Griffith. The operating hours will be: Tuesday, June 10th from 2pm-8pm Wednesday, June 11th from 2pm-8pm Thursday morning, June 12th, from 9am-2pm Among the resources that will be present include local and state agencies, non-profits, faith-based organizations, disaster relief organizations, insurance advice, mental health support, clean-up efforts, recovery, and more. The Butler County Health Department will be available for resources in addition to offering free tetanus shots for those who would like one but missed the clinics on Friday. Residents attending the MARC only need to bring proof of address and identification.
