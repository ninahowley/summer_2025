the Situation in Palestine Side Event at the ICC\u2019s 23rd Session of the Assembly of States Parties, The Hague 6th December 2024 || at 13:15 \u2013 14:15 local time || World Forum,Oceania room,The Hague Sponsored by:State of Palestine, and Republic of Colombia. Organised by:The Independent Commission for Human Rights-Palestine,Law for Palestine. The situation in Palestine remains one of the most formidable challenges in the history of the International Criminal Court (ICC). It is marked by an unprecedented scale of atrocities that shock the conscience of humanity, includingwell-documentedwar crimes, crimes against humanity, and evengenocide. Since June 2014, the period under the Court\u2019s jurisdiction, these grave violations have been met with pervasive impunity. However, on 21 November 2024, the Pre-Trial Chamber took a historic and decisive step by rejecting Israeli objections to the Court\u2019s jurisdiction and issuing arrest warrants in the Situation in the State of Palestine, six months after the Prosecutor\u2019srequestin May 2024. This landmark decision represents a significant advancement on the long road towards justice and accountability. This critical step, however, has been taken in the face of mountingpolitical pressure and threatsdirected at theProsecutorand the Court itself, aimed at obstructing the issuance of arrest warrants so desperately sought by victims. These threats have only intensified following the Pre-Trial Chamber\u2019s decision to issue the warrants. The current session of the Assembly of States Parties (ASP) presents a crucial opportunity to demonstrate solidarity with victims by amplifying their calls for justice and to support the Court in upholding its mandate with integrity and impartiality. The ICC embodies a legacy built upon the enduring pain of countless victims worldwide, serving as a beacon for humanity and ensuring accountability, irrespective of who the perpetrators are. Given these pressures and the ICC\u2019s lack of an enforcement mechanism beyond the compliance of States Parties to the Rome Statute, it is imperative that States ensure the Court\u2019s orders are respected and its mandate to end impunity is robustly supported. Beyond their legal obligations to cooperate with the ICC, States Parties need to provideemphatic political and diplomatic backingand adopt measures that extend beyond the arrest of suspects upon entry into their territories. Such measures includeidentifying potential leverageto ensure the continued visibility of the warrants on the agenda of all relevant fora and facilitating the timelyprovision of information. The arrest warrants also demand that States assess their international obligations, including ensuring that their actions -such as arms transfers- do not contribute to the commission of crimes identified by the Court. The Pre-Trial Chamber has alsonotedthat conduct similar to the crimes listed in the arrest warrants \u201cappears to be ongoing.\u201d Concurrently, the Office of the Prosecutor hasindicatedthat additional lines of inquiry are being pursued in light of \u201creports of escalating violence, further shrinking humanitarian access, and continued expansion of allegations of international crimes in Gaza and the West Bank.\u201d This vital side event, hosted by States Parties and human rights organisations, will bring together distinguished experts, legal professionals, and victims\u2019 representatives to address these pressing issues. The event will amplify the urgent appeals for justice from victims in Palestine, examine the challenges confronting the Court in this situation, and discuss the essential steps ASP Member States must take to secure accountability and strengthen the ICC\u2019s capacity to respond decisively to grave violations of international law.
