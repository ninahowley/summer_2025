For decades, Circolo Abruzzese has created opportunities to discover and reminisce their members\u2019 roots in Abruzzo, which is often culturally considered as part of Southern Italy. Rooted in a desire to build strong intergenerational connections, the organization has hosted Christmas parties, summer picnics and mother day\u2019s celebrations. \u201cI remember growing up [and] going to these events and playing with my cousins and meeting friends,\u201d recalls Federico. \u201cI want to have that for my children. It just helps maintain our heritage.\u201d In 1966, the organization \u2013 then known as \u2018Abruzzese of Vancouver\u2019 \u2013 was officially formed at the suggestion of Father Luigi Falone, an Abruzzese missionary vacationing in Vancouver. Prior to its formalization, Circolo Abruzzese was a simple gathering for a few Abruzzese immigrants in Vancouver seeking connection. \u201cIt started off as a social club, back in the 60s\u2026for my dad and his friends just to stay in touch with his friends andpaisani(fellow Abruzzese),\u201d recalls Federico. \u201cMy inspiration is giving back to my parents and showing that I want to continue their legacy.\u201d Since its founding, the volunteer-supported organization has been active in the Lower Mainland to champion Abruzzese culture. Their work focuses on transmitting the culture\u2019s values of resilience and togetherness. \u201cIt\u2019s like being away from Vancouver and meeting someone who is from Vancouver\u2026 and that feeling of being connected, like they are your neighbour\u2026.\u201d says Federico, explaining the significance of cultural connections. \u201cAnd then, you\u2019re raising children and when you have the same values, it just makes things easier.\u201d The organization\u2019s dual focus on cultural preservation and community support has been at the heart their work since its founding in the 1960s. They will celebrateFesta Della Repubblica(Republic Day) on June 2. Organized by Il Centro Italian Cultural Centre, the event marks an Italian national holiday commemorating the 1946 referendum that saw Italy\u2019s transition from a monarchy to a republic. \u201cWe don\u2019t actually host theFesta Della Repubblica; we just attend as a vendor,\u201d Federico adds. \u201cWe go and we cook, we bake traditional cookies, and we give them away after the ceremony.\u201d The ceremony will discuss Italian heritage, and the Centre plans to serve traditional Italian food, including pasta and risotto. The celebrations will continue June 8 at Italian Day on the Drive, an annual event featuring various communities of Vancouver\u2019s Italian diaspora. Participants can look forward to diverse food, live music, fashion and family-friendly fun, including a pasta-eating contest and life-sized human foosball. Circolo Abruzzese will be among the many vendors enlivening the 15th edition of the festival, serving grilled Italian sausages andarrosticini(lamb skewers). The organization will also host a raffle for attendees to win a soccer jersey signed by Lorenzo Insigne, who represented Italy in the 2014 FIFA World Cup and the UEFA European Championships in 2016 and 2020. \u201cWe can get stuck working for [our] nine to five job every day, and [the] years will fly by,\u201d Federico reflects. \u201cBut when you make it a point to show up once a month, show up to a picnic and set up the event, and thousands of people come to your booth to buy a sausage and are engaged; it makes you feel good.\u201d To end the month of celebration, the Society is hosting an Abruzzese-style dinner (June 20), this time, for a combined celebration of Mother\u2019s and Father\u2019s Day. The dinner will be hosted at Trattoria on 3075 Slocan Street and welcomes members and non-members alike to celebrate family over an intimate meal. Circolo Abruzzese\u2019s almost 60 years of engagement serve a purpose beyond social gatherings: they also reflect an enduring identity and values that have survived both time and distance. True to their vision of community, Circolo Abruzzese frequently collects funds in support of Vancouver-based charities, such as Canuck Place and Children\u2019s Variety Club. \u201cI want to grow the club so that my kids see how connected we are and how we can help volunteer and donate,\u201d says Federico. The organization also awardsan annual scholarship for post-secondary students in B.C. with Abruzzese roots. Federico hopes to connect the organization with other similar groups and foster an environment for promoting Italians in business. They will host their annual picnic later in the summer at Burnaby\u2019s Confederation Park. \u201cWe have games for kids, and we host a mini-soccer tournament for kids,\u201d he shares. \u201cWe also do an alumni soccer game for the older guys, we do giveaways. A portion of the money we raise are donated to various charities that the club members vote on.\u201d Leveraging his background in digital marketing, the vice-president also plans to lean into technology, building new partnerships and drawing in a new generation to champion Abruzzese culture in Vancouver. \u201cI also want to support local businesses and grow the club with more active, younger members,\u201d says Federico. \u201cOur seniors are getting older, and they can\u2019t do the things that they could do before.\u201d For more information on Circolo Abruzzese of Vancouver, seewww.circoloabruzzese.ca/events For details on Italian Day on the Drive, seewww.italianday.ca **Content to Discover** **A Kitsilano tradition: Greek Day returns to Broadway with food, music and fun** **A Kitsilano tradition: Greek Day returns to Broadway with food, music and fun** **Circolo Abruzzese celebrates Italian Heritage Month - Preserving cultural identity across generations** **Circolo Abruzzese celebrates Italian Heritage Month - Preserving cultural identity across generations** **Calling for a better Canada MOSAIC\u2019s passion for immigration positivity** **Calling for a better Canada MOSAIC\u2019s passion for immigration positivity** **Art for the community: Co.
