Great Trade Hack: How Trump's trade war fails and global trade moves on** Richard Baldwin The Great Trade Hack by Richard Baldwin explains how Trump\u2019s 2025 tariff blitz wasn\u2019t economic strategy. It was grievance politics. Tariffs, Baldwin shows, are political placebos that won\u2019t fix the U.S. economy but could fracture the global trade system. Blending sharp analysis with policy insight, he maps out three futures for world trade and urges global leaders to defend the rules by following them. The system can survive even thrive if world leaders step up.
