Questions Questions Background Background Entire Page Entire Page Just Article Just Article Just Questions Just Questions (by Samuel Chamberlain, NY Post) \u2013 President Trump cannot use theAlien Enemies Actto quickly deport a group of suspected Venezuelan gang members currently being held in Texas, the Supreme Court ruled Friday. In anunsigned order, the justices ruled that the South Americans should remain in the US while lower courts decide how far in advance migrants must be informed of their removal. Friday\u2019s ruling follows an April 19 order that also blocked quick deportations under the Alien Enemies Act, invoked by the administration earlier this year. \u201cWe did not on April 19 \u2014 and do not now \u2014 address the underlying merits of the parties\u2019 claims regarding the legality of removals under the AEA [Alien Enemies Act],\u201d themajority opinionread, noting at the very end that the government could still deport the migrants \u201cunder other lawful authorities.\u201d However, those removals would typically require notice and a chance to challenge their deportation in court.

(I certainly hope that it has not.),\u201d Alito wrote. \u201cBut if it has done so, today\u2019s order is doubly extraordinary. Grantingcertioraribefore a court of appeals has entered a judgment is a sharp departure from usual practice, but here neither the Court of Appeals nor the District Court has decided any merits questions.\u201d \u201cThe circumstances call for a prompt and final resolution, which likely can be provided only by this Court,\u201d Kavanaugh warned. \u201cAt this juncture, I would prefer not to remand to the lower courts and further put off this Court\u2019s final resolution of the critical legal issues. Rather, consistent with the Executive Branch\u2019s request forexpedition [speed]\u2014and as the detainees themselves urge\u2014I would grantcertiorari, order prompt briefing, hold oral argument soon thereafter, and then resolve the legal issues.\u201d This is a developing story.

Which two justices dissented from the majority order on the use of the Alien Enemies Act? 6. a) What did Justice Kavanaugh note in a concurring opinion about what he would like the court to do?b) Do you agree with Justice Kavanaugh? Explain your answer. 7. President Biden opened the borders and allowed (in some cases flew in on commercial airliners) close to 10 million illegal migrants (or more) into the U.S. How long do you think it would take the courts under the usual method of deportation (being granted a court hearing) to deport this number of people? 8. If a known gang member enters our country illegally, authorities have no legal right to deport them immediately. What do you think? Should known criminal gang members be granted a court hearing, or be immediately deported upon apprehension under the Alien Enemies Act? Explain your answer. 9. From a May 16 X post by Georgetown Law professor Jonathan Turley: The Supreme Court delivered a blow to the Trump Administration in blocking deportations under the Alien Enemies Act. However, the Court only did so based on the lack of notice (24 hours) afforded by the Administration. It did not rule on the legality of the use of the [Alien Enemies Act]. The Court expressly stated: \u201cTo be clear, we decide today only that the detainees are entitled to more notice than was given on April 18.\u201d That still leaves much to be decided including what notice is required: \u201cit is not optimal for this Court, far removed from the circumstances on the ground, to determine in the first instance the precise process necessary to satisfy the Constitution in this case. We remand the case to the Fifth Circuit for that purpose.\u201d Both the legality of using the act and the required notice remain undecided (beyond the fact that 24 hours is clearly not enough). The court is pumping the brakes as a warning to the Administration that it must give these individuals and the courts more time to consider these issues. And some reader responses to Mr. Turley: \u201cGreat job kicking the can until next time. The US isn\u2019t a sovereign country if they must ignore tens of millions of unvetted foreigners streaming into the country illegally, but has no means to get them out. This isn\u2019t hard. It is a pass by a [Supreme Court] unwilling to do their job.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s patently ABSURD for the courts to protect foreign criminals and \u201cgive notice\u201d to foreign nationals who entered the country without any kind of process or permission. They are just creating an expensive red tape quagmire on the taxpayers\u2019 dime. With a country 36 trillion in debt, you would think the courts would mind the expense! I think that it is time for Congress to reign in Judicial micromanagement of the Executive, especially when some justices apply double standards to various administrations.\u201d What do you think? Do you agree with one, both or neither of the reader responses to Mr. Turley\u2019s post on X? Explain your answer. **Background** The Alien Enemies Act of 1798: On the campaign trail prior to the election, Trump pledged to \u201cinvoke the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to target and dismantle every migrant criminal network operating on American soil.\u201d \u2026It is a sweeping law that, when invoked, grants the president extraordinary power. In his inaugural address on Jan. 20, President Trump said, \u201cI will direct our government to use the full and immense power of federal and state law enforcement to eliminate the presence of all foreign gangs and criminal networks bringing devastating crime to U.S. soil.\u201d On his first day in office, Trump signed 10 border-related executive actions, including anexecutive orderthat states that the president may invoke the Alien Enemies Act to stop \u201cany invasion or predatory incursion against the territory of the United States by a qualifying actor.\u201d The Alien Enemies Act permits the government to detain and expel without a hearing most citizens of a nation deemed a threat to U.S. security, based solely on their country of birth or citizenship. The President\u2019s order says violence stemming from drug cartels and transnational gangs \u2014 such as the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua\u2014threatens U.S. security. It states that in certain portions of Mexico, cartels \u201cfunction as quasi-governmental entities, controlling nearly all aspects of society.\u201d From a user post on X: The Alien Enemies Act does not require notification: \u201cThe Alien Enemies Act of 1798 (50 U.S.C. \u00a7 21-24) does not explicitly require notification to individuals being deported under its provisions. The Act grants the President broad authority to detain, relocate, or deport \u201call natives, citizens, denizens, or subjects\u201d of a hostile nation or government during a declared war or when there is a credible threat of invasion or predatory incursion. The language focuses on executive action \u2014 such as apprehension, restraint, or removal \u2014 without mandating specific procedural requirements like formal notification to those targeted.\u201d Daily \u201cAnswers\u201d emails are provided for Daily News Articles, Tuesday\u2019s World Events and Friday\u2019s News Quiz.
