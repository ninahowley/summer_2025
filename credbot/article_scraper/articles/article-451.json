What to consider when choosing a beginner brokerage accountChoosing the right brokerage account is a crucial first step in your investing journey. There are five main factors to evaluate when selecting a beginner-friendly account. Below, we'll break down each factor and explain what to look for, followed by insights into how the brokerages on our list measure up.As you compare options, keep in mind how well a brokerage aligns with your long-term financial goals and whether it can grow with you as you gain experience.1. Trust and brand recognitionThe most important factor when choosing a brokerage is trust. After all, no amount of savings on fees matters if your money isn't in a secure and reliable place. Every brokerage on our list has been thoroughly vetted and is SIPC insured, providing coverage for up to $500,000.When assessing trustworthiness, consider brands you already know -- especially if you bank with them, as they may offer seamless integration. If in-person assistance is important to you, focus on brokerages with physical branches.2. Platform usabilityThe platform's usability can make or break your experience. A well-designed platform should be intuitive, modern, and easy to navigate -- especially for beginners. While some platforms are sleek and app-focused (e.g., Robinhood), others cater more to desktop users.Consider how you'll primarily interact with your account. For instance, while I use my brokerage's app to monitor my investments, I prefer the desktop version for executing trades. If you're a beginner, features like customizable charts, trade simulators, or advisory tools can be invaluable in helping you learn and make informed decisions.3. FeesThe best beginner brokerages prioritize affordability by eliminating trading fees and monthly account fees. It's 2025 -- you shouldn't have to pay just to let your money work for you.One standout feature to look for is fractional share trading, which allows you to invest with small amounts of money. This flexibility is especially helpful for beginners, enabling you to invest in high-value stocks without needing to buy full shares.4. Investment optionsDiverse investment options are essential, particularly for beginners. Ensure the brokerage supports stock trades and mutual funds or ETFs, as these are the most common starting points for new investors.Looking ahead, consider whether the account can accommodate your evolving strategies. Does it support more advanced features like options trading? Can you open specialized accounts, such as IRAs or custodial accounts, as your needs grow? A scalable platform will save you the hassle of switching brokerages down the road.5. Educational resourcesFinally, prioritize brokerages with robust educational resources. Investing can be daunting, but access to tutorials, articles, and webinars directly within the platform can help you build confidence and skills faster.Look for platforms that offer beginner-friendly guides, explain financial concepts in plain language, and provide tools to simulate trades or practice strategies. A solid educational foundation will set you up for long-term success. **What to consider when choosing a beginner brokerage account** Choosing the right brokerage account is a crucial first step in your investing journey.

SoFi Active Investing Learn More SoFi Active Investing Learn More Our Rating: A clear standout with a modern experience. Beginners and long-term investors may find the most value, particularly those interested in stocks and ETFs, and in buying fractional shares.\u00b3 $0 for stocks, $0 for options contracts $0 Get up to $1,000 in stock when you open & fund a new Active Invest account. On SoFi Active Investing's Secure Website. SoFi\u00ae, widely known for its student loans and banking services, also offers a trustworthy and reliable brokerage account. If you're already a SoFi\u00ae banking customer, adding a brokerage account can simplify your financial management. However, keep in mind that SoFi\u00ae is an online-only platform, so its customer service experience is crucial. While phone support is unavailable on weekends, they make up for it with 24/7 chat support, which can be a lifesaver when you need quick assistance. SoFi\u00ae's platform is one of the simplest that we've found. While it lacks the advanced features of some competitors, its streamlined design makes it ideal for beginners who want a no-frills experience. If your primary focus is straightforward stock and ETF investing, SoFi\u00ae provides everything you need without unnecessary complexity. Here's what the mobile platform looks like: SoFi\u00ae has no commission fees for stocks or options, no account minimums, and no annual fees.\u00b9 This makes it an excellent choice for beginners who want to maximize their investments without worrying about commissions. That said, there are some fees to be aware of: a $25 inactivity fee per account for 12 months of login inactivity and a $100 fee for full or partial outgoing transfers. These charges are notably higher than what many other brokerages on this list impose, so consider whether these fees might impact your plans. SoFi\u00ae offers a well-rounded selection of investment options. You can choose between self-directed trading and automated robo-advising services. In addition to trading stocks and ETFs, SoFi\u00ae allows you to invest in IPOs at IPO prices -- an uncommon feature that sets it apart.\u00b2 Fractional share trading is also available, which is perfect for beginners looking to start small and diversify their portfolio without significant upfront costs.\u00b3 (See disclosures.) SoFi\u00ae shines in the educational department with its SoFi\u00ae Learn section, a comprehensive guide to financial literacy. This resource doesn't just cover investing basics -- it also provides insights into credit cards, insurance, budgeting, home buying, and more. As our pick for Best All-In-One Financial App, it offers far beyond investing. Another standout feature is access to financial planners, a fantastic benefit for beginners who may need personalized guidance.\u2076 These planners can help create a holistic financial plan that goes beyond investing, covering all aspects of your financial health. **Best app for ease of use: Robinhood** On Robinhood's Secure Website. Robinhood Learn More Robinhood Learn More Our Rating: Simple-to-use investing experience and commission-free trading make Robinhood one of the best stock brokers for beginner investors, and Robinhood delivers on all these fronts, and more. $0 for stocks, ETFs, and options $0 On Robinhood's Secure Website. Robinhoodrevolutionized the investing world by popularizing commission-free trading, attracting younger, tech-savvy investors with its intuitive and accessible app. However, the platform faced criticism in 2020 due to system outages during periods of market volatility and in 2021 for freezing trades on GameStop during the stock's highly publicized rally. Since then, Robinhood has worked to rebuild its reputation, addressing past issues and enhancing its platform. With over 10 million users now relying on Robinhood as their primary brokerage, it remains a popular choice for beginner investors seeking a straightforward entry point into the market. Robinhood is renowned for its simple, beginner-friendly app, which makes navigating and managing investments easy. In October 2024, the company introduced Robinhood Legend, a desktop platform designed for advanced traders. This addition gives users room to grow by offering access to enhanced charting tools, technical indicators, and other advanced features, while retaining the app's hallmark simplicity for beginners. This dual approach ensures that Robinhood accommodates both novice investors and those looking to expand their trading capabilities. Here's what the mobile platform looks like: Robinhood led the way in commission-free trading, making it an excellent platform for new investors who want to start trading without worrying about fees eating into their gains. There are no account minimums or annual fees, further cementing its reputation as an affordable option. There is a $100 fee to transfer from Robinhood to an outside brokerage. Robinhood focuses on the essentials, allowing users to invest in stocks and ETFs. Fractional share trading is a standout feature, enabling users to buy into high-value stocks for as little as $1. However, Robinhood's investment options are limited compared to some competitors. The platform does not offer mutual funds or many alternative investments. If these are important to your strategy, you might consider other brokers like Charles Schwab or Fidelity, which provide more diverse offerings. Robinhood offers an educational hub called Robinhood Learn, which provides accessible content on the basics of investing. This resource is great for beginners looking to build foundational knowledge. That said, Robinhood's in-app research tools are relatively basic unless you upgrade toRobinhood Gold, which provides access to advanced research and data. If deep analytical tools and comprehensive research options are a priority, other platforms may better meet your needs. **Best app with educational resources: E*TRADE from Morgan Stanley** On E*TRADE's Secure Website. E*TRADE from Morgan Stanley Learn More E*TRADE from Morgan Stanley Learn More Our Rating: E*TRADE manages to cater to active traders with one of the best stock trading platforms for beginners, while also appealing to long-term investors with thousands of mutual funds and ETFs that can be traded commission-free.

This partnership allows customers to access in-person support at Morgan Stanley bank locations, offering a level of service that's rare among online brokerages. Although E*TRADE from Morgan Stanley originated as a discount brokerage, it has significantly expanded its offerings. Whether you're looking for a Roth IRA, custodial account, or traditional brokerage account, E*TRADE from Morgan Stanley provides a wide array of account types. Additionally, you can bank through the platform, making it a versatile choice for managing multiple financial needs.

This dual-platform approach means E*TRADE from Morgan Stanley can grow with you as your investing skills develop. Here's what the mobile platform looks like: E*TRADE from Morgan Stanley is a strong contender in the low-fee brokerage category, offering commission-free trading for stocks and ETFs with no inactivity fees. However, there are costs associated with specific services, such as options contracts and broker-assisted trades. There's also a $75 transfer out fee if you want to move money to another brokerage. These fees are fairly standard in the industry, but worth considering if you plan to engage in more complex trading activities. E*TRADE from Morgan Stanley offers a comprehensive range of investment options, making it a versatile choice for investors of all levels. In addition to stocks and ETFs, it provides access to over 6,000 mutual funds and supports a wide variety of account types, including IRAs, rollovers, and robo-advisory accounts. One notable drawback is the lack of fractional share trading, which can be a barrier for beginners with limited funds. However, E*TRADE from Morgan Stanley does allow dividend reinvestment into fractional shares, which can help grow your portfolio over time. E*TRADE from Morgan Stanley's educational resources are robust and varied. Its online library covers a broad range of topics, from investing basics to advanced strategies.

Just like a savvy captain adjusts course based on weather patterns, every investor needs a strategy to handle the inevitable risks and steer their portfolio toward long-term success. Luckily, that's where we at The Motley Fool thrive. **Risk assessment: Understanding your tolerance** Before youstart investing, it\u2019s important to take a moment and reflect on your own risk tolerance. Are you cool with the market's rollercoaster ride, or do the smallest drops leave you in a cold sweat? Conservative: These investors prefer to play it safe, favoring low-risk options like bonds and stable, dividend-paying stocks. Moderate: Looking for balance, moderate investors split their assets between stocks, bonds, and other investments for steady, long-term growth. Aggressive: Ready to go big, aggressive investors focus on higher-risk, high-reward opportunities, like tech stocks and small-cap companies, hoping for bigger returns. **Building a diversified portfolio: Don\u2019t put all your eggs in one basket** Smart investors don\u2019t put all their eggs in one basket -- and neither should you.Diversificationis key to weathering market storms, so spread your investments across different assets, sectors, and regions. Asset allocation: This is the core of diversification. It\u2019s about balancing your stocks, bonds, real estate, and other assets to match your risk tolerance and investment goals. Sector diversification: Spreading your investments across different industries -- like tech, healthcare, and energy -- helps protect you from risks tied to any one sector. **The importance of rebalancing** Your financial situation -- and your risk tolerance -- might shift over time. That\u2019s why regularly rebalancing your portfolio is crucial. It ensures that you stay on track to meet your investment goals while keeping the risk at the level you\u2019re comfortable with. **A note of caution** While diversification is a smart strategy, it\u2019s not a magic bullet. Even the best-diversified portfolios can take a hit in a market downturn. Just remember, it's all about balancing risk with reward and staying focused on the long-term horizon. By understanding your risk tolerance and building a diversified portfolio, you'll be better prepared to navigate the unpredictable waters of the stock market and reach your financial goals -- come rain or shine.
