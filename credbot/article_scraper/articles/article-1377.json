Some words may be mispronounced. DES MOINES \u2014 Calling for a new generation of political leaders \u2014 including new leadership for U.S. Senate Democrats \u2014 and saying national politicians in both parties \u201chave been screwing over Iowa families for too long,\u201d Iowa Democrat and state legislator Zach Wahls on Wednesday announced his candidacy for the U.S. Senate. Wahls, a 33-year-old state senator from Coralville, in an interview ahead of Wednesday\u2019s announcement said Iowans need someone who will have \u201cthe courage to stand up to the establishment to fight for us.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve spent my entire career doing exactly that: standing up to powerful interests and insiders when it\u2019s hard, delivering real results for Iowans and demonstrating that Iowa Democrats believe in hard work and not handouts for billionaires,\u201d Wahls said. Iowa\u2019s 2026 U.S. Senate election is for the seat held since 2015 by Republican U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst. Ernst has not yet declared whether she plans to run for re-election, although her campaignhired a campaign manager earlier this month. Wahls is the third Iowa Democrat to announce his candidacy for the state\u2019s U.S. Senate election, joining fellowstate legislator J.D. Scholtenof Sioux City andchamber of commerce leader Nathan Sageof Indianola. Wahls said he believes Iowa voters of all political ideologies are ready for change. \u201cI think it\u2019s time for a new generation of leaders who are focused on solving the problems that we are going to be facing today and tomorrow, and not rehashing the battles of the past,\u201d Wahls said. \u201cI think that (Iowans) are more interested in leaders who will roll up their sleeves and do the hard work of solving problems, rather than just engaging in political posturing and point-scoring in Washington and in Iowa.\u201d That new generation of leaders should include new leadership in the U.S. Senate Democratic caucus, Wahls said. New York U.S. Sen. Chuck Schumer has led U.S. Senate Democrats since 2017. When asked, Wahls said if elected to the U.S. Senate he would vote for a new Democratic leader. \u201cAbsolutely. It\u2019s time for new generation of leaders,\u201d Wahls said. Wahls experienced a leadership change of his own when, in 2023, Iowa Senate Democratsvoted to remove Wahls as their caucus leaderand install Sen. Pam Jochum, of Dubuque, who has since retired. At the time,Wahls claimedhe was voted out as leader after he fired two longtime Senate Democrat staffers who, Wahls said, did not share his vision for the caucus. Wahls said at the time that Iowa Democrats \u201cdesperately need a new direction and leaders who will chart that course.\u201d He has similar thoughts now about the direction of the country. \u201cI\u2019ve stood up to my own party before. I\u2019ve got the scars to show for it,\u201d Wahls said during his campaign announcement interview. \u201cMaking change is hard, and that\u2019s exactly why it\u2019s so important. \u201cLook, I\u2019m a Democrat because I believe that since the New Deal, our party has stood for economic security and civil rights. That\u2019s the core of what it means to be a Democrat. I think a lot of people in our party are frustrated by leaders in our party because they don\u2019t see leaders who can effectively deliver on those two commitments,\u201d Wahls added. \u201cAnd I think there is a lot of excitement about a new generation of leaders stepping forward and saying we have a new vision for how our party can win elections, can govern and can solve the problems that are facing Iowa families.\u201d Wahls was first elected to the Iowa Senate in 2018. He represented a district that included Coralville and western Johnson County, and all of Cedar County. After decennial redistricting in 2021, Wahls\u2019 district changed to include Coralville, North Liberty and western Johnson County. Wahls is cofounder of Wahls Enterprise LLC, which he established for the customized \u201cWoman Cards\u201d playing cards that hecreated in 2016after then-candidate Donald Trump accused his 2016 presidential election opponent Hillary Clinton of playing \u201cthe woman card.\u201d Wahls previously worked as vice president for community investment and development at GreenState Credit Union. Wahls first gained prominence in 2011 when, as a 19-year-old, hespoke on the Iowa House floorabout his two mothers as legislators debated a proposal to ban same-sex marriage in the state. **Campaign of community service** Wahls said he expects economic concerns to be the top issue in the 2026 election. He also highlighted health care issues \u2014 including Iowa\u2019s high cancer rates \u2014 education, and protecting Social Security. Wahls said he wants his U.S. Senate campaign to be one of community service. He pledged to campaign across the state and ask Iowans about the needs in their communities. \u201cOne of the things that I always loved growing up was that quote from President Kennedy who said, \u2018Ask not what your country can do for you. Ask what you can do for your country.\u2019 With this campaign, we\u2019re asking not what can Iowa do for this campaign. We\u2019re asking what can this campaign do for Iowa,\u201d Wahls said. \u201cSo we\u2019re looking for opportunities to provide community service along the way, to hear from people across the state about the problems in their communities and use whatever resources our campaign can find to address those problems,\u201d Wahls said. \u201cAnd if we can\u2019t address those problems during the campaign, that\u2019s going to be our to-do list in Washington. Our legislative agenda is going to be directly informed by the problems that we hear about as we campaign across the state.\u201d Another political quote that Wahls is drawing on as he launches his Senate campaign comes from Sam Rayburn, a Democratic U.S. House Speaker in the 1940s, who once said, \u201cAny jackass can kick down a barn, but it takes a good carpenter to build one.\u201d And Wahls said he will take the cue from longtime Iowa Republican U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley and campaign in all 99 of Iowa\u2019s counties. Wahls credited Grassley for \u201cgood constituent service and hearing from Iowans.\u201d \u201cAnd frankly, that is the same ethos that we want to bring to this campaign. Those are good, old fashioned Iowa values,\u201d Wahls said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be running a grassroots effort. I want to hear from Iowans. We\u2019re going to respond to Iowans. We\u2019re going to hear their problems. We\u2019re going to try to help solve their problems. And that\u2019s the approach that we\u2019re going to take in this campaign, and that is exactly how I will represent them in the United States Senate if they choose to elect me.\u201d The primary election in Iowa is scheduled for June 2, 2026. Wahls' current, four-year term in the Iowa Senate ends at the end of 2026, and state law prohibits Iowa legislators from holding multiple elected offices at the same time. **Republicans react** The Republican Party of Iowa and the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the campaign organization that works to elect Republicans to the U.S. Senate, both issued statements Wednesday addressing Wahls\u2019 campaign announcement. Both Republican statements referenced immigration and transgender athlete policies. In her statement, Republican Party of Iowa co-chair Linda Upmeyer, a former Iowa House Speaker, called Wahls \u201canother far-left, do-nothing Democrat.\u201d \u201cDuring his forgettable time in the Iowa Senate, Zach Wahls made a name for himself as an extreme liberal activist championing out-of-touch policies including high taxes, open borders, and letting biological men play in women\u2019s sports,\u201d Upmeyer said in the statement. \u201cBut above all else, he has always been more interested in chasing headlines than listening to Iowans.\u201d Comments: (515) 355-1300, erin.murphy@thegazette.com Get the latest Iowa politics and government coverage each morning in theOn Iowa Politics newsletter. **Erin Murphy** Des Moines Bureau chief, The Gazette Covering Iowa politics and government for The Gazette.
