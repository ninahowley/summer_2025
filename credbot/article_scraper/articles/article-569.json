Further, the removal of regulation on Site Directed Nuclease1 (SDN1) and SDN2 developed products in many countries has made it more revolutionary technology for adoption in crop improvement. Designing the accurate guide RNA (gRNA) is the initial and most crucial step which decides the success of the gene editing. Though, the gene editing technique is widely used in crops, a detailed method on comprehensive designing of efficient gRNA in wheat is still lacking. By virtue of wheat being a hexaploid crop and having a large genome size with repetitive DNA, a tailor made strategy for designing the gRNA is very much crucial.The manuscript explains the comprehensive strategies and methods for efficient gRNA designing by considering physical, structural and expression of the target gene in genome and explains on-target and off-target effects of gRNA for its precise editing through CRISPR/Cas9 mediated SDN1 method of genome editing in wheat.The present manuscript is first of its kind to address the holistic approach starting from efficient gene selection, gRNA designing and post gRNA designing issues like gRNA stability, binding efficiency, and functionality for SDN1-CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing in wheat. This manuscript will acts as a ready reference for wheat researcher for effective gRNA designing for wheat improvement to meet the future food demand.
