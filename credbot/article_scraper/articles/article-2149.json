An aide revealed that His Majesty plans to 'share a few salty tales' during the nostalgic gathering. The event brings together former shipmates and their partners from nine ships, where the King served during his naval career, including HMS Bronington, Jupiter, Norfolk, Hermione, Minerva, Hermes, Dryad, Fox, and Britannia Royal Naval College, Dartmouth. Also in attendance are fellow aviators from the 845 Naval Air Squadron and the Fleet Air Arm. In addition to his former colleagues, representatives from several naval organisations under the King's patronage will be present. These include members from HMY Britannia and representatives from The White Ensign Association, The Royal Navy Club of 1765 and 1785, The Royal Naval Benevolent Trust and the Association of Royal Naval Officers. An aide to The King toldGB News: 'His Majesty was greatly looking forward to seeing his old shipmates and no doubt sharing a few salty tales on the trip down memory sea-lane.' The aide added: 'He is most grateful for their continued loyalty, laughter and support over the decades, and looked forward to hearing where life's journeys had taken them all.' The reception also holds special significance as it comes close to the 50th anniversary of The King's Trust.
