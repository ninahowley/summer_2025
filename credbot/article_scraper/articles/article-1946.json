She\u2019s become a staple in so many homes since the COVID-19 pandemic and has seen major success helping kids learn basic skills and concepts. But despite her soft, friendly voice, Ms. Rachel isn\u2019t afraid to speak up for meaningful causes. She\u2019s been vocal about the ongoing war between Israel and Gaza, and she\u2019s found it particularly bothersome that some media outlets would rather report on things likeOlivia Munnnot letting her kids watch Ms. Rachel\u2019s videos instead of shedding light on the awareness the online personality is trying to raise about how the war is impacting innocent families. In fact, she\u2019s been calling out those outlets directly on social media. Here\u2019s what she had to say. **Ms. Rachel calls out outlets for not reporting on Gaza support.** At the beginning of June 2025,Parentsmagazine andPeoplemagazine both released issues featuring stories onOlivia Munn, wife ofJohn Mulaney, mom of two, and a breast cancer patient. Among the things revealed about Olivia is that she isn\u2019t exactly a fan of Ms. Rachel. Normally, that wouldn\u2019t be a big deal because every parent has the right to choose what shows their kids watch. But what rubbed Ms. Rachel the wrong way was how the magazines chose to highlight that detail, focusing on Olivia\u2019s dislike of her content rather than covering something more meaningful, perhaps her advocating for the kids in Gaza. A post shared by Parents (@parents) Parentsmagazine shared apost on Instagramwith the caption: \"Olivia Munn is revealing her true thoughts about kids\u2019 shows. Her take: Ms. Rachel is for littles, and not her kind of show.\" The promo photo even included a quote from Olivia of her essentially saying Ms. Rachel\u2019s shows \u201cdrive me crazy.\u201dPeoplemagazine took a similar approach, captioningtheir post: \"Ms. Rachel is for littles \u2014 but not Olivia Munn\u2019s,\" though it appears they have since updated it. It didn\u2019t take long for Ms. Rachel to jump into the comments on both posts, calling the outlets out directly and writing: \"I\u2019d rather you cover my advocacy for kids in Gaza.\" She latershared a screenshot of both postsand elaborated on what she hoped the coverage would focus on instead: \"I\u2019d rather you cover me advocating for kids in Gaza who are literally starving, largest cohort of child amputees in modern history, thousands and thousands killed \u2014 no medical care, no education, no homes \u2026 do better!!!\" A post shared by Ms Rachel (@msrachelforlittles) She also clarified that she isn\u2019t upset with Olivia for not playing her shows in her household, saying: \"[I] don\u2019t care that she doesn\u2019t want to watch the show \u2014 all my love to her and her family \u2014 disappointed in the outlets.\" **Why doesn\u2019t Olivia Munn let her kids watch Ms. Rachel?** It appears Olivia doesn\u2019t let her kids watch Ms. Rachel\u2019s shows simply because she\u2019s not a fan. During a recent interview withParentsmagazine, she explained, \"I know kids love [Ms. Rachel], but the thing is, if I can\u2019t watch it, I\u2019m not going to spend the rest of my life going crazy. These kids\u2019 shows drive me crazy.\" Since she doesn\u2019t find Ms. Rachel\u2019s content appealing, that alone is enough for her to keep it off the screen in her household.
