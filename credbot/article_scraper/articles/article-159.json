In a widely-circulated email, former member Colleen Burt discussed a police investigation and warned parents of potential AI-generated explicit images created of middle and high school girls. Responses quickly came from Dover Police and the Dover-Sherborn superintendent, who said the email contained information that was \u201cnot factual and could be misleading.\u201d Dover Police said a September investigation revealed male students had clothed photos of their female classmates, and one boy disseminated both the photos of students and \u201cadditional nude pictures of an unknown origin in these messages.\u201d Charges were brought in juvenile court, but McCoy said they were eventually dismissed. McCoy said Tuesday an independent investigator employed by the district after the incident has completed seven reports for each student involved, some 30 pages long, that have been shared with the families. The reports are also now being reviewed by the Title IX coordinator and \u201cdecision maker in the district\u201d she stated. Results of the review will be shared with the families, who may appeal the decision, McCoy said. Burt attended Tuesday\u2019s School Committee meeting and read off anonymous statements she said parents had asked her to share. These included accounts from the parent of an alum who was subject to sexual harassment and a second parent of an 8th grade student who was sent pornography over Snapchat in the spring, stating the district denied her Title IX complaint and \u201cappears to have doubled down on their stance of minimizing victims\u2019 experiences.\u201d A third anonymous statement came from the parent of one of the girls named as a victim in the photo-sharing police investigation in September, Burt read, and shared more allegations regarding the incident. \u201cTo brush this under the rug or turn a blind eye is not the solution,\u201d Burt read. \u201cWhat message are we sending to these boys, if there\u2019s no discipline for their actions? The message we are sending the victims and other females is that is okay, and boys can get away with it.\u201d School Committee Chair Angie Johnson raised concerns about sharing details of an investigation involving minor children, citing her history as a prosecutor. McCoy also stated district officials have not seen police reports from the incident. In the 2023-24 school year, Dover-Sherborn Public Schools reported a zero bullying allegations. The prior year, no information on the district\u2019s bullying allegations was included in state data. The district consists of the local middle and high school and just over 1,000 students. **Related Articles** As feds resume student loan collections, states try to catch borrowers before they sink How scammers are using AI to steal college financial aid Behind on student loan payments?
