(IPI) is a voter advocacy organization that promotes the implementation of ranked choice voting, the elimination of party-primary nomination elections, and the establishment of the Legislative Machinery Innovation Commission that would overhaul the current design of the legislative branch of the United States.12 Founded in 2021,3the IPI claims that the American political system suffers from \u201ctoxic levels of unhealthy competition\u201d4due to citizens not liking their voting choices and politicians not being incentivized to solve problems.4 IPI\u2019s founder and chair is Katherine Gehl, the former president and CEO of food manufacturing company Gehl Foods, which she sold in 2015.5 **Activities** The Institute for Political Innovation (IPI) claims that the American political system suffers from \u201ctoxic levels of unhealthy competition\u201d4due to citizens not liking their voting choices and politicians not being incentivized to solve problems. As a solution, IPI proposes a collective \u201cre-engineering\u201d of U.S. elections and lawmaking system through \u201cFinal-Five Voting\u201d and \u201cZero-Based Rule Making.\u201d4 **Final-Five Voting** Final-Five Voting would replace party-primary elections with a universal ballot including all primary candidates. All voters would be allowed to vote in the new primaries. It would also introduce ranked choice voting, where voters would rank candidates in order of most to least preferred. The victor would be decided by a tabulation of which candidate received a majority of the voters. It is called \u201cFinal-Five\u201d because the final ballots for the general election would have five different candidates to choose from, rather than two.1 **Zero-Based Rule Making** Zero-based rule making intends to replace \u201cthe bloated and outdated rules, practices, and norms of lawmaking\u201d with a \u201cmodern approach\u201d that would redesign the legislative branch at the local, state, and federal levels. It intends to remove many of the unwritten rules and norms in the House and Senate. It would start each budget period at \u201czero,\u201d analyze the needs and costs of each function and allocate the budget accordingly. It would also create the Legislative Machinery Innovation Commission, an \u201cindependent and nonpartisan\u201d entity that would redesign the current legislative branch of the United States. It would base its new design on the goal of making representatives \u201cmore accountable and responsive to our demands.\u201d2 **Finances** According to its 2023 990 form, the Institute for Political Innovation (IPI) reported a revenue of $2,001,573, expenses of $2,334,965, and total assets of $1,252,093.6 According to its 2022 990 form, the IPI reported a revenue of $3,168,294, expenses of $2,284,357, and total assets of $1,653,159.7 According to its 2021 990 form, the IPI listed its total revenue at $4,208,073, total expenses at $3,802,404, and total assets at $417,684.8That same year it received grants from several non-profits including the Christian Community Foundation of Memphis and the Mid-South Inc.9and theSchwab Charitable Fund.10The IPI also appears to have a sister 501(c)(4) organization, the IPI Action Fund, which is listed under the same address as IPI.11In 2021, the IPI Action Fund received a $500,000 grant from activist non-profit funding organizationPatriot Republicfor the purpose of \u201cstructural reform.\u201d12 **Leadership** Katherine Gehl is the founder and chairman of the Institute for Political Innovation (IPI).
