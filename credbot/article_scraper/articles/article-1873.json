The operation was part of what has been described as an investigation into a cartel run, transnational human trafficking and drug distribution network. Despite multiple efforts by Hennepin County Sheriff Dawanna Witt and others to get accurate information out as to the nature of the investigation, anti-ICE activists descended upon the scene of one of the search warrants on Lake Street in Minneapolis and violently interfered with investigators trying to do their jobs. One of the reasons the anti-ICE activists became so emboldened was theinaccurate messagescoming from people in political leadership positions who stoked the flames of those who believed, or wanted to believe, the operation was some type of ICE raid for illegal aliens. Those leaders quickly trotted out, and have stubbornly stuck to the narrative that ICE is evil and the ICE mission of enforcing our nation\u2019s immigration laws is \u201charmful.\u201d Leaders, including Governor Tim Walz, Attorney General Keith Ellison, Hennepin County Board Chair Irene Fernando, Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty, Minneapolis City Council members Jeremiah Ellison (the Attorney General\u2019s son) and Jason Chavez have made statements during and/or after the operation that each of them should know were wrong to make \u2014 calling it chaotic, militaristic, harmful, dangerous, and designed to \u201cillicit fear,\u201d etc. They have allowed themselves to be painted into a corner by activists on the issue of immigration enforcement, and as such, we should expect continued erroneous, ill-timed, and harmful messages coming from these leaders. What we should also expect is that not a single one is likely to show true leadership and walk back their statements or offer an apology \u2014 even in light of the most recent information. Late yesterday,reportsbegan surfacing that the eight search warrants executed last week came in response to the seizures of 900 pounds of methamphetamine in a Burnsville storage locker. Authorities valued the seizure at $25 million dollars. This seizure easily ranks among the biggest seizures of controlled substances in state history. By comparison, I took part in an investigation of Mexican methamphetamine trafficking in Minneapolis in the early 1990s. We intercepted the \u201cload car\u201d and recovered 7 pounds of methamphetamine secreted in the car\u2019s roof panels. At the time, the seizure was one of the biggest ever in the state, and was a major case prosecuted by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in federal court. The 900 pounds seized recently is mind-boggling and speaks to just how entrenched we have allowed cartel operations to get in our state. The eight search warrants that authorities executed last week were conducted at businesses and homes in Minneapolis, Bloomington, Inver Grove Heights, Burnsville, Lakeville and Northfield. \u201cRelevant evidence\u201d was seized at each location, including gold-plated guns and portraits of fictional character Tony Montana from \u201cScarface.\u201d Why is this important? Because it speaks to the scale of the operation and the resources available to the cartel under investigation. Those who can\u2019t understand just how dangerous such investigations can be, need to step aside. Their inability to grasp the threat that such a cartel organization represents to officers and agents involved in these investigations makes their work even more dangerous. One only needs to search forreportsof the many cartel shootouts with Mexican authorities to grasp that this is a whole different level of threat \u2014 one that mandates a strong show of force to prevent the same level of violence from occurring in Minneapolis. For any of the \u201cleaders,\u201d who have gone out of their way to criticize the federal law enforcement authorities by suggesting that last week\u2019s operation was \u201ctoo militarized\u201d or \u201ctone deaf\u201d as Minneapolis Police Chief O\u2019Hara stated, it represents examples of poor leadership, and requires a retraction and an apology. Apparently, the agents, knowing what they were potentially up against, were supposed to call ahead to multiple Minneapolis authorities, the very authorities who have demonized these agents, and then arrive in two unmarked Ford Taurus\u2019s with four agents dressed in sport coats, so as not to trigger the \u201ccommunity?\u201d This is the insanity our law enforcement is up against in 2025 \u2014 sadly, some of it self-imposed. Nowhere does this insanity shine more intensely than in the statement issued by Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty following last week\u2019s search warrants. Despite being told of the nature of the operation, Moriarty put out anofficial statementcritical of the action, focusing not on the public safety benefit of investigating human trafficking and drug distribution, but rather on the fact the ICE agents were part of the operation. Moriarty stated, in part,\u201cMy singular focus is on the safety of the people who live here, and I want to be very clear that ICE showing up in the heart of one of our vibrant immigrant communities alongside local law enforcement causes grievous and irreparable harm.\u201d Now that it is known that these same agents removed nearly a half ton of deadly methamphetamine from our metropolitan area, does anyone believe Mary Moriarty, or any of the other leaders, will show the sense to acknowledge the error in their statements, and apologize for making them? Don\u2019t bet on it. Maybe the newpublic relations firmMoriarty hired to combat misinformation (at a cost of $150,000 to the county) will help her see the forest for the trees. I wouldn\u2019t bet on that either. When the chief prosecutor in the most populated county in the state has alienated herself to the point that law enforcement no longer trusts her with information, or to appropriately prosecute legitimate offenders, that is a big problem \u2014 one that serves not only Hennepin County residents poorly, but all Minnesotans poorly. **David Zimmer** David Zimmer is a Public Safety Policy Fellow at Center of the American Experiment.[email protected] **Related Content** **Feds charge 2 in high school grad shootings, plural** The U.S. Attorney announced machine gun possession charges against two men in connection with the shootings at Mariucci Arena in Minneapolis last month outside of the Wayzata High School graduation\u2026 **Feds charge 2 in high school grad shootings, plural** The U.S. Attorney announced machine gun possession charges against two men in connection with the shootings at Mariucci Arena in Minneapolis last month outside of the Wayzata High School graduation\u2026 **Shots fired at Burnsville graduation, no injuries** Another suburban high school graduation, another incident involving guns.
