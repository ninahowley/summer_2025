For the first time since 2013, Jupiter in Cancer will make its celestial rounds \u2014 not just the sign of the mother, but of home, family, emotional safety, and belonging \u2014 and the zodiac is primed to receive a yearlong success story in these domains. Before we talk about Jupiter in Cancer \u2014 which will last until June 30, 2026 \u2014 let\u2019s first consider Jupiter as a planet, then Cancer as a sign, and what this pairing can offer, especially for LGBTQ+ people. When astrologers are contextualizing what to look forward to, we look toJupiter. Though Jupiter allegedly prefers certain signs over others, it consistently brings a speedy sense of beneficial experiences: \u201cright time, right place\u201d moments, and positive outcomes in the themes of the sign it travels through for approximately a year. That\u2019s why we look to a Jupiter transit as yearly insight into where we can expect good news. While Jupiter\u2019s success tends to arrive quickly, it isn\u2019t always permanent. You\u2019ll want to look to Saturn for slow, more sustainable success. The longer I study astrology, the more I believe that of all the 12 zodiac signs, Cancer remains dangerously devalued. While I\u2019m convinced that the entire zodiac holds wisdom the culture needs to integrate, Cancer\u2019s wisdom is the only one weneedto survive. We can live \u2014 but maybe not thrive \u2014 without the other 11. We are neurobiologically hardwired for the gifts of this sign. As research inattachment theoryandpolyvagal theoryshows, safe emotional bonds, belonging, and co-regulation with others are fundamental needs, not secondary ones. They shape our wellbeing at every level. It feels fitting that John Bowlby \u2014 whose work illuminated the central role of emotional attachment in human development \u2014 was born with Jupiter in Cancer. So too wereFrida Kahloand Maya Angelou, both of whom expanded the world\u2019s understanding of home, memory, and emotional truth. As Angelou wrote, \u201cI long, as does every human being, to be at home wherever I find myself.\u201d The wisdom of this sign continues to shape how we understand what it means to be human. With Jupiter offering good news in the realm of Cancer, ask yourself: Where am I ready to organize my connections around care, commitment, safety, and support \u2014 not around convenience? How can I cultivate relationships that nourish both my longing for belonging and my need for autonomy? Where do I need clearer boundaries so that my care does not become enmeshment? As Jupiter starts its transit in Cancer, a sign it allegedly enjoys being in, we also remember that Saturn-Neptune is moving through Aries \u2014 a transit that reminds us to differentiate between genuine care and codependence. It asks us to step out of old dynamics \u2014 like the roles of victim, rescuer, or persecutor named in theKarpman Drama Triangle\u2014 and into more mature, mutual, and boundaried forms of connection. The work ahead is to offer safety and support while sustaining the integrity of our individuality, honoring differentiation, and maintaining the boundaries that prevent care from becoming enmeshment or codependence. **Aries** Visualize the best-case scenario for home, family, and safety! Ready for your soft girl era, Aries? We all know you\u2019re the zodiac\u2019s best fighter \u2014 ready to go to war for what you want and what you\u2019re passionate about. But now that Jupiter\u2019s in Cancer, you get to rest into receiving care and support from the people you\u2019ve been fighting for. Who helps the hero, right? Be willing to admit more vulnerably what you may want to feel safer and more connected with your people. You could also encounter out-of-the-blue opportunities for new living situations and healing conversations with your family of origin. Approach both with hope and curiosity, and watch the serendipity of this transit transform the most tender places of your life. **Taurus** Dream into new ways of speaking, listening, and connecting! Expand your language and you expand your world, Taurus! Your words carry more power than you may even realize. With Jupiter in Cancer, you\u2019re invited to dream into new ways of speaking, listening, and building emotional safety through communication. Conversations that once felt stuck or strained may suddenly open. Sibling andchosen family relationshipsmay heal or strengthen through your care and curiosity. Local connections, friendships, and collaborative projects can flourish when you bring more softness and imagination to how you engage. Dare to name the feelings you\u2019ve hesitated to share. The more you speak from the heart, the more aligned and supportive your connections become. **Gemini** Imagine a more nourishing relationship with money, worth, and support! You can only give from your \u201coverlow,\u201d Gemini. With Jupiter in Cancer, it\u2019s time to imagine new ways of resourcing yourself \u2014 financially, emotionally, and energetically. Where do you need to feel safer and more supported? Where are you ready to receive more? You could experience unexpected growth in your income, or find new sources of care through community and chosen family. But it all starts with how you value yourself. Dare to ask for what you need. Let the ways you give and receive resources reflect the deeper care you want to build in every part of your life. **Cancer** Dare to dream bigger about who you\u2019re becoming! Who do you want to be, Cancer? With Jupiter now moving through your sign, this is your year to dare \u2014 dare to expand, to trust, to show the world more of who you are becoming. Think of it through the lens of Stephen Covey\u2019s Be-Do-Have model: This year asks you to focus first onbeing\u2014 cultivating the identity, self-worth, and emotional truth you want to embody. From there, the doing and the having will naturally follow. Opportunities for visibility, leadership, and confidence may arrive, but your foundation is who you are becoming within. Let care and self-trust guide your growth, and this year will reshape your sense of what\u2019s possible. **Leo** Visualize the healing power of rest, reflection, and retreat! Even the Sun needs time below the horizon, Leo. With Jupiter in Cancer, this is your year to visualize the healing power of rest, reflection, and retreat. Your creative energy runs deep, but it needs nourishment. You may feel called to prioritize solitude, deepen your spiritual practices, or gently close old emotional chapters. You\u2019re not giving up but you\u2019re giving over your attachment to certain outcomes to a higher power. Behind the scenes, profound growth is taking place. Dare to honor your need for softness and quiet. The more space you give yourself to reflect and reset, the more powerful your next creative and relational chapter will become. **Virgo** Hope for friendships and communities that truly nourish you! You don\u2019t have to hold it all alone, Virgo. With Jupiter in Cancer, this is your year to hope for friendships, communities, and chosen family that offer meaningful care and connection. You may find new circles where you feel safe to be fully seen, and existing friendships may grow in depth and purpose. Collaborations will thrive when you center relationships rooted in mutual care. Let yourself invest in the spaces and people where support flows naturally. The friendships you tend this year can strengthen your sense of belonging and remind you that care is a shared experience. **Libra** Imagine new possibilities for career, leadership, and public life! Your impact is ready to grow, Libra. With Jupiter in Cancer, this is your year to imagine new possibilities for your career, leadership, and the ways you contribute to the world. You may be called into roles that ask for greater emotional intelligence and relational care. Professional opportunities can unfold through trusted relationships and your ability to create environments of safety and belonging. Let yourself take your place in spaces where your values are honored. The leadership you embody this year can reflect the kind of world you hope to help build \u2014 one where care and contribution move side by side. **Scorpio** Visualize a life that expands through learning, trust, and new horizons! Your world is ready to grow, Scorpio. With Jupiter in Cancer, this is your year to visualize a life that expands through new learning, meaningful experiences, and deepened trust in your path. You may feel called toward travel, spiritual exploration, education, or cultural experiences that nourish your inner life. Relationships with teachers, mentors, or wisdom-holders can open new ways of seeing. Let curiosity guide you toward perspectives that stretch your understanding of yourself and the world. The more you welcome experiences that bring emotional depth and insight, the more this year will shape your evolving sense of purpose. **Sagittarius** Hope for a more trusting relationship with the unknown! This is a year to build trust, Sagittarius. With Jupiter in Cancer, you are invited to hope for a more trusting relationship with the unknown \u2014 because every act of trust is a risk. As Rachel Botsman teaches, trust is a confident relationship with the unknown. It does not erase doubt; it helps you move with it. This year invites you to strengthen your ability to take thoughtful, grounded risks \u2014 especially in intimacy, shared resources, and emotional vulnerability. Building trust means expanding your tolerance for uncertainty, not bypassing it. The more you practice trust as a living skill, the more courageous and connected this year will feel. **Capricorn** Imagine relationships that expand through tension and connection! Every relationship holds a tension of opposites, Capricorn. With Jupiter in Cancer, this is your year to imagine relationships that grow through these paradoxes \u2014 through the dialectic of closeness and autonomy, stability and change, privacy and openness. You may encounter partnerships that invite you to explore these tensions with more emotional awareness and curiosity. Learning how to move through these dynamics with care will shape the quality of connection you build. Let your relationships be spaces where differences are welcomed, where trust is built through dialogue, and where mutual growth becomes possible. The more you approach connection as an evolving conversation, the richer this year will become. **Aquarius** Envision small habits that support you through big transitions! Small goals build strong foundations, Aquarius. With Jupiter in Cancer, this is your year to envision daily habits, supportive routines, and care practices that help you move through a time of major transition. With Pluto now beginning its long journey through your sign, your world is shifting in deep ways. The way you care for your body, mind, and emotional world will shape how you navigate these changes. Focus on small, consistent practices that bring steadiness: the meals you prepare, the sleep you protect, the boundaries you honor, the routines that root you. Let this year be about building a container that holds you through the transformation ahead. **Pisces** Visualize joy, creativity and pleasure you feel safe enough to trust! Joy is a skill, Pisces. With Jupiter in Cancer, this is your year to visualize joy, creativity, and pleasure that feel safe enough to trust and sustain. You may be invited into experiences of delight, play, and creative expression \u2014 but with that invitation often comes vulnerability. Let yourself move toward joy slowly and consciously. Build your tolerance for feeling good, for receiving attention, and for expressing your emotional truth through art, love, and shared experiences. Small moments of play and pleasure matter. The more you nurture what brings you alive, the more this year will help you expand your capacity to live fully.
