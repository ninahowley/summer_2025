Listen to theaudio versionof this article: THE TOPLINE The MAHA report highlights four indisputable drivers of unhealthy children\u2014ultra-processed food, toxic chemical exposure, screen-driven stress, and rampant prescription drug use\u2014yet skirts around or ignores other intertwined factors. Action items listed in the report focus on \u201cmore research\u201d instead of bold levers that could actually reverse disease trends. By avoiding hard fights with Big Ag, Big Pharma, and Big Tech, the report risks becoming another half-measure unless policymakers overhaul money flows, incentives, and regulatory capture to put children\u2019s health before corporate profit. TheMake America Healthy Again(MAHA) Commission\u2019snew reportarrives with an ambitious promise: identify the \u201croot causes\u201d of America\u2019s childhood health crisis and chart a path toward prevention. It is a welcome sign that the new administration\u2014even if only in a modest way\u2014is serious about the role of diet, sedentary lifestyles, chemical exposures, digital-age stressors, and pharmaceutical overuse instead of defaulting to one-size-fits-all medicine. Yet for those of us who have long pressed for a wholesale re-imagining of public-health policy and empowering individual choice, the document feels less like a sea change and more like the tide inching in. Here, we review what the report gets right, what it leaves out, and\u2014most important\u2014what has to happen next if we\u2019re serious about reversing the epidemic of childhood chronic disease. **Four Factors, Many Missing Pieces** It\u2019s important to note from the outset that the report can\u2019t be everything for everyone. It\u2019s been criticized by Big Ag, the media, the left as well as the right. Some havechargedthat it doesn\u2019t tackle the leading causes of death among children: firearms and motor vehicle accidents. Otherscontendthat there isn\u2019t sufficient discussion of the role genetically engineered foods play in chronic illness. Getting to grips with understanding scientifically, socially, economically, politically, and environmentally what\u2019s making American society so sick is certainly an incredibly complex business over which there is little consensus. The notion that this might be able to be tackled authoritatively in a single report was ambitious, to say the least, so no wonder critics have wasted no time picking holes in the report. The report spotlights diet quality, environmental chemicals, screen-driven behavior, and over-medicalization as key drivers of illness. No one can dispute their importance: Ultra-processed foodsthat lack adequate nutrient density now provide roughly 70 percent of children\u2019s calories, overwhelming the body\u2019s nutrient-sensing and satiety signals, disrupting metabolism and the gut microbiome, and inflaming metabolic pathways from an early age. Toxic exposures(PFAS, glyphosate, microplastics, etc.) accumulate in kids\u2019 blood and urine at levels that alarm independent scientists, with wide-ranging health consequences. Digital-age stressors\u2014excessive screen time, online bullying, sleep deprivation\u2014fuel anxiety, depression, and attention disorders. Pharmaceutical overuseis rampant; one in five US children takes at least one prescription drug each month, with little evidence that the strategy is making them healthier. So far, so good. But chronic disease is inherently multifactorial. Indoor air quality, household mold,micronutrient deficiencies,electromagnetic pollution, loss of outdoor play spaces and nature-connection, and the declining health of the human microbiome all intersect with the four buckets the MAHA Commission authors describe, along with dozens of other known factors, and likely many others still to be revealed. What about the steady march of synthetic biology, as applied to our agriculture, the food supply, and to drugs? The report nods at some of these issues but stops short of integrating them into a single, coherent framework. It is undoubtedly valuable to focus the nation\u2019s attention on these factors, and to get us thinking about concepts like \u201ctotal toxin load\u201d as it relates to our children\u2019s health. What seems lacking, however, are efforts to untangle the psycho-social, economic, environmental, and political drivers and dynamics that create a landscape where disease prevention is sidelined, and early-onset conditions like obesity, diabetes, and mental illness are becoming disturbingly common in children and young adults. Lacking too are tangible solutions that can noticeably move the needle forward on these issues. **From \u201cMore Research\u201d to Real-World Change** The MAHA Commission report\u2019s action items lean heavily on expending greater effort on problem identification rather than solution delivery. The plan is to commission more epidemiological studies, run long-term safety trials, beef up surveillance systems. Those steps matter. But anyone who has watched for decades HHS parrot out nutrition guidance from theUSDA Food and Nutrition Servicebased on faulty, Big Food-influenced USDA knows that information alone rarely shifts behavior. FDA\u2019s mandatory calorie labels did not reverse obesity;ChooseMyPlatebrochures did not flood farmers\u2019 markets with new shoppers. That raises the core question the MAHA Commission report does not fully answer: If we learn even more about multi-factorial causation, what do we do with the information, who will deliver the solutions, and how? Consider a few examples: Ultra-processed food\u2013 Will the government redirect subsidies toward regenerative farms and make real food the easy, affordable choice, or simply publish another pamphlet about \u201cbalanced diets\u201d? How do we address the issue of pesticide residues in low-cost foods that those with greatest burden of disease risk currently rely on for sustenance? Will we rein in the incremental contamination of our food with genetically modified or gene edited foods and ingredients? Chemical exposures\u2013 Will EPA phase out endocrine-disrupting pesticides and \u2018forever chemicals\u2019 (PFAS), or will risk assessments drag on while children accumulate new body burdens? We don\u2019t see many positive signs here, especially in light of the Trump administration\u2019srecent rowing backon plans to limit PFAS from drinking water. Digital stress\u2013 Will schools and tech companies re-design platforms to protect developing brains, or will parents be told (yet again) to \u201climit screen time\u201d with no structural support? How will the issue of digital addiction be addressed? Over-medicalization\u2013 Will insurance companies and the government reimburse nutrition, lifestyle, and integrative therapies, or will clinicians remain financially rewarded for writing scripts instead of spending time? Unless policymakers address these delivery mechanisms, new knowledge may add precision to our diagnosis without moving the needle on outcomes. And that\u2019s before we even start looking at the complex psychosocial, socio-economic, and behavioral drivers of unhealthy lifestyle patterns. **The Politics of Half-Measures** Industry pushback was immediate. Farm groupswarnedthat reining in glyphosate would double food costs; drug-company surrogates cried \u201canti-science\u201d at any hint of vaccine schedule review (even though the government\u2019s own National Academies said in a2013 reportthat key components of the vaccine schedule have not been adequately studied);mediaheadlinesemphasized\u201cdoom and gloom\u201d rather than opportunity with headlines like \u201cKennedy and Trump Paint Bleak Picture of Chronic Disease in U.S. Children.\u201d Even within the administration, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldinstressedthat the White House does not seek \u201ca European-style regulatory regime,\u201d code fordon\u2019t expect bold limits on chemicals any time soon. The report\u2019s reliance on \u201cprivate-sector innovation\u201d gives corporations an open lane to declare victory with superficial tweaks while maintaining business as usual. That tension explains the report\u2019s cautious tone. By limiting its prescriptions to more study, the Commission sidesteps the fiercest fights. **The Path Forward: People Over Profits** A critical point made throughout the report is the role that crony capitalism and regulatory capture play in making our children sick. For too long, our regulatory agencies, research institutions, and even medical schools have been beholden to industry funding. The result is a landscape where doctors are taught to prescribe, not prevent; where food companies write nutrition science; and where pharmaceutical interests dictate clinical guidelines. The MAHA Commission calls this out in no uncertain terms. That\u2019s a first and, in our view, a welcome and much needed step in the right direction. But unless the plan is entirely coherent, we are deeply concerned that the needle on the American people\u2019s health status won\u2019t move in the direction we hope for\u2014or at least fast enough. The contradiction in HHS and EPA policy on PFAS is a reminder of what can happen when coherence is lacking. It\u2019s no surprise that the MAHA Commission\u2019s vision crystallized in its first major report has met resistance. Powerful stakeholders are invested in the status quo. But families across the country are waking up to the reality that the system is failing our children. We don\u2019t need more pills\u2014we need fresh food, fewer toxins, more movement, and a renewed focus on mental well-being. This first MAHA report, as an opening salvo, is just the beginning and at least there are elements of it that are of value. But translating this and more into real-world results has to be the end objective and it\u2019s a task that HHS and any government agency can\u2019t ultimately do on its own. Solving the American health crisis involves something much more radical and must include empowering the people with truthful information and facilitating freedom of choice. In short: the real work lies ahead.
