The rounded tortoiseshell Akira frames were perfect, with dusky purple lenses and an elegant proportion inspired\u2014like many JMM designs are\u2014by a guy who looked iconic in sunglasses (in this case, Kurosawa). They were also incredibly expensive. Jacques Marie Mage (or JMM to fans), founded by an eccentric French expat named J\u00e9r\u00f4me Mage in 2014, makes eyewear that is extravagant in every way. Prices for the frames range from around $800 to north of $2,000, and they feel like it: JMMs are constructed with thick, glossy acetate or sleek beta titanium, colorful lenses, and flashy hardware, giving them a deeply satisfying heft. You\u2019re paying for the quality but also for the exclusivity. Each drop is limited to small quantities and never reissued. Which is cool when you\u2019re wearing them, but a bit maddening when you lose them. Even if I could afford to replace my pair, I never saw another Akira again. Unlike, say, wristwatches, sunglasses aren\u2019t typically considered a particularly rarefied good. Unless you\u2019re fond of fly fishing, most of us don\u2019t keep our sunglasses attached to our person, which means we regard our shades as easy come, easy go. For years, innovations in the eyewear space have been focused on the disposable end of the market, with startups like Goodr dining out on $25 frames that you won\u2019t mourn when you sit on them (not because the plastic frames won\u2019t break, but because the idea is to stock up on several pairs for such contingencies). Even the classics\u2014Wayfarers, Eye Jackets\u2014feel on some level like they come with a time limit, and a replica can be easily sourced. Jacques Marie Mage, on the other hand, proposes that sunglasses should be regarded more like luxury heirlooms. So far, it\u2019s catching on. In the years since I lost my pair of Akiras, JMM has proliferated in spaces frequented by the bicoastal elite. You can see bright JMM lenses gleaming in the low lighting of the Delta One Lounge, the distinctive hard-candy frames sparkling in Paris Fashion Week street-style photographs. And as JMMs have steadily multiplied on tight and well--moisturized faces, I\u2019ve noticed something else happening: usually unflappable men of taste are going nuts over their sunglasses. Talk to any JMM wearer and they\u2019ll focus their obsession on the top-tier quality of their frames, which are made in Japan through an artisanal process that caps off with several hours of painstaking acetate polishing. Fans commonly ascribe a \u201cwarmth\u201d or \u201csoulfulness\u201d to the tactile frames. Some have collections numbering in the hundreds. There is a thriving subreddit dedicated to the brand, Instagram fan accounts that document JMM celeb sightings, and a network of independent optometrist-fluencers who film TikToks fanning out over new releases. JMM admirers swear that putting on a pair for the first time is like making the switch from a cheapo quartz watch to a Swiss-made mechanical wonder. The watch comparison comes up frequently in Jacques Marie Mage\u2013land, where sunglasses are treated like precious objets d\u2019art that just so happen to have a functional utility. JMM lenses aren\u2019t especially dark, making them more practical for a candlelit dinner at Tower Bar than poolside at high noon. Yet unlike luxury watches, which are increasingly viewed by casual and serious collectors alike as investment vehicles or swappable status symbols, JMM shades encourage a stronger attachment. Anyone can post a clout-y watch on Instagram before returning it to their safe, but JMMs take on a deeply personal quality the minute you put them on your face. \u201cThey\u2019ve enhanced my life a hundredfold,\u201d Jeff Goldblum says. \u201cI\u2019m crazy about them.\u201d Goldblum, a Hollywood eyewear touchstone whose best-known role features him outrunning dinosaurs in proto-JMM sunglasses, first wore Jacques Marie Mage in 2017 and never looked back. It\u2019s perhaps no coincidence that this period corresponds with the 72-year-old actor\u2019s reemergence as an object of internet thirst. During the filming ofJurassic World Dominion,Goldblum asked J\u00e9r\u00f4me Mage to re-create Goldblum\u2019s iconic rectangular specs from the original film. It was the second collab between the two; the first, the eponymous Jeff, quickly became a bestseller. He describes them as \u201cme, as a pair of glasses,\u201d so when photographers ask him to remove his shades, he usually says no. Goldblum was an early adopter, but these days the Hollywood JMM fan club could fill the Chateau Marmont. A short list of perfect situations where other A-listers have stepped out wearing JMMs: Daniel Craig at Wimbledon, Cillian Murphy at the Oscars, LeBron James in the NBA tunnel, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet at an airport in Tokyo, Jacob Elordi on a boat in Venice, Ashley Olsen taking a smoke break, Rihanna leaving Giorgio Baldi, Lewis Hamilton at many grands prix, Jude Law running errands, Pete Davidson atSNL50,Denzel Washington arriving to set, Ryan Reynolds taking a selfie with Blake Lively. JMM has even converted dark-tint OGs like Jack Nicholson and Stevie Wonder, as well as fashion designers who have made a lot of money selling their own eyewear like Tom Ford and Pharrell. Though they certainly trend elite, the sunglasses also cross political divides and cultural hierarchies, representing a rare point where Kendrick Lamar and Lady Gaga might agree with Kid Rock and Joe Rogan, the latter of whom appeared last year onstage for a live podcast taping at Madison Square Garden wearing a pair of dark rectangular shades with delicate turquoise inlays at the temples. As Redditors quickly confirmed, they were Jacques Marie Mage Thunderclouds, which come in editions as low as 25 and retail for around $2,000. Not since the Birkin hit Calabasas has a status symbol so thoroughly captivated the celebrity class. JMM sunglasses make anyone look movie-starry\u2014 but especially movie stars.From left:Jacob Elordi in the Grand Prix. Jack Nicholson in the Dealan. Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet in the Dealan. Bad Bunny in the Duke. Tom Ford in the Enzo. There\u2019s certainly an element of follow--the-leader at play here, but the more JMM devotees you talk to, the more an extraordinary emotional dynamic emerges. After the LA wildfires, a Jacques Marie Mage customer whose house burned down showed up to one of the stores and declared that while he could handle the loss of his house and everything in it, he couldn\u2019t stomach losing his JMMs. He left with about a dozen replacements. A friend of mine I\u2019ve never known to be hyperbolic recently described buying his own Clark Kent\u2013esque JMM specs as the best decision he ever made, besides getting married. \u201cI feel incomplete without them,\u201d he says. When I lost my Akiras, I was bummed\u2014butincomplete?What is going on here? On a blusteryafternoon in January, I met J\u00e9r\u00f4me Mage, the enigmatic founder and designer, for coffee at the Four Seasons in Milan, a short walk from a brand-new Jacques Marie Mage store, the first in a global expansion that has landed a JMM boutique in London and will soon include Paris, Tokyo, and Austin, and eventually New York. (In JMM parlance, the stores are \u201cgalleries,\u201d suggesting the product inside is as much art as fashion.) \u201cI just had lunch across the street, and the couple next to me were both wearing sunglasses.Insidethe restaurant!\u201d Mage remarked with some surprise as he downed a double espresso. Mage has lived in Southern California since 1996, but he still has the snobbish sophistication of a Frenchman who studied industrial design and sculpture at a design school in Paris. In the Paris of his youth, he explained, only people like Serge Gainsbourg wore sunglasses inside\u2014or Americans. I asked if the couple had been wearing Jacques Marie Mage. \u201cNo, they were not,\u201d he said, sounding mildly relieved. \u201cOne was wearing a pair of Prada. And the other guy was wearing what looked like Oliver Peoples. Which is fine! I don\u2019t want everyone to wear it, right?\u201d I should note that Mage put his own large JMM shades on the table as soon as he sat down in the bustling hotel lobby. Mage looks every bit the swaggering Franco-Angeleno sunglasses-slinger that he is, trim and fastidiously mannered, with the rangy alertness of someone who doesn\u2019t like to sit still for too long. He wears razor-sharp suits and exotic reptilian boots and keeps his hair in a tight mohawk that he sweeps back with a pompadour flourish. Behind his smoky glasses is a sharp face and dark eyes that Goldblum describes as \u201cwildly, fiercely intelligent.\u201d I can see why Mage is obsessed with wolves, a hard-core passion that inspired him to hire a director of stewardship and live part-time in Wyoming. \u201cI\u2019m pretty intense as a person,\u201d he said at one point. His friends say that the designer has always been earnestly animated by his multifarious interests, which also include Native American art and culture, motorsports, New Wave cinema, the work of Parisian fashion designers like Yves Saint Laurent and Hedi Slimane, and the First French Empire, all of which winds its way into the business in some form or another. (\u201cI\u2019m a big Napoleonic fan,\u201d said Mage, who named a pair of round opticals after the French general\u2019s favorite architect.) Want to channelTransformer-era Lou Reed? JMM has you covered. \u201cJ\u00e9r\u00f4me follows his obsessions and is, in both his life and his work, passionate, authentic, and sophisticated,\u201d says Jeremy Strong, who has forged a bond with Mage over multiple collaborative projects, including a custom pair stamped with Kendall Roy\u2019s initials that he wore in season four ofSuccession.\u201cFor him, a pair of sunglasses are never just a pair of sunglasses; they are representative of a vision of lived life.\u201d The actor clearly sees Mage as a fellow creative warrior rather than simply a guy who makes awesome shades. \u201cHe is constantly drawing from other disciplines, other sources of inspiration, whether it is2001: A Space Odyssey,or Pueblo art in New Mexico, the work of Yukio Mishima, or the Battle of Borodino, he is trying to forge his work out of deep impulses.\u201d It takes a certain conviction to try to break into the luxury eyewear business. Though there are hundreds of stylish sunglasses brands out there, the vast majority roll up to a handful of conglomerates (EssilorLuxottica, Safilo, Kering Eyewear, LVMH-owned Th\u00e9lios) that control practically the entire market from production to point of sale. But to Mage, the idea wasn\u2019t so quixotic. \u201cI never really quite thought about it, or I never was scared or impressed,\u201d he said. \u201cI just kind of did what I knew I could do.\u201d Growing up in the small city of Clermont-Ferrand in central France, Mage was an action-sports junkie, and Southern California was the center of his world. He landed in LA in 1996 fresh out of design school and steadily built a successful creative studio that designed apparel and accessories\u2014including goggles and other technical eyewear\u2014for outdoor brands like Burton and Quiksilver. In an industry that tends to attract ski bums and Subaru drivers, Mage was a renegade force of Gallic refinement, a history buff who collected vintage YSL Rive Gauche suits and raced moto bikes on the weekends. From Top:Yves, Jagger, 2001, Cliff, Bogart, Fellini, Dasan. But the call came to leave the action-sports world when Mage discovered a glaring gap in the luxury category. In the early 2010s, he recalled, he took his young son to the venerable Silver Lake boutique Mohawk General Store, where they browsed the array of fashiony sunglasses: \u201cI asked my son, \u2018Which one do you like?\u2019 And he told me something that was so true. He was like,I don\u2019t know; everything looks the same.\u201d At the time, the trend in sunglasses was for thin, minimal interpretations of classic mid-century shapes. Mage wore bold vintage frames from the \u201970s. \u201cI couldn\u2019t see in the market anything that I liked personally.\u201d Mage moved fast, calling in every favor he had with suppliers in Japan to make the first pairs of JMMs on a shoestring budget. \u201cWhen you start and you have no money, in a weird way things are very simple,\u201d he said. \u201cI was just hoping a couple of people would buy the glasses I was designing. There was no grand plan of reinventing the way the eyewear market was structured or defined.\u201d That part, he added, \u201cbecame apparent as I was doing it.\u201d Mage regards the growing popularity of JMM with a mixture of pride and mild apprehension. \u201cThere\u2019s a bit of a slightcult,I think,\u201d he said, shifting in his seat. At least for now, his customers\u2019 desire still collides with the brand\u2019s rarity such that particularly coveted designs can change hands on thesecondary market for over $5,000. But as he prepares to double JMM\u2019s retail footprint, he\u2019s wary of the cult letting in too many members. Ofeveryonewearing them. \u201cI think that\u2019s a dilemma of fashion and luxury: The harder it is to get, the more desirable it is. But as it becomes more desirable and you see more of it, then the less desirable it becomes.\u201d At one point, Mage told me that in his day-to-day he generally doesn\u2019t see anyone wearing JMM. Which means that he must not check Instagram very often. Or hang around with stylist George Cortina, who has a rakish JMM collaboration to his name. \u201cI was at a barbecue the other night,\u201d Cortina tells me, \u201cand Dan Levy was like,Hello, you\u2019re not going to say anything? I\u2019m wearing your sunglasses!\u201d Cortina is well aware of the brand\u2019s VIP boom, seeing as he\u2019s introduced JMM to the likes of Jacob Elordi and Brad Pitt, the latter of whom, Cortina says, proceeded to immediately purchase 10 pairs. (It should be noted these intros happened atGQcover shoots.) Pieces from his extensive collection of Native American artifacts hang in Mage's Venice studio. \u201cI think there\u2019s a sharpness to the way I do things,\u201d Mage responded when I asked him about his brand\u2019s starry following. His fans, he added, tend to have \u201ca sharp idea of their taste, a sharp idea of the construction of themselves and their own aesthetic. Jeremy [Strong] and Tom [Ford], obviously they don\u2019t have the same style, but I think they have a certain appreciation for philosophy, literature, fashion, aestheticism, furniture, craftsmanship, and then that becomes a catalyst. They are both interested in a certain amount of excellence.\u201d Of course, if there\u2019s one thing that unites the entire JMM ecosystem, it\u2019s an interest in looking cool. Recently, Harry Styles and James Corden met up for a coffee in London behind their big JMM frames. But they weren\u2019t actually going incognito. As Cortina puts it, \u201cThese sunglasses definitely say,Look at me.\u201d Jacques Marie Mage HQis hidden behind the Hollywood store, through a door that takes you past the brand\u2019s securely locked archive and into a bright concrete space where a few staffers are at their computers wearing sunglasses fit for a nightclub. Mage, a can of Red Bull in hand, talks me through a list of upcoming collaborative projects as we pass by crowded mood boards and stacks of 3D-printed prototypes. I spot frames scrawled with the names of Kim Gordon, Ayrton Senna, Muhammad Ali, and Patti Smith. Smith, Mage says, was already wearing JMM before they got in touch: \u201cI think maybe what she recognized in us is that true love for art and authenticity.\u201d We step into Mage\u2019s bookshelf-lined office, which has a vitrine holding Napoleon figurines in one corner and several shelves of merchandise from the Formula 1 legend Senna in another. On his artfully cluttered desk there\u2019s a needle-sharp pencil next to a tidy sketch of a squarish frame with pleasantly tapered arms, a new design for an unspecified forthcoming collaboration. With a touch of steeliness in his voice, Mage hints at a looming deadline. \u201cI\u2019ve got a bunch of sketches to do in the next two days,\u201d he says, taking a sip of his energy drink. Mage\u2019s bucket-list-caliber lineup of collaborations is a testament to JMM\u2019s current cool factor but also to the immense pressure he\u2019s under to constantly come up with fresh ideas. After all, the engine of the brand\u2019s growth can only be fueled by pile after pile of small-batch frames. \u201cWhen we get to our size, it becomes a bit more complicated,\u201d he says of JMM\u2019s commitment to limited-edition drops. And there are plenty of people waiting for the JMM phenomenon to falter. \u201cI have a huge target on my back,\u201d Mage acknowledges. \u201cThey all know everything we do,\u201d he adds of the big guys. \u201cThey buy everything we do to try to copy it.\u201d (At least one prominent luxury brand recently introduced a new line of obvious JMM dupes.) Mage in Venice Beach with his vintage Buick Regal. One potential way of staving off\u2014or at least profiting from\u2014the inevitability of other players copying the independent brand of the moment would be for JMM to make as many pairs as customers want to buy. \u201cEveryone wants me to make 5,000 pairs of black Dealans. Right now. Make50,000pairs! Everyone wants that,\u201d Mage says. \u201cBut I don\u2019t,\u201d he says, his voice lowering to a soft growl. \u201cI mean, it would kill this project. It would kill us. It would killme.\u201d Over lunch at a local French bistro, Mage expands on his strategy, using a favorite metaphor. \u201cThe wolf is a great teacher,\u201d he offers. \u201cThere are qualities I recognize in wolves in terms of leadership, social behavior, so many things. Lead from compassion, stay on the offensive, you can never take anything for granted. If a wolf takes things for granted, he\u2019ll lose his territory, he\u2019ll lose his food, he\u2019ll die.\u201d In the face of growing competition, and growing ubiquity, Mage is leaning into his own intensity. As the business keeps growing, he says, \u201cI want to create even more rarity.\u201d What that will look like, practically speaking, is more buzzy collaborations, an \u00fcber-luxe offering of frames made of genuine horn, and many more new shapes yet to be sketched. Plus plenty of new personal accessories that have a way of captivating men of a certain taste. Mage is planning to launch a new fine jewelry collection in June with the opening of his Paris store, and to expand the brand\u2019s existing offering of wallets and small leather goods. He also hints that a major new obsession could be on the horizon. \u201cI already know what I want to do in watches,\u201d he tells me. \u201cI know it\u2019s a very difficult industry to break into, but it doesn\u2019t necessarily scare me.\u201d As for the brand\u2019s existing fans, I\u2019m not sure anything can turn them off from their beloved specs. A couple of weeks after seeing Mage in LA, I met with a French fashion designer who has been wearing JMMs since 2018. Recently, the designer updated their prescription and went to their local high-end optician to get new frames. \u201cI said, I don\u2019t want Jacques Marie Mage because all of my customers wear Jacques Marie Mage,\u201d they told me. They tried on everything else in the shop. \u201cAt the end of the day,\u201d the designer said with a shrug, \u201cI left with two more Jacques Marie Mage glasses, because he is the best.\u201d Samuel HineisGQ\u2019s global fashion correspondent.
