My mother \u201cdidn\u2019t grow up in an ideal family situation,\u201d social media influencerSara Phelpssays, but when she began attending The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints with a neighbor friend, \u201cthese pure and simple truths changed her life.\u201d \u201cBecause of what she learned at church,\u201d Phelps recalls, her mom \u201cfelt a hope for the future that things could change for her, and that one day she could have a temple marriage and an eternal family like so many of the happy families she witnessed around her attending church every week.\u201d And she did. Phelps was raised by her mom and dad to relish these same truths, which guide her own growing family today. Yet this young mother wonders whether some members of the Church today would be \u201ctoo afraid\u201d to teach a young girl from a different background about God\u2019s plan for families. **Scared to Share** There was a time when Phelps herself felt hesitant to broach this same subject since the church\u2019s \u201cFamily Proclamation\u201d was becoming, in her words, a \u201cvery controversial topic\u201d \u2014with prominent voices in the larger culture increasingly \u201cloud\u201d and leaving members feeling like they are \u201chateful and mean for supporting that.\u201d This is certainly not the only topic that\u2019s become fraught in modern America, reflected in thecommon fearamong people (onboth sides of the political spectrum) when it comes to sharing openly what they think and believe about many important questions. That includes other Christians whoadmitfear can stop them from sharing their faith. Of course, many other people of faith raise their voices freely and warmly for anyone who will listen. And Latter-day Saints around the world share truths about families and the Savior Jesus Christ widely, even if they\u2019re not always sure of the best way to do that. \u201cI knew what was right in my heart,\u201d Phelps says, \u201cbut I didn\u2019t know how to articulate it.\u201d While remarking on some poor examples of overly forceful family advocacy in the past, she says \u201cthe pendulum has swung completely in the opposite direction,\u201d where some people \u201cwon\u2019t really even talk about it at all.\u201d When others see the proclamation brought up, they say something like, \u201cWait, are you still even teaching about that? It\u2019s not even relevant anymore.\u201d **Repeated Prophetic Emphasis** Since the beginning of the restoration, leaders of The Church of Jesus of Latter-day Saints have emphasized the importance of marriage, children, and family. But a potent re-emphasis came on Sept. 23, 1995, when President Gordon B. Hinckley stood before the general Relief Society meeting andstatedthat in a world of so much sophistry, deception, and allurement, \u201cwe have felt to warn and forewarn.\u201d \u201cIn furtherance of this, we of the First Presidency and the Council of the Twelve Apostles now issue a proclamation to the Church and to the world as a declaration and reaffirmation of standards, doctrines, and practices relative to the family which the prophets, seers, and revelators of this church have repeatedly stated throughout its history.\u201d Since the historic announcement of \u201cThe Family: A Proclamation to the World,\u201d men and women leading the Church have continued speaking repeatedly and emphatically about marriage being \u201cordained of God\u201d and the \u201csacred duty\u201d of parents to raise their children \u201cin love and righteousness.\u201d In the last 5 years alone, this proclamation has been mentioned multiple times inconferencebymultipleapostlesandprophets. Three different times since2017, now-President Dallin H. Oaks, in the First Presidency, has specificallyaffirmedthe unique value of the truths in this proclamation to help people prepare for \u201cexaltation\u201d or \u201ceternal life.\u201d \u201cThose who do not fully understand the Father\u2019s loving plan for His children may consider this family proclamation no more than a changeable statement of policy,\u201d President Oakstaughtlast year. \u201cIn contrast, we affirm that the family proclamation, founded on irrevocable doctrine, defines the mortal family relationship where the most important part of our eternal development can occur.\u201d \u201cThis is so much more than a document,\u201d says Carol Rice, part of a team that created awebsite dedicated to the teachings and supportive researchon the Family Proclamation. \u201cIt\u2019s not an amicus brief; it is not a memo or letter,\u201d she says about the text. \u201cIt is a divinely condensed version of the order of heaven and God\u2019s plan for his children. It is a witness and a warning. He is the author.\u201d **Not Going There as \u2018Loving\u2019?** Latter-day Saint writer Cassandra Hedelius hasobserveda growing \u201ctrend\u201d among online influencers and activists attempting to \u201cpersuade members of the Church to keep quiet about the doctrines of chastity and marriage.\u201d Jelaire Richardson, a Latter-day Saint mother living overseas, described \u201cdozens\u201d of times when she\u2019s mentioned the Family Proclamation to someone\u2014suggesting it may be good to bring up in a class lesson, for instance\u2014but hearing something like, \u201cWell, I\u2019m not sure how my Sunday School class feels about the Family Proclamation, so I\u2019d rather not bring it up in case it leads to contention.\u201d Or \u201cWell, some of the kids in my Young Women\u2019s class come from a home with divorced parents, so I want to be sensitive to that.\u201d Phelps readily admits that discussing family and marriage \u201cdoes require sensitivity\u201d depending on the audience, given the wide variety of family living situations that depart from the aspirations outlined in the proclamation (marriage between a man and a woman who find happiness together, bring children into the world, and seek to follow Christ together). When it comes to people who have never married or divorced\u2014or experienced unhappy marriages, infertility, struggling children, or abuse in any form\u2014the argument goes, \u201cWhy would you bring up ideals these people haven\u2019t been able to experience yet? Don\u2019t you realize this will make them feel bad?\u201d\u201cWho is suffering because we won\u2019t talk about this?\u201dAnd so some people stop talking about the family proclamation altogether. \u201cI can\u2019t remember the last time I\u2019ve heard it mentioned at church,\u201d writes Latter-day Saint therapist Rebecca Taylor. \u201cWho is suffering because we won\u2019t talk about this?\u201d \u201cWho is suffering because we won\u2019t talk about this?\u201d In some cases, this has created an atmosphere where speaking openly about these family truths feels exceptional. Attorney Brent Andrewsen recounts his daughter and her husband speaking about the proclamation in their ward four years ago and being told by several members afterward \u201chow brave\u201d they were\u2014with another ward member mailing them a personal note thanking the family for their \u201cboldness\u201d and courage. **The Greater Danger** A lot obviously depends on how these truths are presented, Phelps hints, pointing out the obvious: that getting in people\u2019s faces is helpful to no one. \u201cI think we all know that, right?\u201d But some today have concluded, Phelps adds, \u201cthat in order to show sensitivity and compassion, we need to avoid, tip-toe around, downplay or even denounce the Family Proclamation.\u201d The seeming takeaway, Richardson says, is that even a mention (or glimpse) of the proclamation is somehow inherently \u201ccontentious\u201d or insensitive\u2014an argument she rejects. Leaders of the Church \u201cconstantly show us how to chart a loving course that welcomes all and forthrightly teaches all our doctrine,\u201d Hedelius adds\u2014without, again, denying some, especially online, who may still, unfortunately, use doctrine to \u201costracize.\u201d Members of a lay-run church also acknowledge \u201cvarying amounts of good-intentioned clumsiness\u201d occasionally present in a lesson, alongside a collective need to keep improving our ability to teach skillfully with true charity and love. But it\u2019s not just the sharer and teacher who need encouragement. Richardson also calls attention to the importance of listeners needing encouragement to receive teachings \u201cwith soft hearts and gratitude \u2026 gratitude that this doctrine even exists at all.\u201d After acknowledging some possible stumbles culturally, Hedelius argues that \u201cthe far greater danger in many congregations is opposition to any teaching about marriage and chastity at all.\u201d While some insist family doctrine is \u201calready well known,\u201d Hedelius says, others \u201cclaim lessons or talks about marriage and chastity just drive people away, so they\u2019re not worth it.\u201d **Not Going There Actually Hurts People** There are consequences for this kind of subtle, indirect silencing, according to these women. \u201cI\u2019m afraid that there are generations of people and kids right now that aren\u2019t realizing how important these truths about the family are,\u201d Phelps says, \u201cthat aren\u2019t realizing that the most chance you have for success and happiness in your home is two parents, a mom and a dad married in the temple, raising their children in the gospel of Jesus Christ.\u201d \u201cThere are a lot of people right now that don\u2019t really realize that, or that aren\u2019t being taught that,\u201d she says, \u201cand I feel that I owe a lot of my happiness in life to those principles, and so I feel a responsibility to share those things.\u201d In her2023 book, \u201cThe Two-Parent Privilege: How Americans Stopped Getting Married and Started Falling Behind,\u201d Melissa Kearney, an economist at the University of Maryland, discusses the economic impact of declining marriage rates and the increase in children raised in single-parent households. BYU\u2019s Jenet Erickson hasexploredhow much babies and children specifically need a mother and a father. \u201cI did not have a good home environment growing up. I had no idea what healthy families looked like,\u201d a new convert to the Church shared on Facebook. \u201cThe only place I ever got good advice and modeling of good parenting was class comments during Relief Society lessons (for Latter-day Saint women).\u201d \u201cIf it weren\u2019t for sisters sharing their insights and recommendations here and there on Sundays, I never would have learned how to do things like discipline my kids well,\u201d she continued. \u201cMotherhood would have been overwhelming if it hadn\u2019t been for ladies sharing in church about their childrearing insights.\u201d Phelps speaks of feeling especially encouraged by teachings from President Russell M. Nelson, including from a2014 BYU speechin which he said, \u201cWherever we go, you and I, as disciples of the Lord, bear a solemn responsibility to proclaim the will of God to all people. And one of the more demanding opportunities of our time is to stand up for the truth regarding the sacred nature of marriage.\u201d \u201cI love this quote,\u201d Phelps says, \u201cbecause I\u2019ve found a lot of people think we don\u2019t really have a responsibility to share the truth. They\u2019ll say loving others is our only job,\u201d she says, pointing out how the prophets teach something else. \u201cAs disciples of Christ, we must love all men and proclaim the truth\u2014a delicate and tricky balance, especially in today\u2019s climate. We cannot have one without the other and I\u2019m continually working on how to best strike that balance myself.\u201d \u201cWho is suffering because we won\u2019t talk about this?\u201d Phelps asks. **Tired of Being Silent** Although Phelps has always believed and supported these teachings, she says she didn\u2019t realize how \u201cvital\u201d it was to share this with her own children until a recent eureka moment. \u201cWhoa. What\u2019s in this document is powerful,\u201d\u2014prompting her to feel especially sad that its teachings are sometimes \u201cgetting ignored\u201d because \u201cwe don\u2019t want to hurt people\u2019s feelings.\u201d So, Phelps decided to start sharing someproclamation-specific messagesonher Instagram, explaining in one of her messages, \u201cI won\u2019t downplay it, I won\u2019t ignore it, and I won\u2019t act as if somehow because times have changed, it\u2019s now irrelevant or too hurtful and insensitive.\u201d Carol Rice has observed a \u201crise\u201d on social media of \u201cfaith content creators discussing the proclamation\u201d\u2014telling me, \u201cI feel I am witnessing \u2026 the new generation rediscovering the wisdom of this proclamation.\u201d **Opposition In All Things** Although receiving many messages of support, Phelps acknowledges a degree of \u201cbacklash\u201d that can come when someone is willing to speak openly about the \u201cFamily Proclamation.\u201d \u201cI understand why people are afraid, but I again think we are doing a massive disservice to those around us when we are too afraid to speak up, and we don\u2019t teach this. Not enough people know how important these truths about the family really are.\u201d \u201cYou will likely encounter increasing debate about the definition of marriage,\u201d President Nelson lateracknowledges, adding, \u201cMany of your neighbors, colleagues, and friends will have never heard logical and inspired truths about the importance of marriage as God Himself defined it.\u201d \u201cActivism is increasing the social and emotional cost of teaching and testifying,\u201d Hedelius writes, inducing those who are committed to the gospel to \u201cfearfully introspect: Am I failing to be gentle and Christlike? Am I just clinging to hateful, outdated ideas? \u2026 Is it really necessary to teach this when it might cause discomfort? Will my friends and fellow congregants criticize me for being insensitive?\u201d Hedelius summarizes one specific worry many people grapple with: \u201cStraightforwardly teaching and testifying of the doctrine is failing to be gentle and Christlike to people who are struggling with sexuality and identity.\u201d It\u2019s true, Phelps says, that \u201csome people seem to think that it means that I have no sensitivity towards people who identify as LGBT+\u201d\u2014before highlighting the blessing of personal revelation available to help people in different situations understand how to apply prophetic truths in their lives. \u201cThese doctrines and truths are too powerful and too important not to share,\u201d this mother and influencer says, even with the expected push-back\u2014pointing to how many people end up being encouraged when she does so. \u201cFor our own personal benefit, our children\u2019s benefit, and society\u2019s benefit, we need strong families,\u201d Phelps says. \u201cI\u2019m convinced it would fix many of the issues plaguing our society today.\u201d **Teach The Children Freely** It\u2019s not just out of the home where this hesitance can arise. Some parents have even felt hesitant to teach their children about Latter-day Saint doctrine on the family. In recent years,Cassandra HedeliusandMeagan Koehlerhave both pushed back on the tendency to portray religious parents as somehow exclusive in the socialization they try to provide for their children. \u201cSomeone whose thirty hours on TikTok has convinced them biological sex is an arbitrary social construct,\u201d Hedeliuswrites, \u201chas been indoctrinated just as surely as someone whose thirty hours in the scriptures (or a biology textbook) has convinced them it\u2019s not.\u201d \u201cNo matter what,\u201d she says, children will be taught and socialized. \u201cThe question is, by whom? And with what doctrine? By you? By the Church? By their friends? By the media and social media?\u201d LikeAdam and Eve, we need to \u201cteach these things freely unto your children,\u201d she says\u2014appreciatinghowthe \u201cjoy of redemption through Christ is inseparably connected with the joy of marriage and children.\u201d \u201cIf activism within a particular congregation succeeds in problematizing the doctrine\u2014making it solely a matter of private study, not to be brought up in Christlike company,\u201d Hedelius adds, \u201cthat\u2019s essentially as effective as a sermon proclaiming it isn\u2019t true.\u201d \u201cThis will take a particular toll on the youth and new members, who will certainly notice that people shift in their chairs and awkwardly study their toes whenever teachings about family and marriage come up,\u201d she says. \u201cThey\u2019ll be subtly persuaded not to believe the \u2018controversial\u2019 doctrine.\u201d **\u201cMy Family Doesn\u2019t Neatly Fit the Standards\u201d** For those who feel like their family doesn\u2019t line up with the \u201cideal family,\u201d Phelps cautions against discouragement, which she says is \u201cthe opposite message of the gospel of Jesus Christ.\u201d \u201cThere is always hope. All is never lost.\u201d After someone commented critically on one of her online messages about the \u201cProclamation,\u201d saying \u201cnot everyone meets the standard\u201d and \u201cthis is offensive,\u201d Phelps\u2019 husband suggested, \u201cWell, if everybody met the standard, then there would be no reason for (the \u201cProclamation\u201d) in the first place.\u201d \u201cWould we ever not want to teach the Word of Wisdom if we knew a teenager\u2019s mother smoked?\u201d Richardson asks. \u201cOf course not. Avoiding that teaching would actually be more of a disservice to that personbecauseof her situation.\u201d She needs to hear testimony and clarity she may not be getting at home and have a \u201cchance to feel the Spirit so she can develop her own testimony of it.\u201d \u201cAs a single person, I sometimes find the family proclamation to be a painful reminder,\u201d writes therapist Rebecca Taylor. \u201cBut at the same time, I am immeasurably grateful for it.\u201d \u201cWe can try to be sensitive and mindful of the many (most!) whose lives don\u2019t fit the ideal, but that doesn\u2019t mean we should not talk about it. I see evidence of its importance with my clients all the time.\u201d \u201cIf not now, teachers who tend to be avoidant need to ask themselves: When would it be appropriate to bring it up?\u201d Richardson asks. \u201cWhen will we ever have a class full of students who all live perfect lives, and whose home lives are perfect, and who know and live every single point of doctrine with exactness?\u201d She then states the obvious: \u201cIf we can\u2019t teach truth if anyone in our class struggles with something, or has a family member who struggles with something, we will simply never have the chance to teach truth.\u201d **\u2018It changed their life (and mine)\u2019** \u201cEvery time a bishop shies away from assigning a speaker to preach the doctrine of marriage and chastity, children are deprived of an important spiritual opportunity,\u201d Hedeliusconcludes. \u201cEvery time a Primary teacher shies away from testifying that marriage between a man and a woman is ordained of God, children are deprived of needed spiritual nourishment.\u201d At the same time, \u201cEvery time a speaker enthusiastically testifies of the doctrine of marriage and chastity, but the tension in the room mounts and members frown at their shoes, children are taught to constrain their faith. Every time a children\u2019s activity leader preaches [that] we must only \u2018listen\u2019 and \u2018validate\u2019 and \u2018hold space for\u2019 (those with doubts) but never stand up for the doctrine of marriage and chastity, children\u2019s light is extinguished.\u201d Even though her parents would have been the kids where people could have said, \u201cOh, they\u2019re coming to church; let\u2019s be careful. Let\u2019s not say anything that would hurt feelings,\u201d Phelps describes how grateful she was they grew up in a time where it wasn\u2019t so \u201cpolitically correct,\u201d and they learned what the truth was. \u201cIt was great. It put them on a good path, and it changed their life. And so it changed mine.\u201d **About the author** **Jacob Z.
