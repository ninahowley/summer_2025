But it turns out William might not be entirely against the idea, he andKate Middletonare just going to be very busy as they take on more royal responsibilities. According to theScottish Daily Express,royal insiders have claimed that palace staff are growing increasingly irritated with William and Kate\u2019s insistence on doing everything their own way. The couple may well be the most popular of all the royals, but behind palace walls they are being criticized for shirking their royal duties. **Prince William and Kate are under pressure to do more** The royal couple are apparently seen as work-shy by staffers \u2014 an opinion which wasshared by many even before Kate\u2019s cancer scareback in 2024. In recent months Kate and William haveput family ahead of royal dutieswhich has earned them both praise and criticism. While putting family first is certainly admirable, the future King and Queen are expected to do much more for the monarchy than they are currently doing. Telegraph associate editor Camilla Tominey claims that aides have expressed concern that they \u201cmay be spending too much time with their immediate family instead of supporting the \u2018Firm\u2019.\u201d She goes on to say that the Prince and Princess of Wales are \u201cunder growing pressure to up their workload.\u201d While they have been upping their workload both are still lagging behind many other members of the royal family. William has attended many royal events but in some caseshis father has had to practically force him to go. He\u2019s also received criticism for still finding the time to pursue personal endeavours. **This means reconciliation with Harry is unlikely** Surprisingly Tominey claims that William has cooled down on the subject of his brother. Harry recently spoke of reuniting with his family in the U.K. but sources suggestedWilliam and Kate were unable to move past his betrayal. She claims that the heir to the throne has had a change in attitude but that doesn\u2019t mean he and the Duke of Sussex will be meeting in person anytime soon. With all the pressure on Kate and William to take on more work, reuniting with Harry is reportedly \u201clow down their list of priorities.\u201d It seems the anger has subsided, but as you can imagine, they aren\u2019t exactly jumping to welcome Harry back with open arms. Unfortunately for Harry, William and Kate are content to just \u201clet sleeping dogs lie.\u201d With all the extra work they are likely going to be taking on the Duke will no doubt be put on the backburner. Friends insist there is still \u201cno way back\u201d for him.
