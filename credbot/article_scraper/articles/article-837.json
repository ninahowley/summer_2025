Our company is dedicated to the preservation of community journalism. Since the purchase of our 1st paper in late-2020 to today, we have prided ourselves on our ability to fight the difficult battle that newspapers face in today\u2019s digital society. Unfortunately, that battle cannot always be won. The Leominster Champion, has struggled in recent years to find its footing in this community. Since purchasing The Leominster Champion, CherryRoad Media has been unable to avoid financial losses every month. The paper was losing money when we bought it, and it continued to do so. We must now come to terms with the fact that we do not have a path forward to sustainability. And we thank those who have supported us. **Upcoming programs at the Leominster Public Library, week of July 22** July 17, 2024 Lifestyle For all programs that require registration, the library staff will hold your spot for 10 minutes past the scheduled start time of the program; after that, your spot may be given to someone who is waiting.
