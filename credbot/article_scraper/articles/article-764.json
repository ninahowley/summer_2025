Since 2000, Knight Foundation has invested more than $50 million in St. Paul, focusing on downtown revitalization and supporting local entrepreneurship.

Knight Foundation has also supported the Greater River Passage Conservancy\u2019s plan to activate and reconnect the Mississippi waterfront with downtown and the St. Paul Downtown Alliance to establish a downtown development corporation. Reflecting on her new role at Knight Foundation, Bradley shared her excitement: \u201cSt. Paul is a city rich with history, culture and community spirit. I am eager to collaborate with local partners and residents to amplify the ideas and initiatives that make our community stronger and more connected.\u201d Bradley emphasized that her approach will focus on fostering meaningful partnerships and leveraging local insights to create sustainable impact. \u201cI believe that listening to community voices and building on existing strengths are key to making a lasting difference.
