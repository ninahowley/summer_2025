The Government's upcoming food strategy must urgently address this ticking timebomb for public health and include measures to dramatically increase fruit and veg consumption in the UK and recommend plant-based diets. Low intake of fruit, vegetables and fibre is consistently linked to a multitude of chronic health conditions including Type 2 Diabetes, cardiovascular disease and bowel cancer. Governments elsewhere in the world are taking action now to ensure their citizens are able to eat more healthy, sustainable, plant-based foods. Here in the UK, successive governments have been bystanders as diets have deteriorated. This new data shows that current efforts are not working. There is a critical need for the government to lead a transition towards plant-rich diets and take steps to ensure that plant-based foods are accessible, affordable and attractive to people including through providing practical education for the general public about growing, preparing and cooking fruit, vegetables, pulses and wholegrains; integrated and holistic public health campaigns to promote fruit and vegetable consumption; and encouraging food supply companies to take up the challenge of transitioning towards a higher proportion of sales of plant-based foods. People want to eat healthier and more sustainable diets and the government must make it as easy as possible. **News** News Blog Events Competitions Media Market insights **Sign-up for our newsletter** Join our newsletter to receive monthly competitions, offers and information on all things vegan.
