The report, \u201cNavigating the Intelligence Community IT Roadmap,\u201d analyzes key challenges facing the IC and outlines how existing and tested technology capabilities can help IC components gain a strategic advantage over adversaries. The report\u2019s timely release aligns with the IC\u2019s five-year IT roadmap, which seeks to advance intelligence operations by promoting seamless collaboration, enhanced data sharing and management and the ability to deploy the newest tech innovations rapidly. The report highlights a variety of currently available technical capabilities developed by GDIT as part of its long-standing work to support the U.S. defense and intelligence agencies, including: DeepSky\u2014 a private, multi-cloud, on-prem data center environment developed and maintained by GDIT that facilitates the testing of emerging technology and security capabilities from multiple providers in collaboration with government agencies and their partners. \u201cIt\u2019s really difficult to ingest massive amounts of data from a bunch of tools and make it usable for an engineer, an analyst or an executive. So DeepSky helps make those tools work together,\u201d says Ryan Deslauriers, director of cybersecurity at GDIT. Mission Partner Environments\u2014 a new generation of interoperable networking and data exchange environments. Originally designed to allow military units to exchange data with specific partners, these expanded information-sharing environments enable the selective yet secure sharing of sensitive and classified information with trusted military and coalition partners. MPEs make it possible to take a \u201cfull report, break out what can and can\u2019t be released, and push it to the appropriate network virtually and automatically so that information gets to relevant users where they are in a timely fashion,\u201d explains Jennifer Krischer, a former U.S. Air Force intelligence officer who now serves as vice president for defense intelligence at GDIT. Raven\u2014 a mobile command center tech suite developed by GDIT that fits in the back of a truck. It extends and deploys the data mesh concept to mobile environments. It can be utilized for disaster relief, special forces operations, or disconnected environments, enabling operators to collect and disseminate data from the tactical edge directly to users on the ground and back to the enterprise. Raven is an example of how GDIT \u201cenables teams to conduct their mission without having to develop, build, maintain, and operate the services internally,\u201d notes Nicholas Townsend, senior director at GDIT. Federated Data Fabric\u2014 creates a unified data environment through a centralized service platform designed to streamline data curation, management, and dissemination and enable seamless access to data independent of its source or security level. It allows users on the network\u2019s edge to discover, request, publish and subscribe to information within a federated network environment. Workforce commitment The report also highlights GDIT\u2019s distinctive approach to hiring and training professionals with extensive defense, IC, and technical experience who uniquely understand the needs of the government\u2019s mission. \u201cOur workforce two to five years from now will need to be different from what it is today and prepared to take advantage of new technology,\u201d notes Chaz Mason, mission engineering and delivery lead at GDIT. Recognizing this, GDIT doubled its investment in tuition and technical training programs in 2023. More than 20,000 employees have taken at least one of our cyber, AI, and cloud upskilling programs, he said. GDIT\u2019s staff currently numbers 30,000 professionals supporting customers in over 400 locations across 30 countries; 25%+ of the workforce are veterans.
