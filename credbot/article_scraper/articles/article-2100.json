Nobody was in the mood for humor that day. I wrote this piece to get over my depression, because laughter is the best medicine. I re-read the piece the other day and thought, \u201cOh, if only, if only it had really happened this way!\u201dCrack open a cold one and I hope you enjoy. Happy St. Patrick\u2019s Day! The original title was\u201cDonald\u2019s Magical Moving Day, The Movie\u201d TRUMP (turns and sees a shadow darting down the hall) \u201cHey, who\u2019s there? I\u2019m talking to you!\u201d (Trump lumbers towards the sound) A VOICE \u201cNow calm down, boyo, you\u2019ll be givin\u2019 yourself a fit.\u201d TRUMP (drops his phone, when a small being steps out of the shadows) \u201cHoly s*it! What are YOU?!\u201d FLANNERY \u201cThe name\u2019s Flannery. As to what I am, what do you think that I might be, you odmahun,* being three and a half feet tall, dressed in green velour and smokin\u2019 a pipe? I live here too, ya know.\u201d TRUMP \u201cYou live here? How?\u201d FLANNERY \u201cWhy I was invited, don\u2019t ya know. I\u2019ve lived here since that nice young Irishman graced these hallways. Oh, he was a fine man, that one. Very beloved by the Irish and everyone else. The Irish don\u2019t like you I must say. Nor their American cousins. I don\u2019t like you meself.\u201d TRUMP \u201cHey, I\u2019m the boss!\u201d FLANNERY \u201cSomebody\u2019s boss, to be sure and somebody\u2019s president, too, but not mine and not my kinfolk\u2019s. Be that as it may, I am willing to help you, because I\u2019m willing to help my fine adopted country. I have something that you need. Something that Lincoln left for his karmic twin, whomever that might be, and it turned out to be Kennedy. And Kennedy bequeathed it to all presidents worthy of the name. No Republican has ever gotten this legacy, it shouldn\u2019t surprise ya, and the chances of you getting it are less than none. So I\u2019m here to help.\u201d TRUMP \u201cHuh?\u201d FLANNERY \u201cDo I now? And what\u2019s in it for me? TRUMP \u201cOh, they are that, to be sure. The gifts of the spirit and of a true and virtuous life. And they\u2019re available to anyone just for the takin. What you\u2019re able to make of them depends upon you, entirely.\u201dTRUMP \u201cWell, now, that\u2019s that. Garbage in garbage out. (Flannery puffs on his pipe.) Sort of like Guy Fawkes day, without all the fuss. The moral of this wee tale is, \u201cVirtue is its own reward and lack of virtue\u2026is its own reward too. Oh, and immigrants, we get the job done. Time to go home and watch me Twilight Zone re-runs. Sliante!**\u201d (Flannery leaps into the air and clicks his heels together. As his heels touch there\u2019s a burst of white smoke and he vanishes. The white smoke curls up into the sky as we hear the sound of sirens squealing in the background, and a harvest moon appears on the horizon next to the Washington Monument in the distance.) ** Sliante! \u2014 Irish blessing pronounced \u201cslan-sha.\u201d The Irish use it to toast one another\u2019s health.

Or my parents and grandparents for that matter. It happens even to the best and brightest of them. Of course some have been neither the best and/or brightest to begin with but I\u2019m getting ahead of myself.Humorist Dave Barry\u2019s musings made me laugh again and again over the years when he put his thoughts to paper. In one weekly piece he postulated that hidden somewhere in the attic of the White House is a machine that puts out stupid rays specifically tuned to affect Presidents, and that over time it makes them progressively more stupid. Personally I think there\u2019s something to Barry\u2019s theory when you look at history and Presidential statements or decisions that cause even supporters to go WTF? Barry didn\u2019t take it this far, but I think the machine\u2019s rays affect some more than others. He also didn\u2019t develop the concept that some Presidents have been pretty lame in the brainpower department before even being sworn in. Maybe since most who become President visit the WH at times over the years before getting elected and it knows ahead of time they will one day occupy the Oval Office and gets a head start!

Or my parents and grandparents for that matter. It happens even to the best and brightest of them. Of course some have been neither the best and/or brightest to begin with but I\u2019m getting ahead of myself. Humorist Dave Barry\u2019s musings made me laugh again and again over the years when he put his thoughts to paper. In one weekly piece he postulated that hidden somewhere in the attic of the White House is a machine that puts out stupid rays specifically tuned to affect Presidents, and that over time it makes them progressively more stupid. Personally I think there\u2019s something to Barry\u2019s theory when you look at history and Presidential statements or decisions that cause even supporters to go WTF? Barry didn\u2019t take it this far, but I think the machine\u2019s rays affect some more than others.
