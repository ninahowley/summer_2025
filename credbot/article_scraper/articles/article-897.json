The following day, Quiogue was accused of possessing a Molotov cocktail while holding a lighter near federal buildings in downtown Los Angeles. Quiogue was spotted by police with the device and arrested, but not before throwing the device while attempting to flee, McEvoy said. Quiogue was ordered to remain detained after his initial court appearance Tuesday, while Galvez was expected to make his first court appearance in the coming days. In Orange County, Christian Andres Garcia, 32, of Anaheim and Rene Luna, 43, of Orange each face a charge of misdemeanor assault on a federal officer stemming from a Monday protest in Santa Ana. Both men face up to one year in federal prison if convicted, McEvoy said. Garcia was accused of throwing objects at law enforcement stationed outside a Homeland Security Investigations office, while Luna allegedly threw water bottles and beer cans at officers elsewhere during the same protest, McEvoy said. Both men were arrested Monday night, June 9, and were expected to make their initial court appearances in the coming days, the spokesman said. **Share this:** Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Facebook Click to share on Bluesky (Opens in new window)Bluesky Click to print (Opens in new window)Print Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window)Email Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)Reddit Click to share on X (Opens in new window)X Report an error Policies and Standards Contact Us **RevContent Feed** **Most Popular** Dear Abby: I noticed something odd in the baby photos.
