Last Updated Jun 11, 2025 10:20:50 AM. The Waterloo Region District School Board (WRDSB) shared a significant update about Elizabeth Ziegler Public School, informing the public that the school is set to undergo significant repairs, but will not be demolished altogether. The school wasforced to closein April after a concrete slab fell from the exterior fa\u00e7ade, unveiling a long list of structural issues that needed repair before students were allowed back. Since then, the school\u2019s population has transferredto alternate schools,like Sandown Public School in Waterloo, for the remainder of the school year. At acommunity meetingin March, the school board explained that it would need to hear the advice of structural engineers before deciding on the next steps for the nearly 100-year-old building. On Wednesday, the WRDSB shared results of the final report from the structural engineering firm, including months of testing of the school\u2019s internal and external structures.

It also includes the reinforcement and repairs of the building\u2019s exterior masonry. The WRDSB also explained that a new elevator will be installed, and that the upgrades will extend the life of the century-old building. \u201cWe are working with the Ministry of Education to finalize the funding source and seeking approval for the restoration from the City of Waterloo, Municipal Heritage Committee and Building Services,\u201d the board said in a press release. Students will continue to attend alternate schools in 2025/26, and the school board is unable to offer a timeline of when the work will be completed.
