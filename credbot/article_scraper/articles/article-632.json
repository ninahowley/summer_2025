Just about everyone experiences barriersto positive lifestyle habits. A2023 studyidentified the biggest barriers to healthy eating in Division 1 college athletes,a population not often associated with unhealthy habits. What did these college athletes say were among their toughest challenges? Many of the same issues others face: lack of time lack of access to healthy foods lack of knowledge about how to cook healthy food Whether you\u2019re a college athlete or not, there are simple changes you can make to more easily incorporate healthy habits into your life. Regardless of whether you want to eat better, move more, or quit smoking, these tips might just help you achieve your goals. **Lack of time** Time-saving strategies can help you make small but impactful changes in exercise and eating. **Exercise** You can incorporate exercise into your routine with just a few minutes each day. Simple changes can increase your exercise frequency. Consider taking the stairs instead of the elevator or parking a few blocks from your destination. Move during other activities. For instance, stretch while you\u2019re on the phone or walk instead of driving, when possible. Block out time on your calendar for exercise. It can be as little as 15-minute blocks. Ideally, you build up to at least30 minutesof exercise, 5 days a week. Modify your current activity to increase heart rate and muscle use. Embrace \u201cexercise snacks,\u201d short bursts of exercise you can do throughout the day. These could include 10 squats, a minute of jumping jacks, or another short activity to get your heart pumping. Routine iscriticalfor healthy habits and it takes time to develop. After some weeks of taking the stairs or lifting light weights during your favorite streaming program, it\u2019s possible you won\u2019t even look for the elevator or the couch. **Healthy diet** Healthy eating doesn\u2019t have to take a lot of time and healthy meals don\u2019t have to be elaborate. In fact, focusing on preparing whole foods may even save you time in the kitchen. There are also ways to reduce your preparation and cooking times. Here are some tips: Considerbatch cooking, where you prepare ingredients for several meals, or double or triple the size of your meal and store leftovers. Preparesimple ingredientsyou can use for several meals, like quinoa for salads. Common ingredients like chopped onions or peppers can be cut up and refrigerated for future use. Prepare a larger size meal like asheet pan mealand place it into several single-serving dishes to have over the next several days. Consider a few recipes and look for common ingredients you can prep in advance. Keephealthy canned foodsin your pantry, such as beans, tuna, and tomatoes. **The science behind meal prepping and healthy habits** A2017 studythat found planning meals a few days in advance was associated with a healthier diet and less obesity. **Lack of equipment or resources** Many people face exercise or healthy eating barriers because of the perceived costs of good food or exercise programs. But there are many ways you can get the benefits of healthy habits at a lower cost. Here are some options to explore: Choose an exercise that requires little or no equipment, like body weight exercises, skipping rope, or walking. Items in your home, such as food cans or books, can double as light weights. Check out exercise programs at a community center or church. Organizations often offer classes, groups, and gyms at reduced costs. Stream free home workout programsofferedby organizations like the American Heart Association. There are also plenty of fun workout videos onYouTube. Try afitness app. Although some fitness apps cost money, others are free. Comparison shop for groceries. Look for store-brand dry goods like lentils and quinoa at lower prices than brand-name products. Cook at home.Researchshows home cooking can reduce food costs compared to ordering prepared foods. There are also ways to cut down on your grocery store bill and stilleat healthy when on a tight budget. If you use tobacco, there arefree resourcesto help you quit. Consider thequitSTART appor free coaching through the Centers for Disease Control (CDC)\u2019s helpline at 1-800-QUIT-NOW. **Lack of social support** Sometimes, you want to make a change, but those closest to you don\u2019t share your interest or motivation. It can be hard to find motivation when you are surrounded by others with different interests or goals. But you never know \u2013 there might be someone around you who also wants to make changes but isn\u2019t sure how to get started. The first step to finding support is sharing your desire to move more or eat differently with friends and family. Ask for their support. You might find someone to join you on a walk or help you swap out unhealthy food for healthier ones in family meals. Ask a friend to join you in a fun regular activity like taking the dog for a walk or exploring local parks in your neighborhood. **The science behind social support** Social support can make a big difference in adopting and keeping a healthy lifestyle. A2021 studyof adults 45 and older found that social support plays a large role in our dietary behaviors when we are trying to make a healthy change. If those in your circle aren\u2019t on the same path, look again to your local community center or organization. They might have walking or fitness groups that are free to join and allow you to meet others with similar goals. **Feelings of discomfort** Feelings of discomfort canimpacthealthy habits in different ways. People with obesity might experience weight stigma, which someresearchshows can lead to increased food consumption. Those for whom exercise doesn\u2019t come easily might find it hard to get started and may not know where to begin. However, it\u2019s important to remember that discomfort isn\u2019t something to be feared or avoided. In fact, embracing these feelings can be a powerful tool for growth. For instance, a2022 studyinvolving over 2,000 adults found that those who viewed discomfort as a sign of growth and actively sought it out became more engaged and experienced a stronger sense of achievement in their goals. By embracing discomfort, we open ourselves to greater motivation and resilience, better equipping us to tackle the challenges that come with weight loss and other personal growth goals. **Takeaway** Lack of time, lack of support, and high costs are all barriers to eating better and exercising more. But, there are ways you can begin to make healthy changes by looking for lower cost options and making small adjustments in how you use your time. Look to friends and family for support or local community groups for companionship and inspiration. **How we reviewed this article:** Arlinghaus KR, et al. (2019).
