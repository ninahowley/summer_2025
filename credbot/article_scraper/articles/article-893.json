But the ringer is Michael Cera, reason enough to see this occasionally frustrating movie again.** **Share this:** Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Facebook Click to share on X (Opens in new window)X Click to print (Opens in new window)Print A peculiar tension exists inside nearly every frame created by writer-director Wes Anderson. The geometric visual preoccupation of the framing; the actors, sometimes in motion but more frequently motionless; the manifestation of storytelling as a series of the prettiest shoebox dioramas in modern cinema: It\u2019s more than a style or a look to Anderson. It\u2019s his way of seeing the world through a lens of comic stoicism, right at the edge of art-installation territory. **Related Articles** Movie Review: \u2018How to Train Your Dragon\u2019 might have just redeemed the live-action adaptation \u2018Life of Chuck\u2019 review: It\u2019s a wonderful, apocalyptic life in Stephen King land Movie review: Ana de Armas is better at killing than ballet in \u2018Ballerina,\u2019 a John Wick spinoff Top 10 summer movies: \u2018Fantastic Four,\u2019 meet \u2018Jurassic Park 7\u2019 and the new man from Krypton Column: How \u2018Jaws\u2019 changed our chumminess with swimming 50 years ago this summer The tension in those images comes from two places. The unfortunate place: When the comic banter or monologuing strains for laughs, or goes sideways, it sometimes dies an extra, tiny, momentary death because of the arch, extreme formality of the presentation. The more fortunate source of tension is where the actors live. In Anderson\u2019s lavishly talented ensembles, the majority of the performers fulfill the basic requirements of being in a Wes Anderson movie, which can involve spitting out long reams of dialogue quickly, directly, without a lot of sauce. It also involves the task of portraying a human in a specific realm of unreality and in a kind of permanent repose, even in motion. But hitting the marks and holding the pose isn\u2019t enough. There\u2019s movement, of course, in every Anderson comedy, and in the best ones, the movement and the sight gags are funnier because of the stillness surrounding that movement. Whatever you want to call Anderson\u2019s universe \u2014 I\u2019ll go with Deadpandia \u2014 it\u2019s not easy to activate as a performer. When the right actor wriggles free of the constraints and finds a rhythm, a heartbeat and a human spark, it\u2019s magic. Benicio Del Toro is the star of \u201cThe Phoenician Scheme,\u201d Anderson\u2019s 12th and latest. But the ringer is Michael Cera, as Norwegian tutor Bj\u00f8rn Lund, employed as an all-purpose factotum by the shady, swaggering, death-defying entrepreneur played by Del Toro. In one go, Cera joins the top tier of Anderson alums, which includesRalph Fiennes(\u201cThe Grand Budapest Hotel,\u201d \u201cThe Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar\u201d) and, from Anderson\u2019s earlier, looser years,Gene Hackman and Anjelica Huston(\u201cThe Royal Tenenbaums\u201d) and, of course, Bill Murray in everything (he has a brief cameo here, as God). Cera is terrifically subtle in everything he does, from pricelessly cheap dialect humor to sudden bursts of jealousy. He\u2019s delightful, even if \u201cThe Phoenician Scheme\u201d is only occasionally that. The movie\u2019s largely about other characters. A frequent target of assassins, forever surviving plane crashes in between business deals, Anatole \u201cZsa-zsa\u201d Korda (Del Toro) embarks on the riskiest development project of his life, indicated by Anderson\u2019s title. It consists of a dam, tunnels, a canal and a general colonialist ravaging of a desert region (fictional, but with plenty of real-world Middle Eastern inspirations). Funding this beast means negotiating with several investors, among them a French nightclub owner (Mathieu Amalric), a pair of American industrialists (Tom Hanks, Bryan Cranston) and, above all, Korda\u2019s estranged daughter, Liesl, a cynical novitiate and Korda\u2019s intended heiress, played by Mia Threapleton. \u201cThe Phoenician Scheme\u201d is a tale of what money can buy, and what money can\u2019t. Stringing episodes together, screenwriter Anderson (working from a story co-created by Roman Coppola) treats Korda as a cocky survivor of fabulous riches. Through his adventures in fundraising, and realization that he won\u2019t last forever, Korda learns from Liesl a little about what makes a legacy important. Meantime, he negotiates family matters with his 10 young sons and his scowling brother, Uncle Nubar (Benedict Cumberbatch), who may be Liesl\u2019s father, and whose massive woodcut of a beard comes straight from Orson Welles\u2019 billionaire in \u201cMr. Arkadin.\u201d The overall vibe of fishy exoticism owes something to \u201cMr. Arkadin\u201d as well. Anderson works here with a cinematographer new to him, the excellent Bruno Delbonnel, shooting on 35mm film. Anderson regulars Adam Stockhausen (production design, first-rate) and Milena Canonero (costume design, brilliant and vibrant as always) evoke a dreamlike 1950s setting in every soundstage-bound detail. And the story? Well, it has a little problem with over-elaboration. \u201cThe Phoenician Scheme\u201d follows a relatively straightforward narrative line, ticking off chapters as Korda addresses each of his prized (and literal) shoeboxes of research and minutiae regarding the massively disruptive, slave labor-dependent construction project. It\u2019s easier to parse what\u2019s going on here compared to the hyperlinking and layering of \u201cThe French Dispatch\u201d and \u201cAsteroid City.\u201d But the protagonist is a bit of a bore. And somehow, right now, on planet Earth in 2025, a movie about a craven oligarch on a spree hits a mixed chord, let\u2019s say. It is, however, striking to see what happens in the epilogue of this up-and-down Anderson film, when Del Toro \u2014 who looks splendid but struggles to locate a lightness of touch the material could use \u2014 finally gets a few moments of on-screen relaxation in the epilogue. That\u2019s by design: He is not the same person at the end of his story. But I wonder if Anderson erred in maintaining such a tight hold on Del Toro and Threapleton en route to the story destination. A beautiful mixed bag, let\u2019s say, all told. But I\u2019ll see \u201cThe Phoenician Scheme\u201d a second time sometime for Cera, who will surely return to the Anderson fold. \u201cThe Phoenician Scheme\u201d \u2014 2.5 stars (out of 4) MPA rating: PG-13 (for violent content, bloody images, some sexual material, nude images, and smoking throughout) Running time: 1:45 How to watch: Premieres in theaters June 6 Michael Phillips is a Tribune critic. **Share this:** Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Facebook Click to share on X (Opens in new window)X Click to print (Opens in new window)Print **RevContent Feed** **Most Popular** Sister Jane Kelly dies at age 95Sister Jane Kelly dies at age 95 **Sister Jane Kelly dies at age 95** **Sister Jane Kelly dies at age 95** Study finds little agreement between Republicans and Democrats on media sources they trustStudy finds little agreement between Republicans and Democrats on media sources they trust **Study finds little agreement between Republicans and Democrats on media sources they trust** **Study finds little agreement between Republicans and Democrats on media sources they trust** Louisiana lawmakers pass bill targeting out-of-state doctors who prescribe and mail abortion pillsLouisiana lawmakers pass bill targeting out-of-state doctors who prescribe and mail abortion pills **Louisiana lawmakers pass bill targeting out-of-state doctors who prescribe and mail abortion pills** **Louisiana lawmakers pass bill targeting out-of-state doctors who prescribe and mail abortion pills** Federal immigration raid at Omaha food production plant sparks protestsFederal immigration raid at Omaha food production plant sparks protests **Federal immigration raid at Omaha food production plant sparks protests** **Federal immigration raid at Omaha food production plant sparks protests** Urchin barrens: what is to be done?Urchin barrens: what is to be done? **Urchin barrens: what is to be done?** **Urchin barrens: what is to be done?** MCSO: Suspect dies during incident on Hearst Willits RoadMCSO: Suspect dies during incident on Hearst Willits Road **MCSO: Suspect dies during incident on Hearst Willits Road** **MCSO: Suspect dies during incident on Hearst Willits Road** \u2018The Better Sister\u2019 review: Estranged sisters reunite after a husband is murdered.
