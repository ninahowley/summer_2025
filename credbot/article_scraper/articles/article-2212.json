Whether you go for a chain restaurant\u2019s happy hour shrimp boil or a pricey plate of \u201cshrimp a la grandioso\u201d at President Donald Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort \u2014 a good question to ask is: Where do they get their shrimp? Even if the restaurant has an ocean view and a shrimp boat out front, chances are its crustaceans come from industrial aquaculture farms thousands of miles away in India, Ecuador, Vietnam and Indonesia. Astonishingly, our country now imports 94% of the shrimp we eat! Astonishing, because our oceans have an abundance of top-quality shrimp, and we are blessed with highly skilled shrimping families. Worse, those foreign industrial operations, financed by Wall Street andglobal profiteers, are infamous for using forced labor, banned antibiotics and destructive environmental methods. Then they dump their grossly cheap product into the U.S. market, pushing out our superior-quality domestic product and devastating entire shrimping communities. Yet, restaurant and supermarket prices for shrimp are at historic highs, with no disclosure to us consumers of where the product is from. The import industry effectively bribes lawmakers to avoid exposing, much less punishing, this multibillion-dollar swindle of American producers and eaters alike. The bait-and-switch conspiracy is now so pervasive that at last year\u2019s National Shrimp Festival, four out of five vendors were \u2013 Shhhh \u2014 quietly serving industrially-raised imported shrimp. Of course, corporations have no conscience, but our tough-on-crime political leaders are so pusillanimous that they won\u2019t even stand up for their own local shrimpers. A recent Louisiana law, for example, \u201cboldly\u201d requires restaurants to disclose if they\u2019re peddling imported shrimp. But, the legislature meekly provided \u201cno penalty\u201d if violators ignore the law. So \u2026 they do.

Here come those same politicians, putting on MAGA hard hats and firing up their political bulldozers to push one of the most arrogant and intrusive social schemes imaginable. They intend to re-engineer the American family! These \u201cpronatalists\u201d want families to conform to a Christian Nationalist family structure \u2014 specifically, a dominant man married to a subservient stay-at-home woman, having beaucoup children. Not a couple of kiddos but six, 12 or more! For example, extremist MAGA senator Josh Hawley has become a cheerleader for a federal policy to entice women to quit work, stay home and have more babies. He proposes a tax credit of $5,000 per child, gushing that this would cause working families to exclaim, \u201cOh, my gosh, we can actually raise our kids.\u201d Well, \u201cgosh\u201d right back at you, Josh! Just giving birth can cost more than $5,000 \u2014 and raising a child is multiples above that every year. So, you want to take away a mom\u2019s job and her income, and add thousands in costs to the family budget \u2014 in exchange for a government tax credit? The slickest loan sharks aren\u2019t that diabolical. Oh, wait. Right-wing pronatalists have another government incentive to jack up birth rates. Incredibly, Trump officials have proposed a \u201cNational Medal of Motherhood\u201d for women who have six or more children! Wow, what should that medal look like, be made of and say? And when and where should it be worn? Also, will un-medaled women be socially ostracized? If right-wingers actually wanted to help families, they\u2019d be backing family-level wages, free childcare and Medicare for all. Everything else is political BS.
