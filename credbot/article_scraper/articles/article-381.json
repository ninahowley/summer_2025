Jennie McDonough had been employed as a cook on the Binnaird Ranch in Mud Lake. The paper said she was \u201cevidently insane and more or less violent by spells.\u201d McDonough claimed to have two children in the orphan\u2019s home in Helena, Montana. \u201cSeparation from her children and an unhappy marriage seem to have unsettled her mind,\u201d the article reads. **1926-1950** REXBURG \u2014A two-year-old boy was miraculously rescued after being spotted floating in an irrigation ditch, The Rexburg Standard reported on June 9, 1932. The boy, the son of Mr. and Mrs. Furniss, who were visiting Mr. and Mrs. Dale Garner, of Rexburg, was rescued from a ditch on South First East. The mother reportedly didn\u2019t realize the child was missing until after the child had been rescued. The toddler floated through two or three culverts before he was pulled from the ditch by a passerby. That person then carried the child to a near-by hospital. \u201cThe child was breathing easily and sleeping deeply a few hours after the rescue,\u201d the paper said. \u201cHowever, it might be well for mothers to keep close watch on their small children when the city ditches are so full of water.\u201d **1951-1975** ASHTON \u2014A grizzly bear \u201cseverely mauled\u201d an Idaho Falls man and injured two teenagers, the Idaho State Journal reported on June 9, 1967. The state game warden Dale Barney of St. Anthony brought a pack of dogs from Preston into the timber north of Ashton where the search for the bear was underway. The search was focused in Idaho\u2019s Porcupine Forest District, west of Yellowstone National Park. Experienced trackers said the dogs faced a \u201ctough job\u201d as the trail was already two days old and there had since been rain. The U.S. Forest Service said the animal jumpedByrle Walker. Two youths, James Black, 14, and Kristan Sparks, 13, were staying with the timber workers and heard Walker\u2019s screams. They ran to him and were attacked as they tried to distract the bear. As the teenagers tried to chase the animal away with sticks, the bear snapped Black\u2019s right arm with its jaws and left deep bruises in Sparks\u2019 forearms. \u201cThe victims told authorities the attack was quick and ruthless,\u201d the article states. \u201cWalker was working a short distance from the two boys when he heard a noise. He turned and the bear charged.\u201d Walker was swatted to the ground. The bear then straddled him and began biting and ripping at him with its claws. Black said the bear knocked him over and he kept swinging a stick in its face. After he was bitten in several places, Black played dead and the grizzly left. Sparks said he thought Walker and Black were both dead. He ran three miles to get help. Walker was eventually taken to Ashton where the doctor who operated on him for more than four hours said, \u201cShe was out to kill him. He was ripped in pieces.\u201d The doctor also said Walker needed more than 300 stitches to close the wounds, adding that the father of five \u201chas muscle damage and will be disfigured.\u201d Authorities said that when the teenagers \u201cdrew the bear\u2019s attack on themselves\u201d they saved Walker\u2019s life. The teenagers were also hospitalized in Ashton but in less serious condition than Walker\u2019s. The forest service mentioned the bear may be the same one that attacked one of their rangers in the Porcupine area the year before. **1976-2000** POCATELLO \u2014A second-degree burglary charge was dropped against a 21-year-old Utah man, the Idaho State Journal reported on June 15, 1977. Shannon Richmond had been charged with the burglary of the Lava Drug Store that happened in June 1976. Sixth District Judge Arthur P. Oliver dropped the charge following a motion by Bannock County Prosecuting Attorney Garth Pincock. Pincock asked the charge against Richmond be dropped in \u201cthe interest of justice\u201d because all the evidence for the case was stolen from the Lava Hot Springs Police Department. No further information about the theft was published at that time. This story is brought to you byNewspapers.com, where a simple search of our newspaper archive transports you to the past.
