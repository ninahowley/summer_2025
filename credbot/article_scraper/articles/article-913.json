(AP) \u2014 In a single shift, Florida Panthers forward Sam Bennett showed why he\u2019s been one of the most unstoppable players in the Stanley Cup playoffs. In Game 3 of the Stanley Cup Final, Bennett knocked Vasily Podkolzin off his feet with a huge hit in the defensive zone, then buried a breakaway goal on the other end moments later. After the goal, which put the Florida Panthers up 4-1 in the second period of an eventual 6-1 rout of the Edmonton Oilers on Monday night, Bennett pumped his fist and hugged teammate Matthew Tkachuk, whose mouth was wide open, as if neither could believe what had just happened. That\u2019s who Bennett has been throughout the postseason \u2014 a hard-hitting, goal-guzzling centerpiece to Florida\u2019s third straight run to the Stanley Cup Final. And after another standout performance that strengthened his case for winning the Conn Smythe Trophy given to the playoff MVP, Bennett has the Panthers two wins away from hoisting a championship trophy for the second straight season. \u201cHe\u2019s been an animal this whole playoffs. He\u2019s built for this time of year,\u201d said Brad Marchand, who opened scoring Monday with his eighth goal of the postseason. \u201cJust how competitive he is and how intense. Obviously you see the physicality piece. That shift was a perfect example of his game. He blows two guys up and then somehow leads the rush after that and scores a beautiful goal.\u201d \u201cHe can do it all,\u201d Marchand continued. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t get fazed. He competes and battles and he\u2019s not scared to go to the dirty areas. \u2026 When you get in this time of year, you have to be able to go into the dirty areas, and he lives there.\u201d Marchand had so many positive things to say about Bennett\u2019s game that his teammate, Sam Reinhart, nudged him during their postgame media session to finish up his answer. \u201cSorry, I\u2019ve got to wrap it up,\u201d Marchand quipped. \u201cBut he\u2019s been great.\u201d Bennett had 51 points (25 goals, 26 assists) during the regular season, which was fifth on the team. His 20 postseason points lead the Panthers, and he has more goals \u2014 14 \u2014 than any other player in the playoffs. He\u2019s also scored in each of the first three games of the Cup final. Bennett had two goals in Florida\u2019s 4-3 overtime loss at Edmonton in the series opener and opened scoring just two minutes into the Panthers\u2019 5-4 double overtime win in Game 2. \u201cHe\u2019s been incredible,\u201d said Panthers captain Aleksander Barkov. \u201cObviously he\u2019s scoring goals, but he\u2019s doing so much more other stuff. He\u2019s carrying the puck in the neutral zone. He\u2019s making plays. He\u2019s defending well. He\u2019s just unreal right now.\u201d Bennett\u2019s breakaway goal, which came on an assist from Eetu Luostarinen on Monday, stretched his goal streak to four games, which is a Panthers\u2019 postseason record. \u201cThat goal was the perfect Benny goal,\u201d said Tkachuk said, \u201clays a big hit. (Luostarinen) makes a great block, springs Benny for a breakaway and a great goal.\u201d Bennett\u2019s playoff scoring surge couldn\u2019t have come at a better time, with the 28-year-old set to hit free agency at the end of the season. Panthers coach Paul Maurice, fully aware of Bennett\u2019s pending free agency, made sure to issue a warning to any teams interested in his squad\u2019s leading postseason scorer. \u201cHorrible attitude,\u201d Maurice quipped during a midgame television interview. \u201cI think he\u2019s got bubonic plague. Dengue fever. He\u2019s got a whole bunch of things. We\u2019re not sure he can be cured.\u201d **Newsletter** **National Sports** **National Sports** **Matt Vogt once chose dentistry over golf.
