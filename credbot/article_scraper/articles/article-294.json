Nick\u2019s an old comrade of ours from his work on Marie Newman\u2019s campaigns. He told Chicago voters that \u201cRight now, we have a president who pits people against each other and encourages hate and division and an incumbent Senator who has faced numerous calls for her resignation because of her frequent racist and Islamophobic remarks. We deserve better. We, as Democrats, cannot expect to escape the mess our party is in by electing people who seek to divide rather than unite. I\u2019m running for the state Senate to bring people together and help build people up-\u2013 no matter where they live, who they love, or where they were born. We need new energetic leadership so we can get back to making this a fabulous place to live, work, and play for everyone. I believe we can have a better future if we elect leaders who aren\u2019t afraid to fight for that future.\u201d Please consider . If he wins he\u2019d be only the second openly gay person to serve in the Illinois Senate, and the first openly gay state Senator to represent one of the largest LGBTQ+ communities in the country, Northalsted. **Progress Means Building\u2014 Not Just Talking About It-by Nick Uniejewski** I\u2019m running against the incumbent in the Democratic primary. In fact, that seat\u2019s been locked down for decades. My opponent has served in Springfield for 30 years without ever facing a primary. And the 6th District hasn\u2019t seen a contested election since 1972.That\u2019s over 50 years without a real choice. I\u2019m running because that\u2019s not democracy\u2014 and it\u2019s certainly not progress. I\u2019m not interested in being a career politician. I\u2019m a community organizer, a policy nerd, and a public transit rider. I worked alongside former Congresswoman Marie Newman, fighting to put people\u2014 not corporations\u2014 at the center of politics. And I\u2019m running for State Senate because we need to get serious about the things that make life better for working people in Illinois: housing, transit, and democracy that can\u2019t be bought. Housing: Affordability Is Not a Luxury We\u2019re in a housing crisis\u2014 let\u2019s stop pretending otherwise. Rents are rising faster than wages. Families are being priced out of their neighborhoods. We all should be able to live in the communities we love without the fear of being priced out. As a Senator, I\u2019ll push for: Legalizing multi-family housing and accessory dwelling units (ADUs) so we can build more homes where people want to live Reforming the zoning and permitting process so it serves people, not just developers or NIMBY interests Prioritizing state investments in affordable housing\u2014 not giveaways to luxury condos Transit: Safe, Reliable, and Built for the Future I don\u2019t own a car. I bike. I walk. I take the CTA and Metra. And like many of you, I\u2019ve waited in the freezing rain wondering if the bus is ever coming. We need a 21st-century transit system that reflects our values: clean, accessible, and equitable. I\u2019ll fight for: Real, recurring funding for CTA, Metra, and Pace\u2014 without balancing the budget on riders\u2019 backs Protected bike and bus lanes to speed up commutes and reduce car dependence Regional coordination that treats transit like the public good it is\u2014not just a budget line to cut **Recent Posts** \"Moms 4 Liberty\" is Daughters of the Confederacy 2.0.
