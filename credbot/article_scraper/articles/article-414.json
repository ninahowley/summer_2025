The suspect has been charged with three counts of attempted murder, as well as a single count of shooting into an occupied vehicle. LCSO said the suspect \u201cwas found in possession of a loaded pistol, two additional loaded magazines, and was wearing a bullet-resistant vest beneath an Outcast Motorcycle Club vest\u201d at the time of his arrest. \u201cThis reckless violence has no place on our highways,\u201d said Limestone County Joshua Sheriff McLaughlin in the statement. \u201cWe are thankful no innocent lives were lost, and we will continue to work closely with our law enforcement partners to ensure the public\u2019s safety.\u201d No bond had been set for the suspect as of Sunday.
