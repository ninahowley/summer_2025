From purchases of large farmlands near sensitive military sites to influencing academic institutions and commandeering political influence, there is clear reason to view this behavior as a very real threat. Now, some states are beginning to push back against this quiet takeover, and Arkansas Republicans are leading the charge for the rest of the country. Republican legislators are sending a clear message and setting a blueprint for others to follow in ensuring foreign entities have no foothold in Arkansas or any other state. One of the most powerful tools for long-term defense against foreign influence is in education. Arkansas Republicans took a bold step with Act 134, which mandates instruction in elementary schools on the resilience of the U.S. constitutional republic and the failures of communist and autocratic systems. Act 473 requires disclosure and approval of major foreign contracts, vetting of foreign researchers, and limits on cultural exchanges and travel in state universities. We have also banned Confucius Institutes and restricted sister-city ties with adversarial nations under Act 937. These legislative achievements mark more than a much-needed curriculum update and improvement in transparency; they relay a strong message to our adversaries. In teaching Americans about the dangers of authoritarian ideologies, Arkansas is equipping the next generation with the historical and civic understanding they need to recognize and resist foreign propaganda that undermines our freedoms and values. In a time when many classrooms actively shy away from discussing the destructive nature of regimes, Arkansas is standing firm in defense of truth. Foreign influence isn\u2019t always public-facing. Often, it disguises itself in campaign contributions, deceptive ads, and ballot initiatives. Arkansas has taken decisive steps to close these loopholes and draw a line against such influence. Act 999 prohibits foreign entities from funding state and local ballot measures and strengthens disclosure requirements for campaign-related communications. This ensures that Arkansans, not adversarial powers, are the ones deciding their laws. In addition, Act 998 requires individuals and organizations acting on behalf of hostile foreign principals to register and disclose their political activities and financial contributions. Transparency is a critical weapon in the battle against covert interference, and these measures expose efforts to buy political influence from the shadows. Arkansas Republicans are working to cut economic dependencies that give hostile nations leverage over our institutions. Act 943 bans state agencies from purchasing promotional items manufactured in China, a clear signal that Arkansas is driving an America First agenda and dollars will not be used to subsidize adversarial economies. Act 937 subsequently requires public investment entities to divest from Chinese companies and submit annual reports verifying compliance. These laws safeguard state resources and create momentum for a broader movement toward economic independence from nations that do not share our values. The battle for America\u2019s sovereignty is no longer solely fought overseas; it\u2019s a fight unfolding in our classrooms, our elections, our universities, and our economy, and Arkansas is showing the nation how to take action. By enacting some of the strongest protections in the country against foreign influence, Arkansas Republicans have built a model of leadership grounded in oversight, transparency, and commitment to American values, and other states have taken note. Texas has passed laws banning Chinese citizens and entities from purchasing land near military installations; Florida has cracked down on the influence of Confucius Institutes and strengthened restrictions on foreign gifts to universities; and Oklahoma is investigating foreign land ownership tied to illicit activity. These efforts reflect a growing recognition that the threats we face are real and immediate. The federal government and the remaining states would do well to follow our lead.
