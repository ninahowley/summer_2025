Yikes! We knew these guys hated each other, but who knew they\u2019d take it this far. In a series of posts to X, Musk wrote, \u201cI didn\u2019t want it to come to this, but the world needs to know just what kind of a man Donald Trump is. I\u2019ve compiled all the evidence I could find proving Trump was once close friends with none other than ELON MUSK. This was NOT a \u2018business relationship\u2019 or a casual acquaintanceship. This man actually RESPECTED Elon Musk and considered him a CLOSE friend.\u201d The shocking and undoubtedly damaging revelation by Musk was followed up with numerous screen caps of personal conversations between Trump and Musk, photos of them together in various venues, and clips from interviews, some of them quite recent, where Trump has praised Elon Musk, calling him \u201cvery smart\u201d and \u201ca great guy.\u201d Elon followed the damning proof that Trump was once quite close to Elon Musk with another post stating, \u201cHow anyone can continue to trust this man after seeing what I just shared is beyond me. Trump\u2019s past friendship with Elon Musk is inexcusable, and I don\u2019t care who knows about it, even if revealing this causes his downfall.\u201d Dang. Not only is Elon dropping the bombshell that Trump was once friends with Elon Musk, but he\u2019s bringing receipts! Looks like \u201cTeflon Don\u201d may have finally found himself in a situation he can\u2019t bounce back from. One thing\u2019s for sure, Trump is going to be in full defensive meltdown mode when he responds to this, and it\u2019s going to be interesting to see how he tries to explain it away. We didn\u2019t know Elon had it in him to deliver a blow like this to Trump. This is simply as nasty as a public feud can get.
