He\u00e2\u0080\u0099d been on location in Martha\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Vineyard for three months, waiting for the overdue star of his new movieJaws. And now, as he watched the first lunges of the $250,000 mechanical shark in action, Spielberg\u00e2\u0080\u0099s heart sank. The beast was anything but menacing. His eyes crossed. His teeth were too white. His jaws didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t close properly. And he had a big dimple that made him look like Kirk Douglas. The shark was just the latest of Spielberg\u00e2\u0080\u0099s setbacks. BeforeJaws, movies weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t shot on the ocean. Hollywood studios simply tossed a boat in a tank and projected moving scenery behind it. But Spielberg wanted realism. And he paid for it. Boating mishaps and near drownings had almost killed several cast and crew members. Rough waters and drifting tides made for chaotic filming. Most days, once the crew had anchored the 12 tons of rigging into place and waited out unwanted boats on the horizon, Spielberg was left with just two hours of afternoon light to shoot. As Spielberg burned through his $4 million budget and 55-day shooting schedule, the cast and crew turned mutinous. Angry locals left dead sharks on the production office\u00e2\u0080\u0099s porch. Studio execs worried the film wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t deliver. And Spielberg lived in constant fear of having the plug pulled. Word in Hollywood was that the young director was finished. But Spielberg, who felt \u00e2\u0080\u009clike Captain Bligh\u00e2\u0080\u009d on a sinking ship, was determined to complete his movie, shark or no shark. A Picture Book of Fears What Would Hitchcock Do? Bruce\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Legacy **A Picture Book of Fears** When a Long Island fisherman caught a 4500-poundgreat whitein 1964, author Peter Benchley took notice. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat would happen if one of those things came around and wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go away?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he asked. Ten years later he turned the idea into thebestselling novelJaws. Benchley\u00e2\u0080\u0099s book sparked an immediate bidding war in Hollywood, with Universal coming out on top\u00e2\u0080\u0094all before it even hit shelves. Spielberg wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the studio\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first choice as director. Universal initially approached Dick Richards, but when Richards kept referring to the story\u00e2\u0080\u0099s predator as a \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhale,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the producers lost patience. Enter the young and ambitious Steven Spielberg. His r\u00c3\u00a9sum\u00c3\u00a9 included more TV movies and episodes ofColumbothan feature films. And his one stab at the big screen,The Sugarland Express, had drawn critical raves but tanked at the box office. Still, the suits were impressed by his confidence. Spielberg\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vision forJawswas part high adventure, part horror: \u00e2\u0080\u009ca picture book of fears, phobias and anxieties.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Spielberg had his own doubts about the project. As a new director, he had art-house aspirations and dreamed of making critically acclaimed films. But he knew that one more flop would torpedo his career. He had to makeJawsa blockbuster. To do that, he needed a truly terrifying shark. Producers wanted Spielberg to hire someone to train a great white\u00e2\u0080\u0094an impossibility. The director toyed with rubber props before ultimately deciding the only real answer was to build a remote-controlled mega-shark\u00e2\u0080\u0094a 25-footer that could swim, leap in the air, and munch on human prey. Every special effects company in Hollywood called the task impossible. Undeterred, Spielberg lured effects guru Bob Mattey out of retirement. Famous for designing the giant squid in the 1954 film20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, Mattey assured the director he could build the perfect monster. With three sharks in production (collectively nicknamed Bruce, after Spielberg\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lawyer), Spielberg focused on the screenplay, which had gone through four writers and five drafts. The script was still unfinished as shooting began, so Spielberg hired his friend Carl Gottlieb to do the final polishing on set. Though it made the studio nervous to use a sitcom writer whose credits includedThe Odd CoupleandAll in the Family, Gottlieb proved to be one of the movie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s secret weapons. Each night he sat with stars Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss, and Robert Shaw, taking notes as they improvised unfinished scenes. In Gottlieb\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hands, a straight monster flick became a character-driven film. And many of the flick\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most memorable lines\u00e2\u0080\u0094including \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099re gonna need a biggerboat\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094came out of his process. During the first three months of production, Spielberg focused on bringing fictional Amity Island to life. Whether orchestrating hundreds of extras through a beach panic scene or refereeing an off-screen battle of egos between Shaw and Dreyfuss, the director remained calm and confident. But as he prepared to take his cameras onto the high seas, one question remained: Where was the shark? **What Would Hitchcock Do?** When Mattey finally delivered Bruce, Spielberg began to panic. On its first day on the job, the shark promptly sank to the bottom of Nantucket Sound. Within a week, saltwater had eroded Bruce\u00e2\u0080\u0099s electric motor, and he had to be refitted with a system of pneumatic hoses. Every night, Bruce also had to be drained, scrubbed, and repainted. Even by diva standards, Bruce was high-maintenance. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI had no choice but to figure out how to tell the story without the shark,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Spielberg said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo I just went back toAlfred Hitchcock: \u00e2\u0080\u0098What would Hitchcock do in a situation like this?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 ... It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see which is truly frightening.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The idea of the unseen enemy completely changed the film\u00e2\u0080\u0099s direction. It shapes the opening scene where a girl goes for a midnight swim and becomes the shark\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first victim. We see her legs underwater. We hear the ominous notes of John Williams\u00e2\u0080\u0099s score. And then we watch as she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s yanked down and dragged violently through the sea. The crew achieved this terrifying effect by tying ropes around actress Susan Backlinie, then playing a game of aquatic tug-of-war. The sidelined shark also prompted Spielberg\u00e2\u0080\u0099s creative use of the ocean itself. He wanted the water lapping at the lens to make the audience feel like they were not only \u00e2\u0080\u009cin the ocean, but about to drown.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Cameraman Bill Butler invented a \u00e2\u0080\u009cwater box\u00e2\u0080\u009d with glass windows that allowed cameras to be submerged. Gottlieb deepened the constant state of anxiety by stirring humor into the horror. Almost every appearance of the shark comes directly on the heels of a joke\u00e2\u0080\u0094the careful orchestration of screams, laughs, and foreboding silence keeps the audience emotionally off balance. An exhausted Spielberg finally returned to Hollywood 159 days and nearly $8 million later. But his work wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t over. With the help of veteran editor Verna \u00e2\u0080\u009cMother Cutter\u00e2\u0080\u009d Fields, he pieced the movie together. The New England weather haunted him\u00e2\u0080\u0094the wildly varying light and changing skies made for endless headaches as they matched footage. Massive reels of Bruce had to be cobbled into cohesive bursts of terror. To add an extra scare, Spielberg reshot part of one scene in Fields\u00e2\u0080\u0099s backyard pool, dumping powdered milk in the water to approximate the murky ocean. But even after finalizing the film, Spielberg doubted the results. Would his shark movie scare audiences, or would it be the \u00e2\u0080\u009claugh riot of \u00e2\u0080\u009975\u00e2\u0080\u009d? **Bruce\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Legacy** Spielberg didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know it, but his malfunctioning sharks were about to radically alter Hollywood\u00e2\u0080\u0099s business model. All the shooting delays meant thatJawscouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hit its planned release date, right in the heart of 1974\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lucrative Christmas season. Instead, Universal made the gutsy call to hold the film until summer, a season that had traditionally been the dumping ground for cinematic afterthoughts. Then something unbelievable happened. Test screenings that spring drew such positive reactions that MCA/Universal\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stock price shot up by several points. Certain that it had a hit, Universal seized the momentum with a marketing blitz. Studios had always shied away from using expensive television spots to market films, but Universal dropped an unheard-of $700,000 to saturate prime-time programming with 30-second trailers. The opening strategy was equally aggressive. Traditionally, high-profile movies opened in New York City or Los Angeles before slowly spreading to other cities and then trickling into small towns months later. Wide releases were generally reserved for duds; studios would cast a wide net to maximize ticket sales before negative word of mouth killed a film. But after the ad campaign madeJawsthe summer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t-miss flick, Universal went all-in on the release, and the movie opened in an unprecedented 465 theaters on June 20, 1975. The gambles paid off\u00e2\u0080\u0094Jawsgrossed $60 million in its first month. It went on to become the first film to top $100 million, eventually hauling in an astonishing $260 million. Critics were just as enthusiastic.The New Yorker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Pauline Kael dubbed it \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe most cheerfully perverse scare movie ever made.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The film was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture, and it won three other Oscars. Spielberg would later say, \u00e2\u0080\u009cJawsshould never have been made\u00e2\u0080\u0094it was an impossible effort.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Yet all those frustrating days at sea and short-circuiting sharks got the young director exactly what he had always wanted. By creating the prototype for every summer blockbuster that followed, Spielberg earned the freedom to make artier films likeThe Color PurpleandSchindler\u00e2\u0080\u0099s List. He went into his next project,Close Encounters of the Third Kind, armed with a bigger budget, more creative control, and the knowledge that sometimes the biggest obstacles were actually his biggest assets.
