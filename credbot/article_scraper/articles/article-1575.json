The military activation comes after objections from California\u2019s governor and local leaders who contend the protests in the country\u2019s second-largest city were mostly peaceful. Gov. Gavin Newsom is asking the courts to intervene andhalt broad National Guard deploymentin his state. \u201cPersonally, I don\u2019t like to see military personnel deployed within our states because we\u2019re trained for foreign adversaries,\u201d said George MacMasters, a combat veteran with two decades of service in the U.S. Marines and Army. \u201cSure, we\u2019ve taken an oath to protect the Constitution from foreign and domestic threats, but it just strikes me as more third world\u2013type behavior.\u201d MacMasters, a Watertown resident who served in Guantanamo Bay, Iraq and Afghanistan, believes there is an urgent need to address immigration policy in the United States \u2014 but he doesn\u2019t believe it\u2019s a military issue. \u201cIt needs to be addressed by Congress. They need to finally sit down and work together and come up with a comprehensive plan, how to deal humanely with the millions of immigrants that have come to this country,\u201d he said. Boston-area veterans like MacMasters \u2014 at the nonprofit Operation American Soldier in Watertown, the Dedham VFW organization and a grocery store in Westwood that offers a discount to veterans \u2014 are concerned about how the military is being used. Paul Nascenzi, of Sharon, was a member of the Norwood National Guard for six years during the Vietnam War. He was never activated but trained for years knowing he raised his right hand to serve and protect the country. \u201cWhen they tell us to do what you do, you follow orders. Whatever the orders are \u2014 when your superiors tell you to do, you do,\u201d Nascenzi said. He didn\u2019t want to specifically talk about the Trump order but says he would only support the use of military as a last resort to ensure public safety. U.S. Marine veteran Bruce Collins, of Quincy, said the military can have an effective role on domestic soil if the need rises to the point where community safety is at risk. \u201cThey should use some soldiers,\u201d he said. In this case, though, Collins said he does not have enough information about Trump\u2019s decision to have an opinion if the National Guard is the most effective response. But he said the military has been an effective response tool historically, citing an incident in 1965 involving civil unrest in the Watts neighborhood of Los Angles sparked by police brutality. \u201cIf it was a riot, like the Watts riot or something like that, then that\u2019s a different story,\u201d he said. \u201cThen combat soldiers have to go there.\u201d Collins pointed out \u2014 military training is far different than police training, so any activation has to be a last resort. \u201cA lot of us are trained as riflemen. I could shoot 500 yards and kill somebody. That\u2019s the whole idea of it,\u201d he said. MacMasters said the country will always agree to disagree but he is convinced the American process still works. \u201cI\u2019m very thankful for our Constitution because it gives us the right to free speech and the right to assemble peacefully. And that\u2019s the key. I think too many people forget that.\u201d rgoulston robertgoulstonnews RobertGoulstonReporter robert.goulston@gbh.org **Explore Topics:** **Subscribe to GBH Daily** Your essential daily newsletter delivering trusted news, local insights, ways to connect, and can't miss programs from Boston and beyond.
