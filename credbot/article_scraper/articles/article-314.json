for impeachment** **Share this:** Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Facebook Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)Reddit Click to share on X (Opens in new window)X I\u2019m still trying to process that Taishya Adams put her own personal politics in front of her compassion and support for our community. We experienced an awful, horrendous act of terrorism recently \u2014 an illegal alien literally threw Molotov bombs, burning our citizens, some of whom were in their 80s. What a nightmare! Our city council tried to come together to denounce this despicable act and to express support and love and compassion to our community. Our City Council members are representatives of the HEARTS and minds of our citizens. But, apparently, not Taishya Adams! She does not represent who we are as a city. When our city has experienced tragedies, we come together as a community. We show our love and compassion and support, firstly to the families affected by the tragedy, and then to the community as a whole. Instead, Taishya Adams went petty, trying to wordsmith a City Council statement denouncing the attack and refused to sign. She does not represent me, and I don\u2019t think she represents the majority of citizens of Boulder. Paul Perlmutter, Boulder As a Jewish resident of Boulder who is appalled by what Netanyahu and Israel are doing in Gaza, I would like to acknowledge Taisha Adams for her insistence on maintaining the critical distinction between antisemitism and anti-zionism. While the perpetrator of the Pearl Street mall attack may well qualify for either or both descriptors, and while I might disagree with some of Ms. Adams\u2019 other positions, it is absolutely crucial that we, the American public, do not conflate antisemitism and anti-zionism. It is also crucial that those of us concerned about the situation in Gaza find ways to build bridges when we encounter points of agreement. Elyse Morgan, Boulder A while back, a friend sent me this quote from Alexander Hamilton, one of the founding fathers of the United States: \u201cWhen a man unprincipled in private life, desperate in his fortune, bold in his temper \u2026 despotic in his ordinary demeanour \u2014 known to have scoffed in private at the principles of liberty \u2014 when such a man is seen to mount the hobby horse of popularity \u2014 to join in the cry of danger to liberty \u2014 to take every opportunity of embarrassing the General Government & bringing it under suspicion \u2014 to flatter and fall in with all the non sense of the zealots of the day \u2014 It may justly be suspected that his object is to throw things into confusion that he may \u2018ride the storm and direct the whirlwind.\u2019\u201d Hamilton made this statement in support of having a provision for impeachment in the U.S. Constitution. Does this description call anyone to mind? Rep. Adam Schiff also quoted this passage at the second impeachment trial of Donald Trump, after the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the Capitol. It\u2019s interesting that Elon Musk is now criticizing Trump\u2019s \u201cbig, beautiful bill\u201d and calling for Trump\u2019s impeachment. Trump was the first president to be impeached twice; could it happen a third time? We can only hope. Cherry Sokoloski, Loveland The Camera has several positions open on the Community Editorial Board and is inviting local writers to apply. The CEB members are volunteers who write every other week on topics of local interest that are selected by the Camera Editorial Board. Applicants may send a resume of writing and/or general educational and work experience, a cover letter about why they are interested in joining the CEB and writing samples. Writing samples can include letters to the editor or guest opinions that have been published in any paper, or a 300- to 400-word essay on a recent CEB topic or a local issue. Applicants must live in Boulder and should not be members of groups that are politically active in Boulder or Boulder County. Applicants should include a telephone number, and finalists will be contacted to take part in brief interviews.
