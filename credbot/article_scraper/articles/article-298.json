Securing these resources demands a bold, modern strategy\u2013one that is market-led, environmentally and socially responsible, builds capacity in both production and processing, and works with allies while also forging new geopolitical alliances with resource-rich Global South countries. The Critical Minerals Security Program will build upon CSIS\u2019s longstanding work with policymakers on both sides of the aisle to support market-led efforts to expand production and processing capabilities to improve domestic and global security. With a new paradigm, the United States can enable its diplomats, policymakers, and private sector actors to develop a secure supply chain and meet the mineral needs of the 21st century. **Meet Our Experts** Meet our network of experts, staff, and non-resident affiliates who contribute to our Critical Minerals Security Program's Analysis Stay up to date on the latest fromCritical Minerals Security Program The CSIS Critical Minerals Security Program's weekly newsletter.
