The end of the show was heartfelt, and saw Marcus head off to rehab after struggling with alcohol addiction. During the touching scene, Marcus was being driven away. He then noticed he had a copy of Ginny\u2019s poem, Sunshine, and it was read out. From day one we\u2019ve all backed Marcus and Ginny, and now the creator has spoken out what this scene means as Ginny and Georgia heads into the next seasons, beyond season three. Speaking to Screenrant, creator Sarah Lampert broke down the moment. She said the Sunshine poem \u201creally represents where [Ginny and Marcus are] at right now.\u201d She explained Ginny being able to see his sunshine during such a dark moment is symbolic of the hope we have for them as a couple, and their strength. via Netflix \u201cI had the \u2018Sunshine\u2019 poem kicking around for a few years now, and I was just waiting for the right moment to place it,\u201d she explained. \u201cAnd to me, that really represents where they\u2019re at right now. She sees his sunshine through the dark, and I think that it\u2019s very much a place of hope. \u201cBut also a place of hopelessness because Marcus is on his way to rehab. We see that, but we also see that he doesn\u2019t feel he belongs there. And I just don\u2019t think, unless something changes while he\u2019s there, that he is in a place to really confront what he\u2019s struggling with and make progress and get better until he himself wants to do that.\u201d **Most Read** **Bonnie Blue cancels her extreme \u2018petting zoo\u2019 event, and reveals its grim replacement** **The best 20 unis in the UK right now, according to the new Complete University Guide** **22-year-old who did vile stunt with Bonnie Blue says she\u2019s \u2018traumatised\u2019 and needs therapy** This hints that brighter days might be to come for Ginny and Marcus, as the show continues. But, that doesn\u2019t mean it won\u2019t come without struggles. Sarah Lampert explained Marcus struggles to confront his problems, which may still stand in his way when it comes to his relationship with Ginny. So, moving forward I think we can definitely say Ginny and Marcus will push for their relationship. But, it was never going to be easy. Ginny and Georgia is available on Netflix now.
