jurisdictions\u2019 list identifying several Colorado municipalities, counties** News|Jun 7, 2025 ateres-martinez@steamboatpilot.com The Department of Homeland Security\u2019s list of \u201csanctuary jurisdictions\u201d \u2014 which listed several cities and counties on Colorado\u2019s Western Slope \u2014was pulled from its websiteon Sunday. The department published the list on May 29, citing its decision under President Donald Trump\u2019sProtecting American Communities from Criminal Aliens executive order. The page claimed that \u201csanctuary jurisdictions undermine the rule of law and endanger the lives of Americans and law enforcement.\u201d Of the 53 sanctuary jurisdictions identified for Colorado when the list was taken down, Western Slope counties included Eagle, Garfield, Pitkin, Rio Grande, Summit and Lake counties. Towns included Avon, Basalt, Carbondale, Dillion, Eagle and Vail. Routt County was not included on the list. Several Colorado countieshave declared themselves as \u201cnon-sanctuary,\u201d including Garfield County.Despite commissioners signing a resolution in 2024declaring that it would not aid or provide shelter to undocumented migrants, the county was still included in the list. \u201cAs far as that whole list, it\u2019s just kind of BS,\u201d Garfield County Commissioner Tom Jankovsky said. \u201cWe have our resolution. The sheriff follows state laws. That\u2019s kind of where we are.\u201d Jankovsky said Garfield County commissioners passing a resolution stating it\u2019s not a sanctuary county was \u201cprimarily in response to the Venezuelans who were camping out in Carbondale.\u201d \u201cWe were stating that we were not going to provide assistance to undocumented immigrants as far as food and shelter,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they got here, then they need to be able to take care of themselves.\u201d Of the other Western Slope counties included in the department\u2019s list, none have officially passed resolutions declaring themselves as sanctuary jurisdictions. Eagle County,while having passed a resolutionrelating to support for local immigrants,does not adopt the label. Several may have still been identified due to having policies that align with sanctuary principles. According to the Department of Homeland Security, criteria for a county or city to be designated as a sanctuary jurisdiction is based on multiple factors: \u201cself-identification as a sanctuary jurisdiction, noncompliance with Federal law enforcement in enforcing immigration laws, restrictions on information sharing, and legal protections for illegal aliens.\u201d Colorado itself was listed by the department as a sanctuary state based on \u201cself-Identification as a state sanctuary jurisdiction.\u201d Colorado Gov. Jared Polis has maintained that Colorado is not a sanctuary state, emphasizing its cooperation with federal law enforcement on criminal investigations. However, Colorado lawlimits how local law enforcement can cooperatewith U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. In May,Polis also signed legislationprohibiting jails from delaying the release of individuals for immigration enforcement purposes and restricting local governments from sharing personal information with federal immigration agencies. These immigration policies have come under attack by the Trump administration, whichfiled a lawsuit against the state of Coloradoand the city of Denver in May seeking to remove local policies restricting cooperation between local law enforcement and federal immigration authorities. Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser, along with a coalition of 19 attorneys general, responded byfiling two lawsuits against the Trump administrationclaiming its use of billions in emergency services and infrastructure projects to impose \u201cillegal immigration conditions\u201d is unlawful. The department said it notified each listed jurisdiction of its \u201cnon-compliance with Federal statutes\u201d and demands that these jurisdictions \u201cimmediately review and revise their policies to align with Federal immigration laws and renew their obligation to protect American citizens, not dangerous illegal aliens.\u201d The message has since been taken down along with the list. The National Sheriffs\u2019 Association President Sheriff Kieran Donahue had publiclycriticized the listprior to Sunday for being created \u201cwithout any input, criteria of compliance, or a mechanism for how to object to the designation.\u201d \u201cSheriffs nationwide have no way to know what they must do or not do to avoid this arbitrary label,\u201d Donahue said in a statement.
