DFRW's four clubs touched down in force wearing their trademark red and showing suport for Republican members of the state House of Representatives and Senate. It was also the day for statewide school board elections, with several ladies proudly wearing their \"I Voted\" stickers. Others planned to vote after after Legislative Day concluded. House Minority Leader Timothy Dukes (R-Laurel) and other legislators welcomed our ladies to Legislative Hall and gathered with them for a photograph on the Capitol steps. A tour of the building followed, and a terrific lunch was hosted by the staff and legislators of the House Minority caucus, with appearances (and stories) made by a few of our state senators. DFRW is active volunteering with every type of election in Delaware, from county row offices to federal campaigns. The annual trek to Legislative Hall is a way for legislators to say thank you to our hard working DFRW club members and is a wonderful opportunity for members to catch up with each other. **** **Categories** RSSExpand/CollapseNews(92)RSSExpand/CollapseNews Releases(80)RSSExpand/CollapseMedia Advisories(2) RSSExpand/CollapseNews Releases(80) RSSExpand/CollapseMedia Advisories(2) RSSExpand/CollapseNews Releases(80) RSSExpand/CollapseMedia Advisories(2) RSSExpand/CollapseArticles(178)RSSExpand/CollapseCommittees(153)RSSExpand/CollapseLocal Clubs(35)RSSExpand/CollapseState Federations(190)RSSExpand/CollapseIssues(13) RSSExpand/CollapseCommittees(153) RSSExpand/CollapseLocal Clubs(35) RSSExpand/CollapseState Federations(190) RSSExpand/CollapseIssues(13) RSSExpand/CollapseCommittees(153) RSSExpand/CollapseLocal Clubs(35) RSSExpand/CollapseState Federations(190) RSSExpand/CollapseIssues(13) RSSExpand/CollapseProfiles(84)RSSExpand/CollapseClub Spotlights(661)RSSExpand/CollapseCandidates(84) RSSExpand/CollapseClub Spotlights(661) RSSExpand/CollapseCandidates(84) RSSExpand/CollapseClub Spotlights(661) RSSExpand/CollapseCandidates(84) **Archive** 2025, June(10) 2025, May(60) 2025, April(22) 2025, March(20) 2025, February(22) 2025, January(18) 2024, December(19) 2024, November(15) 2024, October(35) 2024, September(17) 2024, August(13) 2024, July(22) 2024, June(14) 2024, May(32) 2024, April(17) 2024, March(14) 2024, February(15) 2024, January(10) 2023, December(23) 2023, November(13) 2023, October(18) 2023, September(16) 2023, August(18) 2023, July(18) 2023, June(25) 2023, May(56) 2023, April(12) 2023, March(26) 2023, February(21) 2023, January(19) 2022, December(19) 2022, November(18) 2022, October(17) 2022, September(16) 2022, August(19) 2022, July(15) 2022, June(20) 2022, May(17) 2022, April(13) 2022, March(18) 2022, February(7) 2022, January(6) 2021, December(11) 2021, November(7) 2021, October(8) 2021, September(15) 2021, August(10) 2021, July(14) 2021, June(14) 2021, May(41) 2021, April(21) 2021, March(16) 2021, February(9) 2021, January(9) 2020, December(6) 2020, November(4) 2020, October(12) 2020, September(14) 2020, August(15) 2020, July(11) 2020, June(14) 2020, May(12) 2020, April(13) 2020, March(15) 2020, February(6) 2020, January(3) 2019, December(4) 2019, November(5) 2019, October(3) 2019, September(11) 2019, August(7) 2019, July(6) 2019, June(14) 2019, May(32) 2019, April(15) 2019, March(16) 2019, February(5) 2019, January(2) 2018, December(3) 2018, November(4) 2018, October(11) 2018, September(4) 2018, August(3) 2018, July(8) 2018, June(5) 2018, May(3) 2018, April(6) 2018, February(4) 2018, January(7) 2017, December(1) 2017, October(1) 2017, September(5) 2017, August(4) 2017, July(3) 2017, June(8) 2017, May(9) 2017, April(3) 2017, March(1) 2017, February(2) 2017, January(3) 2016, December(2) 2016, November(6) 124 N.
