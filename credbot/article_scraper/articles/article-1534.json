The race, titled \u201cEnd2End,\u201d will take place on Tuesday, June 17th, and is a 1,000-kilometre relay involving eight cyclists, who will be pedaling from Victoria to Port Hardy and back. This relay is done in support of the Island Kids Cancer Association (IKCA), which is a small, but mighty, charity that works with families on Vancouver Island and the Gulf Islands who have been impacted by childhood cancer. IKCA was founded by Susan Kerr in 2017, who lost her own son, Jacob, to the disease. Her understanding and knowledge of the struggles these families face offers her intimate insight into their struggles, as well as the ability to provide adequate care. End2End, created by Andy Dunstan, was launched as a fundraising relay in hopes of providing IKCA with the support needed to continue their work. He envisioned four pairs of cyclists taking turns riding a succession of 50-kilometre segments. Each pair will be pedalling for around two hours, rest of six, then go for another leg in this round-the-clock journey. Upon completion of the relay, each rider will have cycled 250 kilometres. The funds raised from the relay will go towards IKCA\u2019s mission to provide these families with essentials such as fuel, food, and mental health care, as many have to leave their jobs to care for their children. \u201cThose three should never be out of reach for families supporting a child with cancer,\u201d said Kerr in a media release. Not only will End2End support day-to-day essentials for these families, it will also give the community the chance to learn more about IKCA and ways they can get involved beyond race day. Dunstan will be racing, alongside Bill Fry, the owner of Trek Bicycle Store Victoria, who is also sponsoring the event. Dunstan and Fry will set out from Trek Bicycle Store in Vic West at 6 p.m., making their way to Cobble Hill before giving way to Saanich police officer Rob McDonald and Duncan resident Chris Day, a CFB Esquimalt firefighter. The next pair includes CHEK News\u2019 Mary Griffin and retired Mountie Steve Foster, followed by commercial realtor Erin Glazier and VicPD detective Kevin Nystedt. The race is estimated to to end on Thursday, June 19th around suppertime, two days after they first began their journey. Already the event has created a lot of buzz, and has drawn a great deal of community support leading up to the relay. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen a group of people come together and ignite the community in the way they have,\u201d said Kerr.
