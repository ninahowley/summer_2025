After all, parenting is a nuanced, decades-long task involving many complex variables. There is no magic formula or \u2018how-to\u2019 guide for doing it correctly. But there are interesting insights into the common characteristics of high-achieving children, giving parents ideas on how to create their own \u2018super families\u2019, as they\u2019re sometimes called. One source giving voice to these insights isMichael Amin, the founder and CEO ofMaximum Difference Foundation(MDF) and the Founder and CEO of Primex World Inc. MDF is an organization dedicated to, among many other causes, advocating for parents to learn the art and science of parenting by reading books, watching videos, going to seminars and, if needed, talking to a therapist. \u201cParenting is about creating an environment where children can learn, grow, and develop the skills they need to navigate their way through the world confidently, as well as be happy and resilient. These are all traits needed to be successful,\u201d he says. \u201cThe key is figuring out ways to facilitate such an environment.\u201d AtMDF, Michael Amin and his team measure their work by what he calls \u201cunits of positive change.\u201d The idea is to create as much positive change as possible in the world while using as few resources as possible to do so. For example, just like businesses use the concept of return on investment (ROI), for non-profits, it\u2019s about the return on investment for time and money to yield the maximum units of positive change. This idealistic/pragmatic worldview is inspired by Amin\u2019s ownsuccess in the private sector, and his overarching goal is manifested in the foundation\u2019s name \u2013 to make the maximum difference through focused, results-driven strategies. Amin determined early on that encouraging parents to take the time to learn the best practices for raising kids would be one of the most effective ways to achieve this goal. \u201cOver the years, through my role with Maximum Difference Foundation, I believe I\u2019ve found some commonalities in households who raise happy and successful children through experience and research,\u201d he explains. One trait that has been found in many \u2018super families\u2019 is the influence of parents who have had some sort of teaching experience. These parents often understand the importance of early learning, how to teach, and the lasting impact it can have on a child\u2019s development better than most. As a result, many of them work hard to create a home environment where learning is fun and natural. \u201cOne of the primary roles of a parent is to help children feel supported during the critical early stage of their learning journey,\u201d says Amin. \u201cBy encouraging curiosity and exploration, parent-teachers are professionally trained and ideally suited to set the foundation for lifelong learning.\u201d These parents often take an active role in teaching their children outside of school, whether it\u2019s through extra reading, doing educational activities together, or engaging in conversations that serve to expand their knowledge. Such early, consistent involvement can help children become confident, independent thinkers who are more prepared to succeed in life. In many high-achievingfamilies, political awareness and activism also play significant roles in shaping children\u2019s lives. Parents who are involved in social causes often encourage their children to become active participants in making a difference in the world \u2013 a cause near and dear to Michael Amin\u2019s heart. \u201cWhen children grow up in an environment where standing up for what\u2019s right is highly valued, they learn that they too can contribute to creating positive change,\u201d he says. These kinds of families tend to teach their children that they have the power to influence the world around them, whether it\u2019s through activism or other forms of social engagement. As such, political awareness often becomes a core part of their upbringing, instilling within them a sense of responsibility and a drive to fight for fairness and justice. \u201cQuite often, this can translate into personal traits such as resilience and a \u2018can-do\u2019 attitude into the teenage years, young adulthood, and well beyond,\u201d asserts Amin. \u201cIt\u2019s important to note that while high-achieving parents often have the best intentions, sometimes their relentless pursuit of excellence can inadvertently place overwhelming pressure on their children. This excessive push can transform the concept of success into a source of constant distress rather than a joyful journey of growth and achievement.\u201d Finding the right balance between raising happy children and preparing them for success is one of the biggest challenges parents face. Michael Amin believes that while happiness should come first, success naturally follows when children grow up in an environment that encourages resilience, progress, and accomplishment. Prioritizing children\u2019s happiness over success doesn\u2019t mean giving them everything they want or making life easy. In fact, true happiness comes from overcoming challenges, learning new skills, and feeling a sense of purpose. Studies support this idea. Research published in theInternational Journal of Environmental Research and Public Healthfound that children who experience warmth and support from their parents tend to be happier, while constant conflict can harm their well-being. Another study from Penn State Health emphasizes that kids who are taught to embrace challenges and learn from failure develop stronger emotional resilience and long-term satisfaction. Amin stresses that the goal isn\u2019t to shield children from difficulties but to help them develop the mindset and skills needed to navigate life\u2019s obstacles. By encouraging effort, curiosity, problem-solving, and perseverance, parents can create an environment where happiness and success go hand in hand, allowing children to thrive both emotionally and in their future achievements. Amin says, \u201cHappier children grow into more self-assured adults who are better equipped to function in society and make positive contributions. Developing happy children who transition into happy adults is more important than developing successful adults.\u201dThis philosophy is central to MDF\u2019s work, which aims to optimize its impact by applying a results-driven, return-on-investment approach to philanthropy. \u201cFor every dollar we invest, we try to calculate how many units of positive change we\u2019re creating,\u201d explains Amin. \u201cSay we start with a $5 million budget, for example. Using that, MDF can reach something like 50 million people. And even if only 10% of those people are inspired to take action on improving their parenting, that\u2019s still a giant return on investment in terms of units of positive change.\u201d While MDF does not provide direct education or parenting classes,Michael Aminstresses the importance of inspiring parents to take the initiative in learning about how to be better parents themselves and then practicing what they have learned. His goal is to help parents understand that they have the ability to shape the future of their children\u2014and, by extension, the world\u2014by creating environments where kids can thrive. Parenting is just one of many important causes that the Maximum Difference Foundation supports. The foundation works hand-in-hand with several other well-known charities, including Doctors Without Borders, Amnesty International, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, and Human Rights Watch, all in the name of creating positive change. But parenting is arguably one of its top priorities. \u201cIf anyone out there wants to learn more about the subject and is looking for a good place to start, I very much recommend aTime Magazine articlefrom 2016, which outlines the six factors common to Super Families,\u201d says Amin. \u201cThe adults of tomorrow will determine how we deal with the many looming challenges we\u2019re facing, some of which are existential. This is really important stuff for the future of the human race, and it\u2019s why I feel parenting is one of the things that can make a maximum difference.\u201d A professional writer with over a decade of incessant writing skills.
