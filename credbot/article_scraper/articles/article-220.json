Kim/Chicago TribuneSofia Salinas walks along the fenced-in area that was to become a migrant tent encampment near her home in the Brighton Park neighborhood, Dec. 14, 2023, in Chicago. Salinas and her neighbors are concerned about the presence of ground chemicals on the site that prevented the encampment from opening. She said all of the construction that had been completed was taken down fully by the previous night. Despite assurances from Gov. JB Pritzker that state taxpayers would not end up footing the bill for a migrant tent encampment in Chicago that was never built, the state recently agreed to pay $1.3 million to the project\u2019s contractor. Pritzker made thehighly publicized decisionto halt construction of the shelter encampment in Chicago\u2019s Brighton Park neighborhood in December 2023, saying \u201cserious environmental concerns\u201d were still present at the city-selected site. The governor\u2019s decision caused theBrighton Park projectto be scrapped, and it signaled an early political rift between the governor and Mayor Brandon Johnson, who was pushing for the shelter to be built as winter arrived and the migrant crisis in the city continued. Pritzker that month also made public assurances that the project\u2019s state contractor, GardaWorld Federal Services, would absorb the costs of the work that it had already put into constructing the camp. \u201cThe understanding with GardaWorld is that they will do other work with us,\u201d Pritzkertold reportersat an unrelated event in December 2023. \u201cAnd they knew, as they were building this shelter, before the environmental report came in, that it was possible that the environmental report wouldn\u2019t allow the building \u2014 the completion, rather \u2014 of the shelter. And so they understood that, and they were willing to take that liability on through the state\u2019s contract.\u201d Officials with Pritzker\u2019s office also said the company had agreed not to charge the state if the land was deemed unsafe. But a $1.3 million payment to GardaWorld was tucked into the recently approved $55 billion state spending plan being sent to Pritzker\u2019s desk. And Pritzker\u2019s Illinois Department of Human Services, which spearheaded the state\u2019s portion of the migrant response, agreed this April to settle a dispute with GardaWorld over payment for its work at the site, other state records show. In response to questions about the apparent contradiction, a Pritzker spokesman maintained that \u201cGardaWorld had no contractual right to payment.\u201d Nevertheless, the state agreed to pay the company because \u201cthe situation evolved,\u201d Pritzker spokesman Alex Gough said. Neither Pritzker\u2019s office nor officials with the state Human Services Department would explain why the state agreed to pay if it was under no legal obligation to do so. GardaWorld did not respond to requests for comment. The so-calledbase camp at the former industrial siteat 38th Street and California Avenue was initially pitched in the fall of 2023 as a way to safely house migrants who arrived from the southern border in such large numbers that the city\u2019s shelter system was overwhelmed. At the time, more than 24,000 migrants had come to Chicago, mostly hailing from Central and South America, with the influx being so great during fall 2023 that a peak of about 3,800 arrivals were camped at police stations and O\u2019Hare International Airport. Johnson initially unveiled the general tent camp idea in September 2023. While Pritzker publicly said at the time he preferred to use existing buildings if possible,the Tribune later revealedPritzker\u2019s administration had first pitched the idea of \u201coutdoor (soft sided)\u201d lodging options even before Johnson took office. Once Johnson did formally present the idea, he suggested the city could place asylum-seekers in heated winter tents, and theBrighton Park base campcould house approximately 2,000 migrants at a time as they waited for brick-and-mortar shelters to become available. While Pritzker pledged $65 million in state funding for tent encampment work, the Brighton Park site could not be opened until it cleared an environmental study. Despite that, just after Thanksgiving of 2023 and before the environmental report was concluded, GardaWorld began construction on the site, with the governor later saying the company had agreed not to charge the state if the land was deemed unsafe. That happened weeks later with the release of the city\u2019s environmental review late on a Friday evening. Pritzker\u2019s staff saw its contents at roughly the same time as those who\u2019d filed open records requests for the nearly 800-page document and the governor\u2019s office said the site was not safe to house people. The incident set off days of finger-pointing between the governor\u2019s office and City Hall and stirred controversy and inflamed tensions between Pritzker and Johnson early in the new mayor\u2019s tenure. Now, according to records from the Illinois Court of Claims, which handles monetary claims against the state, the Human Services Department and the contractor were \u201cin agreement\u201d that GardaWorld was owed $1.3 million \u201cfor services rendered at the 38th and California site\u201d during the state budget year that ended June 30, 2024. They also agreed that the money would be \u201cconsidered full payment and satisfaction of all claims by GardaWorld against the Illinois Department of Human Services\u201d for the site work. The state payment, to be made in the state budget year that begins July 1 if Pritzker signs the spending plan as expected, would essentially close the books on the unrealized migrant tent encampment plan. But it isn\u2019t the only cost borne by taxpayers for the unused site. Aside from the money the state is set to pay out, the city spent about $1.7 million on environmental remediation and a settlement with the property\u2019s owner. The mayor\u2019s office has said the remediation will provide \u201ca lasting community benefit.\u201d Republicans nationally have long blamed the migrant crisis on what they characterized as former President Joe Biden\u2019s failure to enforce immigration laws. The Illinois GOP also blamed Pritzker and other Democrats in Springfield for enacting policies that welcome immigrants and provide government services regardless of legal status. The Democrats in Washington, D.C., Springfield and elsewhere, meanwhile, faulted congressional Republicans for blocking comprehensive efforts to overhaul the immigration system and GOP governors for sending migrants to other states with little care for what would happen to them after they arrived at more northern locales. \u201cIt\u2019s clear taxpayers are still on the hook for the migrant crisis of the Democrat majority\u2019s making,\u201d Illinois House Republican Leader Tony McCombie of Savanna said in a recent statement. \u201cThis is just one of the many repercussions taxpayers will face for continued agency mismanagement under the Pritzker administration.\u201d About a month after the brouhaha between Pritzker and Johnson over the Brighton Park site, the state opened a long-discussed but much smaller shelter in a former CVS store in the Little Village neighborhood. The shelter, large enough to accommodate about 300 migrants, was operated by GardaWorld and nonprofit New Life Centers and closed after about 10 months in late October 2024. GardaWorld also worked with the state to open two other shelters last summer: One in a recently renovated Holiday Inn in the West Lawn neighborhood that could house up to 1,700 people and another 750-bed facility for families in a former Hyde Park hotel. Migrant and homeless shelters have since been merged through the \u201cOne System Initiative.\u201d GardaWorld completed its work with the state Human Services Department in January, an agency spokeswoman said. Over the past two years, the state has paid the Virginia-based company nearly $46.7 million, according to the state comptroller\u2019s office.
