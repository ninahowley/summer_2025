Well that is exactly what Cecile Richards, the President of Planned Parenthood, seems to think. This disgusting waste of human flesh should be banned from any and all interaction with children with her clone-like beliefs of Margret Sanger. Who says something like this and maintains any kind of public following? Oh, that\u2019s right\u2026 a liberal murderer. Via Truth Feed : Things went very poorly for Cecile Richards when she tried to mix two things that don\u2019t go well together at all \u2013 Mother\u2019s day wishes and abortions. In her tweet, she writes \u201cNothing says \u2018I love you, Mom!\u2019 like standing up for the right of mothers everywhere to get the care they need.\u201d One reply to her has nearly as many \u201clikes\u201d as her original tweet. It says \u201cNothing says \u2018I love you, mom!\u2019 Like the deafening silence of a dead baby who will never say \u2018I love you, Mom!\u201d Amiright? Other responses are equally snarky, pointing out the blatant hypocrisy. Finally, Dinesh D\u2019Souza weighs in as well. This open \u2018tolerance\u2019 policy of the left has gone far beyond any sense orlf normal morality and values in this country, and it leaves many of us wanting to wipe the slate clean. Never in the history of America has society been quite this full of ridiculous and absolutely unbelievably moronic social leaders. Can we vote to jail them all for the betterment of our future? Please? How do you feel about this attack of motherhood?
