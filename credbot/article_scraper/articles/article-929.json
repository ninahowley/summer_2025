Santana\u2019s third-inning slam came on the 15th anniversary of his major league debut. It was his eighth homer this season and made it 5-0, helping Cleveland salvage the finale of this three-game series. Francona\u2019s Reds swept the Guardians in three games at Cincinnati last month. The Guardians had five straight hits to open a four-run sixth for a nine-run lead, including a three-run homer by Lane Thomas. Cleveland\u2019s 11 runs were a season high. Thomas\u2019 homer was his first this season after returning from the injured list this week. He had three hits, drove in three runs and scored twice. Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00edrez hit an RBI double to extend his career-long on-base streak to 37 games, the longest active streak in the majors. He has a hit in 11 straight games. Logan Allen (4-4) went six innings and gave up solo homers to Elly De La Cruz and TJ Friedl. He struck out six. Nick Lodolo (4-5) lasted only 3 1/3 innings, giving up six runs. Cincinnati\u2019s Christian Encarnacion-Strand was hit on the bill of his helmet by a 97 mph pitch from Emmanuel Clase in the ninth but stayed in the game. Angel Mart\u00ednez and Thomas singled and Ram\u00edrez was hit by a pitch to set up Santana\u2019s slam. Ram\u00edrez hit his 380th career double, passing Earl Averill for third-most in franchise history. He trails Hall of Famers Tris Speaker (486) and Nap Lajoie (424). Cincinnati\u2019s Nick Martinez (4-6, 3.70 ERA) will pitch against Keider Montero (2-1, 4.30) at Detroit on Friday. Cleveland\u2019s Gavin Williams (5-3, 3.86) will face Luis Castillo (4-4, 3.31) at Seattle on June 13. **Share this:** Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Facebook Click to share on X (Opens in new window)X **RevContent Feed** **Most Popular** Trent\u2019s Joint on the River opens in LorainTrent's Joint on the River opens in Lorain **Trent\u2019s Joint on the River opens in Lorain** **Trent\u2019s Joint on the River opens in Lorain** Man facing drug charges after Elyria traffic stopMan facing drug charges after Elyria traffic stop **Man facing drug charges after Elyria traffic stop** **Man facing drug charges after Elyria traffic stop** On the job with Andy Docerty, owner of Doc\u2019s Open Box in VermilionOn the job with Andy Docerty, owner of Doc's Open Box in Vermilion **On the job with Andy Docerty, owner of Doc\u2019s Open Box in Vermilion** **On the job with Andy Docerty, owner of Doc\u2019s Open Box in Vermilion** Richard Ramsey resigns as Amherst treasurer, successor to be appointedRichard Ramsey resigns as Amherst treasurer, successor to be appointed **Richard Ramsey resigns as Amherst treasurer, successor to be appointed** **Richard Ramsey resigns as Amherst treasurer, successor to be appointed** Mihaljevic\u2019s mother diesMihaljevic's mother dies **Mihaljevic\u2019s mother dies** **Mihaljevic\u2019s mother dies** Burns Road in Elyria to receive safety improvements following boy\u2019s deathBurns Road in Elyria to receive safety improvements following boy's death **Burns Road in Elyria to receive safety improvements following boy\u2019s death** **Burns Road in Elyria to receive safety improvements following boy\u2019s death** High school girls softball: Area players earn 2025 All-Ohio honorsHigh school girls softball: Area players earn 2025 All-Ohio honors **High school girls softball: Area players earn 2025 All-Ohio honors** **High school girls softball: Area players earn 2025 All-Ohio honors** Breakthrough Kitchen serves up homemade Lorain favoritesBreakthrough Kitchen serves up homemade Lorain favorites **Breakthrough Kitchen serves up homemade Lorain favorites** **Breakthrough Kitchen serves up homemade Lorain favorites** Amherst trio, Keystone\u2019s Webb receive All-Ohio first-team baseball honorsAmherst trio, Keystone's Webb receive All-Ohio first-team baseball honors **Amherst trio, Keystone\u2019s Webb receive All-Ohio first-team baseball honors** **Amherst trio, Keystone\u2019s Webb receive All-Ohio first-team baseball honors** All-Ohioan ace Karina Shuster sets tone for Amherst softball\u2019s next chapterAll-Ohioan ace Karina Shuster sets tone for Amherst softball's next chapter **All-Ohioan ace Karina Shuster sets tone for Amherst softball\u2019s next chapter** **All-Ohioan ace Karina Shuster sets tone for Amherst softball\u2019s next chapter** **More in Sports** Amherst baseball: Postseason adversity serves Comets well heading into big weekend **Amherst baseball: Postseason adversity serves Comets well heading into big weekend** **Amherst baseball: Postseason adversity serves Comets well heading into big weekend** Female athletes appeal landmark NCAA settlement, saying it violates federal antidiscrimination law **Female athletes appeal landmark NCAA settlement, saying it violates federal antidiscrimination law** **Female athletes appeal landmark NCAA settlement, saying it violates federal antidiscrimination law** Crushers drop 7-2 decision to visiting Otters **Crushers drop 7-2 decision to visiting Otters** **Crushers drop 7-2 decision to visiting Otters** PHOTOS: Crushers-Otters, June 10, 2025 **PHOTOS: Crushers-Otters, June 10, 2025** **PHOTOS: Crushers-Otters, June 10, 2025** 2025 June 11 Subscriber ServicesSubscribeSign Up For Newsletterse-EditionSitemap Subscribe Sign Up For Newsletters e-Edition Sitemap Subscribe Sign Up For Newsletters e-Edition Sitemap Contact UsWork With UsSubmit AnnouncementsiOS AppAndroid AppNews-HeraldPrivacy PolicyAccessibility Work With Us Submit Announcements iOS App Android App News-Herald Privacy Policy Accessibility Work With Us Submit Announcements iOS App Android App News-Herald Privacy Policy Accessibility JobsClassifiedsNetwork AdvertisingPlace Classified AdAdvertising Inquiry Classifieds Network Advertising Place Classified Ad Advertising Inquiry Classifieds Network Advertising Place Classified Ad Advertising Inquiry Subscribe Now Terms of Use Cookie Policy Cookie Preferences California Notice at Collection Notice of Financial Incentive Do Not Sell/Share My Personal Information Arbitration MediaNews Group Powered by WordPress.com VIP Copyright \u00a9 2025 MediaNews Group"}
