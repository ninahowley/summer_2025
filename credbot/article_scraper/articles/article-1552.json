Manuel Martinez/WBEZ **Why is Chicago violence plummeting? Some credit street outreach workers.** **A reporter rides along to get an up-close look at the violence intervention work that aims to prevent retaliation in the aftermath of shootings.** SHARE COPY LINK Share Email Facebook Twitter Print Mid-morning is usually a quiet time in Frederick Seaton\u2019s profession. I\u2019m across the table at the Institute for Nonviolence Chicago\u2019s main office on the West Side, ready to record an interview. But his phone keeps lighting up. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Seaton answers a call from one of the nine street outreach workers he supervises in West Garfield Park, the neighborhood where they all grew up. Seaton hears there was a shooting minutes ago near West Madison Street, the neighborhood\u2019s main drag. The outreach worker on the phone, who\u2019s already there, tells Seaton there are two victims, a man and a woman. Seaton\u2019s team is looking into what sparked the attack and gathering information about the victims\u2019 relatives. Their goal is to track down anyone prone to retribution, he says. \u201cEverybody has got a crazy cousin,\u201d Seaton says. \u201cEverybody has got a family member that\u2019s hotheaded.\u201d A half hour later, Seaton receives a notification about the shooting from the police. One of the victims has died: the man, 33, who sustained gunshot wounds to the chest. Seaton offers to continue our interview. But he also wants to stop by where the shooting took place and then strategize with his staff on their response. He invites me to ride along and get a closer look at street outreach, a publicly funded approach known as community violence intervention, or CVI. \u201cWe\u2019ve been working at this for years,\u201d Seaton, 66, says, talking about his team\u2019s credibility with people living in West Garfield Park and about the neighborhood\u2019s plummeting shooting numbers. \u201cWe\u2019ve been chipping at it and chipping at it,\u201d he says. \u201cNow, we\u2019re seeing some of the results.\u201d **The racial safety gap in Chicago** Chicago\u2019s violence surged in 2016, as police community relations tanked in the months following the court-ordered release of video showing teenager Laquan McDonald\u2019s killing on the Southwest Side by a cop who repeatedly shot him. The numbers of shootings and killings soared again in 2020 \u2014 the year of COVID-19\u2019s arrival and George Floyd\u2019s killing by a Minneapolis police officer. Since 2021, the violence numbers have been dropping. By Wednesday, Chicago had recorded 157 murders this year \u2014 the fewest of any year to that date since 2014. At the same time, the \u201csafety gap\u201d \u2014 the difference in murder counts by race \u2014 has narrowed. Since 2021, the numbers of white victims hardly has budged. That\u2019s while the number of Black victims has plunged. Through Tuesday, there have been 50% fewer this year than during the same period of 2021. Still, the safety gap remains staggering. This year, Black Chicagoans have been 19 times more likely than white Chicagoans to be the victim of a homicide. The community areas where violence numbers have fallen fastest includeWest Garfield Park. Through Tuesday, the area has had three homicides and 24 nonfatal shootings this year. Those numbers are significantly down from the same span of 2021, when there were 15 homicides and 56 nonfatal shootings. There is no shortage of agencies and people \u2014 from police to youth mentors \u2014 who have been credited with having a hand in Chicago\u2019s public safety improvement, which also mirrors national trends. Some experts point to CVI, a field Seaton entered 18 years ago. Like many doing similar work in Chicago, Seaton spent years in prison and then, after his release, learned violence intervention skills at Ceasefire, a nonprofit now known as Cure Violence, where he started in 2005. Since 2016, Seaton has worked for the Institute for Nonviolence Chicago, an agency focused on several West Side and South Side neighborhoods. **Building trust \u2014 with cops and communities** Seaton takes me to his car, a 9-year-old gray sedan, and we hustle to the shooting scene. \u201cI have a team on location, and I have a team at the hospital,\u201d he says. Seaton says they\u2019re all trying to find out whether the shooting stemmed from domestic violence, some other sort of interpersonal conflict or a dispute among drug dealers or gangs. Not the big gangs that held sway on the West Side when Seaton was young. Today\u2019s gangs are much smaller. They\u2019re known as cliques. Seaton says West Garfield Park alone has 24 cliques. A half block from the shooting scene, Seaton spots one of his staffers. It\u2019s not hard. They all wear neon-yellow T-shirts. \u201cI\u2019ll see you at the office,\u201d Seaton tells him. Then, Seaton gets a text from the police district commander. \u201cGood morning,\u201d Seaton reads me the message. \u201cReaching out to get you any assistance that we can help.\u201d Many street outreach groups maintain relations with the local police district. They might rely on the police for security at large gatherings such as funerals. And sometimes the cops will flag a particular conflict and ask the institute to intervene. But Seaton says the commander knows that his outreach team won\u2019t help the police solve crimes or make arrests. \u201cThe professional understanding is we don\u2019t share information,\u201d Seaton says. That\u2019s key, he says. Because, if they told the police what they know about any shooting, they could lose the community\u2019s trust. \u201cWe don\u2019t work for them,\u201d Seaton says. \u201cOur job is to do what we do because we can get into some crannies and some holes that [the police] can\u2019t get in, and we can try to stop the shooting before the young men have to deal with law enforcement.\u201d Still, the commander\u2019s text conveys respect for Seaton and the institute. \u201cThis has been a long time coming,\u201d Seaton says, recalling decades of mistrust between Chicago cops and street outreach organizations. **Working to prevent retaliation, to stop more violence** After rolling past the shooting scene, Seaton heads to the hospital, where vital work takes place to prevent retaliation. Two of his staffers are already there. Their job includes listening and validating feelings. \u201cWhen someone is experiencing trauma, they need some comfort,\u201d Seaton says. \u201cWe want to show love to the families.\u201d At the hospital, there\u2019s also crucial information to gather. \u201cThere might be somebody that\u2019s related, that\u2019s a friend that you might have a relationship with, that can help you in determining your course of action,\u201d Seaton says. At the emergency entrance, dozens of friends and relatives of the 33-year-old man who was killed have gathered. \u201cThis is a hostile situation,\u201d Seaton says, \u201cthe level of tension right now, trying to figure it out or point the finger.\u201d He checks in with his staff members. He finds out the man\u2019s loved ones still don\u2019t know he is deceased. When the word finally comes, they start crying. They wail. A man with a beard runs from the crowd to a car and climbs behind the wheel. Two women follow. \u201cThe family\u2019s trying to stop him from going to retaliate against anybody,\u201d Seaton says. The women get the man out of the car. All three embrace. They wail together. But the man can\u2019t hold himself up. He collapses to the pavement.

Manuel Martinez / WBEZ **Relief, but still a need \u2018to stop this incident from escalating\u2019** \u201cThe most important part about any crime scene or any shooting is buying time,\u201d Seaton says. \u201cWe get some love in there, and they get time to think.\u201d He gets a call from a staffer back near the crime scene. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Seaton asks. \u201cAll right, I\u2019ll slide on you in a minute.\u201d He hangs up and mulls what he\u2019s been told. \u201cInterpersonal,\u201d Seaton concludes. He means the shooting motive wasn\u2019t mainly a matter of gang rivalries. \u201cThat\u2019s a big relief,\u201d Seaton says, \u201cbecause, when cliques are involved, it\u2019s a longer mediation.\u201d The perpetrators of a shooting stemming from an interpersonal conflict tend to be known by the victim\u2019s loved ones and are often arrested, he says. That simplifies the response of the outreach workers. \u201cThe strategy now is to try to get the family members not to react,\u201d Seaton says. That starts with the bearded man who tried to drive off from the hospital. \u201cWe get to that young man, then to his closest friends,\u201d Seaton says. \u201cAnd we get to some of those young ladies\u201d who got him out of the car \u201cto stop this incident from escalating.\u201d It\u2019s the approach that Seaton\u2019s team and other outreach workers from the institute have taken countless times. They can\u2019t do much about the easy access to guns throughout the city. In West Garfield Park, though, they have resources to head off retaliation. \u201cWith relationship gathering and being credible messengers, we\u2019re going to be able to work with the community to stop the next shooting,\u201d Seaton says. Seaton heads from the hospital to his office. He and his staff need to get to work on a plan to do that. Chip Mitchellreports for WBEZ Chicago on policing, public safety and public health.
