For decades, researchers pondered how humans will have sex in space, and what the future of sexting will be once humans are living for extended periods of time without gravity. To help investigate this, Congress allocated $5 million in the 2018 budget specifically for research into how humans will have sex in space. \u201cI spent a year on the thing, and you get lonely sometimes,\u201d said astronaut Kelly Scott. \u201cSo I was excited to hear that we\u2019d finally be getting some action!\u201d The results of the study were published today in the journalNature: Astronomy. The astronauts started off simple with their experiment, with the basic \u201cMissionary\u201d sexual position. But it quickly became clear that the \u201cbasic\u201d positions were a bit different while in space. \u201cIt was hard to decide who was on top and who was on bottom\u201d said Kelly. \u201cSince there\u2019s no gravity, there\u2019s no up or down, which means it\u2019s really a matter of interpretation. So we just called it \u2018Schrodinger\u2019s Missionary\u2019 instead.\u201d The same issue came up when the astronauts went with more exotic positions, such as \u201cdoggystyle\u201d and \u201creverse cowgirl.\u201d \u201cIt was hard to decide what was going on. I mean, I got behind her, but we couldn\u2019t decide which position we were trying.\u201d The astronauts completed an exhaustive list of common and uncommon sexual positions, ranging from reverse cowgirl to the Panamanian Petting Zoo, all the way to the Alabama Hot Pocket. NASA insisted toAlternative-Science.comthat this was \u201cimportant research,\u201d adding that it was \u201cgroundbreaking.\u201d Barr Writes Four Page Summary of Book of Genesis Exonerating God for Great Flood The International Space Station flies through space at a blistering pace of 17,000 miles per hour in order to stay in orbit just 200 miles above the Earth.
