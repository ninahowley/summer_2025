Main St. A reception will follow. Admission is free and open to the public. The idea for the concert began with a simple conversation between Patti, director of the Danville Children\u2019s Choir, and Sam Scheibe, a visiting professor at Centre College. Scheibe, who once sang in a children\u2019s choir in New Jersey, introduced Patti to a choral piece calledForever Songs, which was inspired by the poetry of a young girl named Ava Muhr. That spark turned into a full-fledged concert collaboration between the college\u2019s women\u2019s ensemble and the local children\u2019s choir. **Email newsletter signup** \u201cWe just started talking about what kinds of things we could do together,\u201d Patti said. \u201cIt was really special that the pieces we\u2019re performing were written by young people\u2014a fourth grader and a college student\u2014which matches the age groups of our choirs.\u201d The concert will feature two primary works:Snow Angel, with text and music by Sarah Quartel when she was a sophomore in college, andForever Songs, with music by Joel Krott and text by Ava Muhr, written when she was in fourth grade. Beyond the music, the event will also highlight original poetry from local students. Through connections with Jane Dewey, Danville Schools\u2019 fine arts coordinator, winners of the Frank X Walker Poetry Contest will read their poems live during the concert. Additionally, Patti partnered with Kate Snyder of Plaid Elephant Books, who had been working on a \u201cPoet-Tree\u201d project at her bookstore. Selected young poets from that initiative will also be invited to share their work during the event. To deepen the connection between music and language, the choirs held a joint poetry workshop earlier this week. A student Scheibe knew led the session, encouraging participants to explore their emotions through poetry\u2014no rhyming required. \u201cOne of the prompts was simply, \u2018Poetry is\u2026\u2019 and the responses were just beautiful,\u201d Patti said. \u201cOne wrote, \u2018Poetry is the crunching of leaves under my feet in fall,\u2019 and another said, \u2018Poetry is my grandmother\u2019s hug.\u2019 It was really moving.\u201d As a director, Patti said the experience of preparing for the concert has been deeply rewarding. \u201cI usually choose our repertoire myself, but this time I had the opportunity to work with music chosen by someone else\u2014and it was refreshing,\u201d she said. \u201cBut mostly, I just love the kids. They\u2019re so creative and full of surprises, and they all come together around their shared love of music. It\u2019s a beautiful thing.\u201d The concert promises an inspiring evening of music, poetry and community\u2014and a testament to the powerful, expressive voices of young people. **Featured Local Savings** **You Might Like** **City honors women for decades of community impact** **City honors women for decades of community impact** **BOYLE COUNTY FAIR ANNOUNCES 2025 DATES** **BOYLE COUNTY FAIR ANNOUNCES 2025 DATES** **Pioneer Playhouse opens 76th season with Sherlock Holmes mystery** **Pioneer Playhouse opens 76th season with Sherlock Holmes mystery** **Carol\u2019s Bridal and Prom to close after 40 plus years** **Carol\u2019s Bridal and Prom to close after 40 plus years** Upcoming Events **Upcoming Events** **Upcoming Events** Home News Sports Obituaries Opinion Public Records Contests Classifieds Small Business E-Edition Subscriptions Submit a News Tip Submit a Photo Submit a Sports Story Letters to Editor About Us"}
