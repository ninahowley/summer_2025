time bomb\u2019 of ocean acidification has already crossed planetary boundary, threatening marine ecosystems: Study** On the first day of the United Nations Ocean Conference in Nice, France, the findings of a newstudyhave revealed thatocean acidification(OA)\u2013which damagesecosystemslikecoral reefs\u2013is not only getting worse, but crossed its \u201cplanetary boundary\u201d roughly five years ago. The findings came as a surprise, as scientists in areportpublished last year said OA was \u201capproaching a critical threshold,\u201d but had not yet crossed the boundary. The nine defined planetary boundaries in which Earth can operate safely includeclimate change,freshwater useand OA. \u201cOA is the term given to the long-term shift of marine carbonate chemistry resulting primarily from the uptake ofcarbon dioxide(CO2) by theoceans, leading to an increase in ocean acidity and a decrease in carbonate ion (CO32\u2212) concentration,\u201d the authors of the study wrote. OA can severely affect marine organisms through its direct impact on physiology, growth, survival and reproduction. The researchers pointed out that ocean conditions vary widely across the world, with OA levels in tropical regions over two times as high as in polar regions. \u201cLooking across different areas of the world, the polar regions show the biggest changes in ocean acidification at the surface. Meanwhile, in deeper waters, the largest changes are happening in areas just outside the poles and in the upwelling regions along the west coast of North America and near the equator,\u201d said lead author of the reportHelen Findlay, a professor at the United Kingdom\u2019s Plymouth Marine Laboratory (PML) and chair of the North-East Atlantic Ocean Acidification Hub, in a press release from PML. The study, led by PML, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in the United States and Oregon State University\u2019s Cooperative Institute for Marine Resources Studies (CIMERS), said OA\u2019s threat to marine ecosystems globally is much more widespread than previously believed. The research team used the most recent chemical and physical measurements of the upper ocean, along with studies of marine life and advanced computer models to conclude that by 2020, average ocean conditions globally were already very near\u2013and in some regions had already surpassed\u2013the OA \u201cdanger zone.\u201d \u201cMostocean lifedoesn\u2019t just live at the surface\u2014the waters below are home to many more different types ofplantsandanimals. Since these deeper waters are changing so much, the impacts of ocean acidification could be far worse than we thought. This has huge implications for important underwater ecosystems like tropical and even deep-sea coral reefs that provide essential habitats and nursing refuge for many species, in addition to the impacts being felt on bottom-dwelling creatures like crabs, sea stars, and othershellfishsuch as mussels and oysters,\u201d Findlay explained. Professor Helen Findlay working in the laboratory to investigate the impacts of climate change and ocean acidification on marine organisms and ecosystem functioning. Plymouth Marine Laboratory The team discovered that roughly 60 percent of deeper ocean waters\u2013down to approximately 656 feet\u2013had crossed the planetary boundary for OA\u2013compared with 40 percent at the surface. The increase in acidification has enormous implications for the survival rates of many sea creatures, particularly those who build their skeletons or shells from calcium carbonate. Some subtropical and tropical coral reefs have already lost 43 percent of suitable habitats, while pteropods, a main food web species in the polar regions\u2013also known as \u201csea butterflies\u201d\u2013have lost as much as 61 percent of their habitat. Additionally, 13 percent of the habitats of coastal shellfish species have been lost worldwide. Based on the findings, the scientists recommended that a change be made to the previous safety limit of a 10 percent deviation from pre-industrial levels being harmful to ocean ecosystems, as the entire surface of the ocean had already exceeded the stricter limit by about the year 2000. \u201cOcean acidification isn\u2019t just an environmental crisis\u2014it\u2019s a ticking time bomb for marine ecosystems and coastal economies. As our seas increase in acidity, we\u2019re witnessing the loss of critical habitats that countless marine species depend on and this, in turn, has major societal and economic implications.\u201d said Steve Widdicombe, a professor at PML who is co-chair of the Global Ocean Acidification Observing Network, one of the focuses of the UN\u2019s sustainable development goal of addressing and minimizing the effects of OA. \u201cFrom the coral reefs that support tourism to the shellfish industries that sustain coastal communities, we\u2019re gambling with bothbiodiversityand billions in economic value every day that action is delayed,\u201d Widdicombe added. The authors of the study suggested conservation measures should be directed toward to species and regions that are most vulnerable to acidification. They also emphasized the importance of suitable management measures or protection of areas that are the least compromised by acidification to ensure their longevity. The newly identified subsurface water impacts highlight a pressing need to safeguard mid-water habitats and their marine life. The researchers stressed the importance of improved approaches to addressing OA, as well as other ocean pressures, to better support stronger ecosystem resilience. \u201cThis report makes it clear: we are running out of time and what we do\u2014or fail to do\u2014now is already determining our future,\u201d saidJessie Turner, director of the International Alliance to Combat Ocean Acidification, who was not part of the study, as The Guardian reported. We are coming to terms with an existential threat while grappling with the difficult reality that much suitable habitat for key species has already been lost. It\u2019s clear that governments can no longer afford to overlook acidification in mainstream policy agendas. The study, \u201cOcean Acidification: Another Planetary Boundary Crossed,\u201d was published in the journalGlobal Change Biology.
