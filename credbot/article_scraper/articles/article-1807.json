GreenOnyx\u2019s flagship fresh water lentils superfood product, Wanna Greens\u00ae, recently received its CleanScan Certificate of Compliance. In a massive boost for transparency for consumers globally, brands such as GreenOnyx are now able to show, via their CleanScan QR Code, exactly what toxic chemicals they test for, including the laboratory results, and that their testing process meets theCleanScan Certification Standard. Following their success in developing Glyphosate Residue Free certification around the world, The Detox Projecthas launchedCleanScan to revolutionize the way food, supplement, personal care and clothing brands interact with consumers on toxic contaminants and their current third-party certifications. Dr. Tsipi Shoham, Co-Founder and CEO of GreenOnyx, expressed her pride in both their CleanScan and Glyphosate Residue Free certifications, stating, \u201cThese certifications are a testament to our commitment to delivering unparalleled freshness, sterility, and quality on a global scale. This achievement symbolizes trust and assurance for our consumers and expresses our core values of transparency and sustainability.\u201d Henry Rowlands, Founder of The Detox Project, stated, \u201cWe are proud to certify GreenOnyx and Wanna Greens, as they exemplify the highest purity and environmental stewardship standards. GreenOnyx\u2019s commitment to transparency and sustainability aligns perfectly with our mission to promote safer and healthier products for consumers worldwide.The level of interest in CleanScan certification has been massive, with both brands and retailers from around the world including a large retailer in China set to become certified soon.\u201d The initial contaminants included in CleanScan certification are Pesticides and Heavy Metals, with more to follow soon. In addition to this new level of transparency for toxic contaminants The Detox Project is also including third-party certifications inside the CleanScan QR Codes, so that brands can at last easily showcase the multiple certifications they have worked hard to obtain, without taking up too much space on their packaging. Upon certification, brands are issued with a CleanScan QR Code, which can be used on packaging, websites or marketing material. Whenever a consumer scans the QR Code they will be taken to the brand\u2019s CleanScan page, which shows the contaminants the certified product has been tested for, including latest lab results. \u201cToxic chemicals and other unhealthy contaminants have become a major issue for consumers over the last decade. CleanScan is available for brands from the food, supplement, personal care and clothing industries \u2013 we want to add a new level of transparency across the board,\u201d Rowlands concluded.
