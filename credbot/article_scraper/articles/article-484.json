Randy Feenstra for his seat in Iowa\u2019s 4th Congressional District. Melton, of Webster City, has been a vocal critic of incumbent Feenstra\u2019s support for carbon capture pipelines and his taking of tens of thousands of dollars from pipeline advocates, according to a media release from Melton\u2019s campaign. \u201cOur district deserves a representative who listens to its constituents and acts in their best interests. Right now, we have a representative in Randy Feenstra who relies mostly on out-of-state corporate PAC money, which has rendered him unable to represent his constituents because he\u2019s beholden to the billionaires,\u201d Melton said. He vows to continue his rejection of any corporate PAC money in order to speak truth to power without hesitation, and to remain an independent thinker not reliant on oligarchs, D.C. consultants or party talking points in order to put the people first, his media release states. \u201cFrom tackling Iowa\u2019s rising cancer rates and decline in water quality, to opposing the abuse of eminent domain for carbon capture pipelines, to challenging the status quo economically that has left so many of us in the 4th behind, I\u2019m committed to bringing real change to our communities that for far too long have been neglected by our representatives in Congress.\u201d Melton was the Democratic nominee in both 2022 and 2024. In a media release, he said he is launching his 2026 campaign after improving his performance in 33 of the district\u2019s 36 counties while remaining steady in the other three in 2024. The challenger has also been openly critical of Feenstrat in \u201chis avoidance of public pre-announced town halls, the fact he isn\u2019t writing bills that become law, his unwillingness to call President (Donald) Trump out on his trade war actions that close off our farmers\u2019 market access and threaten the closure of our small businesses or the budget he supports that would cut Medicaid and SNAP benefits, and his rejection of federal community improvement earmark money that we sorely need.\u201d He added, \u201cWhile Congressional Republicans in Iowa\u2019s other three districts have brought back millions of dollars to their communities via the federal community improvement program, Feenstra leaves federal tax dollars that come out of our checks on the table while our infrastructure crumbles and our towns shrink from lack of funding.\u201d Melton holds a Bachelor\u2019s degree in history and political science from Iowa State University and a Master\u2019s degree in U.S. History from the University of Kansas. He and his wife, Laura, have two sons, Lincoln and Nigel. **Newsletter** **Local News** **Local News** **Webster County Roads foreman pulls man from burning semi following accident** **Webster County Roads foreman pulls man from burning semi following accident** **Ryan Melton says he will prioritize rural revitalization, anti-corruption efforts, public health** **Ryan Melton says he will prioritize rural revitalization, anti-corruption efforts, public health** **Volunteers are encouraged to help with clean-up day on Saturday** **Volunteers are encouraged to help with clean-up day on Saturday** The City of Webster City is encouraging community members to volunteer to help with the clean-up event on June 14 ... **Iowa egg supplier denies allegations of human trafficking** **Iowa egg supplier denies allegations of human trafficking** An Iowa industrial egg supplier is denying allegations that it engaged in human trafficking or threatened immigrant ... **Passionate gardener** **Passionate gardener** **Wilson Brewer Park Foundation Board will meet Wednesday** **Wilson Brewer Park Foundation Board will meet Wednesday** The Wilson Brewer Park Foundation Board will meet Wednesday, June 11, in the basement of the Wilson Brewer Park ...
