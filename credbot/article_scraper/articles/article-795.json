The ruling stems from an ABC-7 open records request in March that sought all investigative reports related to allegations of misconduct and hazing involving members of the Franklin High School varsity football team. Some information, such as the school's investigative report, was made public. As ABC-7 was first to report, a school investigation revealed there was \u201cinappropriate physical conduct linked to hazing\u201d among teammates on the football team in the Spring of 2024, records show. According to records, some players indicated there was trash talking and took it as a joke, while others pointed to students being dragged to the \u201cHog Pit\u201d, their shirts ripped off, or incidents in the locker room showers where students were slapped and ganged up for initiations.One student told ABC-7he was hazed and sexually harassed. Investigators could not corroborate claims that genitalia was placed on a player\u2019s face or mouth. When ABC-7 requested the investigative report prepared by attorneys Walsh Gallegos Kyle Robinson & Roalson out of Austin, EPISD denied access. The school district\u2019s attorney, S. Anthony Safi, requested a legal opinion to withhold the documents citing attorney-client privilege. \u201cThe investigative report and timeline were intended to be confidential, and have been kept confidential,\u201d Safi wrote in a letter to Paxton on March 21. \u201cThese materials were not intended to be disclosed to third parties other than those to whom disclosure was made in the furtherance of rendition of professional legal services to EPISD, or those reasonably necessary for the transmission of communication.\u201d In a letter dated May 28, Paxton\u2019s Open Records Division agreed with Safi, saying the district \u201cdemonstrated the applicability of the attorney-client privilege to the information at issue.\u201d ABC-7 appealed to Paxton to release the report, along with other materials the district sought to withhold, including an audit of the hazing allegations Safi said was done by the district\u2019s chief internal auditor, a four-page letter sent from Principal Amanda Bowser to now former football coach Daren Walker, and a letter sent from Bowser to the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services. While the Attorney General's ruling allowed the district to withhold most of the information from the public under certain exemptions, it said EPISD had to release the letter of reprimand Walker received from Principal Bowser following its hazing investigation. \u201cUpon review, we find the information at issue related to the employee at issue in his capacity as an athletics coach not a teacher,\u201d the letter from the Attorney General\u2019s Open Records Division states. \u201cThus, we find the district has failed to demonstrate the information at issue consists of documents evaluating the performance of a teacher or administrator for purposes of section 21.355 of the Education Code.\u201d The school launched an investigation in October 2024 after Franklin High School Principal Amanda Bowser received two anonymous letters alleging hazing was happening with the football program, according to records obtained by ABC-7. Records show Daren Walker received a letter of reprimand in November 2024 once school administrators concluded their investigation; however, they decided to re-interview players again about the hazing allegations in mid-February of this year. School officials would only confirm Walker was reassigned on February 26 for a \u201cpersonnel matter,\u201d but records obtained by ABC-7 show he was removed that day from his coaching duties whilebeing investigated for slapping a playeron the back of the head at a fundraising meeting. The outcome of the slapping investigation prompted Franklin High School Principal Amanda Bowser to recommend the termination of Walker\u2019s contract, records show. The records obtained by ABC-7 under the Texas Public Information Act reveal Walker was suspended with pay and is set to retire on Friday, June 6. In Bowser\u2019s 2-page letter of reprimand to Walker dated November 19, 2024, she went over a timeline of the investigation, what prompted it, district policies she said Walker violated, reporting procedures, corrective actions the district can take, and schedule changes \u201cto ensure oversight within the football locker room.\u201d In the letter, Bowser said although they believed Walker didn\u2019t know the extent of hazing, saying, \u201cthe investigation did reveal that there is a culture in football that makes it difficult for your students to report these things directly to your staff.\u201d Bowser stated the football schedule would be changed due to a lack of locker room supervision. \u201cDuring our conversations you have mentioned that coaches need to leave early to get to their next classes, which contributes to this lack of supervision,\u201d Bowser wrote. In Walker\u2019s two-page response nearly three weeks later, he reflected on his tenure at El Paso ISD, writing he had worked for the district for 34 years, while serving as head football coach for 24 years. \u201cTo be clear, I did not, and would not, knowingly allow students to engage in such conduct,\u201d Walker wrote. \u201cI will ensure, moving forward, that the students are comfortable coming forward to report concerns with me and the football staff. I do not agree that I have violated district policy and that a letter of reprimand was warranted in this matter.\u201d Walker said he addressed the team about \u201chorseplay\u201d in the locker room in April 2024, and it stopped immediately. \u201cI never condoned or encouraged any type of hazing, bullying, initiation, or harassment of a student,\u201d Walker wrote. \u201cThe incidents that were reported I could not even imagine.\u201d Walker said a leadership council was created, consisting of Varsity players from each grade level. He said the council was created to, \u201cestablish communication between the locker room and the coaches.\u201d ABC-7 has reached out repeatedly to El Paso ISD and Daren Walker for comment on this investigation. To date, the district has refused to comment, citing ABC-7's Public Information (PIA) request, saying, \u201c...El Paso ISD has sought an Attorney General ruling related to your PIA request. While the Attorney General\u2019s ruling is pending the District will not comment on the matter. El Paso ISD remains committed to creating nurturing environments that support the growth of every child. We take every appropriate action to ensure student and staff safety. We appreciate our community's trust and support.\" ABC-7 has renewed its request for an interview with El Paso ISD this week since the Attorney General has made a ruling in the request. So far, we have not heard back. Meanwhile, a Texas Education Agency spokesperson told ABC-7 that the complaint it received about Walker has been reviewed. \u201cTEA can confirm that the educator in question is under investigation by the agency's Educator Investigations Division,\u201d the Texas Agency of Education said in a written statement. \u201cAn investigatory flag has been placed on their certificate, which can be viewed via theonline certificate lookup. Because the matter remains ongoing, TEA cannot comment further.\u201d Jump to comments \u2193 **Lesley Engle** **Andrew J.
