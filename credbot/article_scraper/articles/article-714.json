InBeing Jewish After the Destruction of Gaza, Beinart considers how a story of persecution and victimhood has come to dominate contemporary Jewish life, even as Israel is decimating the conditions of life for millions. That narrative, Beinart argues, both warps our understanding of Israel and Palestine and erases much of the nuance of Jewish religious tradition. After more than a year of Israel\u2019s bombardment of Gaza\u2014and the deployment of Jewish text and history to justify mass slaughter and starvation\u2014Beinart insists that Jews must tell a new story. After this war, whose horror will echo for generations, they must offer a new answer to the question: What does it mean to be a Jew? This event is taking place on May 13th in-person at the Woodstock Jewish Congregation, and will be livestreamed. It is free for WJC members and members ofJewish Currents, with an $18 donation for non-members. All proceeds benefit the Woodstock Jewish Congregation.Register here.
