The Chicago One Fair Wage ordinance, passed in October, will phase out Chicago\u2019s subminimum wages for tipped workers over a five-year period, impacting restaurants in all 77 neighborhoods. But activists and lawyers say the new legislation will not fix the city\u2019s inefficient and ineffective system for reporting tip and wage theft. \u201cEmployers will just find a different way to cheat \u2026I can walk into probably any restaurant in the United States and find at least one wage-an-hour violation.\u201d Existing bad actors will continue to take advantage of workers who do not fully understand the language of Chicago\u2019s minimum wage laws, said Douglas M. Werman, a lawyer at Werman Salas P.C., who has won his clients more than $400 million in work-related lawsuits. \u201cEmployers will just find a different way to cheat,\u201d he said. \u201cI can walk into probably any restaurant in the United States and find at least one wage-an-hour violation.\u201d Addressing the city\u2019s wage theft problem may require even more sweeping changes in government practices, said Jorge M\u00fajica, an organizer with Arise Chicago, an advocacy group for labor rights. The Cook County Minimum Wage Ordinance, passed in 2014, fined businesses if they were found in violation of wage laws, but more than three-quarters of the county\u2019s municipalities had opted out of the ordinance by 2017, according to a report by Illinois Policy, an independent advocacy group. By June 2023, 19 municipalities were following the ordinance and 117 had opted out according to Cook County\u2019s Department of Human Rights and Ethics. The county government currently has two investigators who are responsible for handling all human rights-related complaints and violations, said Cook County Department of Human Rights and Ethics Office Manager Kisha Johns. Cook County\u2019s Commission on Human Rights fielded 659 inquiries and filed 137 cases in 2022, according to the commission\u2019s annual report. The Cook County government, the Illinois Department of Labor and the Chicago Office of Labor Standards are understaffed and have limited resources to pursue wage-related complaints, said Wendy Pollack, the director of the Women\u2019s Law and Policy Initiative at the advocacy-focused Shriver Center on Poverty Law. The Department of Labor\u2019s form for tip theft reports requires workers to denote how much money has been stolen from them, but they often have no way of knowing because they never saw their tips in the first place, said M\u00fajica. M\u00fajica is working with primarily undocumented employees at local chains like Portillo\u2019s and tortilla manufacturer El Milagro who said that they have had their tips stolen. M\u00fajica is in favor of the new ordinance but said that many of his clients simply do not know how the local laws work. \u201cWorkers don\u2019t know their rights, they don\u2019t know the ordinances, and so they just obey what the employer says,\u201d he said. \u201cOne of our most important tasks here is to educate workers on their rights.\u201d Documented and Undocumented The Chicago Department of Business Affairs and Consumer Protection\u2019s Office of Labor Standards (OLS) received 104 reports of tip and wage theft in restaurants between when it began tracking complaints in 2020 and October 2023. The city reached 19 settlements with businesses in the food service industry between 2021 and 2022, totaling nearly $2 million in fines and restitution, according to an OLS report. Tri City Foods, which franchises several Chicago-area Burger King locations according to the Office of Labor Standards\u2019 report, was charged $100,000 in fines and $458,931 in recoupment in July 2021 for failing to grant 2,473 Chicago employees their paid sick leave. The fine was the largest in the history of the city\u2019s labor laws, according to a press release from the Office of Mayor Lori Lightfoot. Mondelez International, a Chicago-based food company that includes brands such as Oreo, Ritz and Toblerone, was ordered to pay $95,217 in fines and $479,083 in recoupment in May 2021 for sick leave violations. Legal and Labor experts believe that incidents of wage and tip theft reports are underreported. In a survey of tipped workers by the University of Illinois published in September, nearly 57% of respondents reported having been a victim of tip theft in the past week. The survey may not have reached undocumented workers or employees who are not native English speakers, said Alison Dickson, the lead author of the report and a labor market specialist. \u201cWe missed capturing the stories in the lowest-paid tip jobs in the city,\u201d she said. \u201cMy sense is that things are much worse.\u201d Tim Nolan, a Chicago-based lawyer at Nolan Law Office, said he has personally represented several hundred victims of tip and wage theft, many of them in the restaurant industry. Around 90% of Nolan\u2019s clients are undocumented immigrants who are afraid to file reports for fear of retaliation from employers, Nolan said. Instead, they reached confidential settlements with their former employers, Nolan said. \u201c[They\u2019re] typically terrified, because they think if they show up at a federal court, they\u2019re gonna get deported,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of employers will threaten them. If someone\u2019s gonna leave work because they don\u2019t think they\u2019re getting paid right, the employer has told many of my clients, \u2018I\u2019ll make sure to call the police, we\u2019ll get you deported.\u2019\u201d One ongoing wage theft complaint is a class action lawsuit against Jacqueline \u201cJackie\u201d Jackson, who owns three locations of Kilwin\u2019s Ice Cream in downtown Chicago, including one at Navy Pier. Over a dozen employees have accused her of violating the Federal Labor Standards Act, the Illinois Minimum Wage Law and the Chicago Minimum Wage Ordinance by withholding their pay based on arbitrary rules like not following the company dress code or using their cell phones during work hours. Jackson did not respond to a request for comment. In another active case, Zawlocki v. Partners\u2019 Tap, Inc., five employees of Morrison Roadhouse have accused owner Robert Castle of deducting money from their paychecks by offering regular customers free drinks. In a written statement provided by Billhorn Law Firm attorney Samuel Engelson the plaintiffs said that wage theft is underreported, and that the new ordinance is not a solution. A manager at Morrison Roadhouse declined a request for comment. A Controversial Vote The Chicago City Council voted in October to end subminimum wages by 2028. The current minimum wage for most workers in the city stands at $15.80 per hour, although tipped adult workers bring home between $9 and $9.48 per hour before tips are factored in, according to the City of Chicago\u2019s Business Affairs and Consumer Protection Office of Labor Standards. Wages will rise by 8% every year under the new ordinance until they reach parity with the minimum wage in 2028. The new ordinance will overhaul the existing system, which requires employers to make up the difference if workers\u2019 tips do not bring them over the minimum wage threshold. Although the ordinance passed by a margin of 36-10, it was a controversial vote. The Illinois Restaurant Association, an industry group headquartered in Chicago, lobbied heavily against the legislation before it was approved. Owners would have reduced profit margins and small restaurants could struggle to retain employees if they had to pay higher base salaries in place of tips, said Association Chairman Kevin Vaughan. Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson said in a press release that the new ordinance was \u201caddressing systemic inequalities in the restaurant and hospitality industries.\u201d Johnson did not respond to a request for comment. One of the ordinance\u2019s co-sponsors, 26th Ward Alderwoman Jessie Fuentes, said that subminimum wages should be abolished because many workers never receive the tips that they earned.
