Are state legislators pushing proposals that would expunge the criminal records of transgender individuals who change their legal names? While several prominent social media accounts have circulated this claim in recent weeks, there is no evidence to suggest these provisions were under consideration by state policymakers. On May 26, the Instagram account \u201cMentorHouse0,\u201d which has more than 500,000 followers, shared a55-second video clipfrom a June 2023 episode of businessman Patrick Bet-David\u2019s video podcast, the PBD Podcast. Thatepisode featuredInfowars\u2019 Alex Jones\u2014a well-known conspiracy theorist and the source ofseveralpreviousDispatch Fact Checkarticles\u2014as a guest. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to pass laws in California and other states where once you change your name, and if you\u2019re trans, it expunges your criminal record.\u201dJones saidin the episode. The viral video clip then shows Adam Sosnick, a financial advice podcaster affiliated with Bet-David, indicating Jones\u2019 claim was true. \u201cOh, yeah,\u201d he said. \u201cJust change your name, Alex. Now you\u2019re Alexandra Jones\u2014exonerated, you\u2019re good, you owe no money,\u201d Sosnick added, referring to the$1.4 billiona Connecticut jury ordered Jones to pay in 2022 to the families of victims killed in the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting following a defamation suit that centered around Jones\u2019 false claim that the massacre was a hoax. \u201cMentorHouse0\u201d did not identify who was speaking in the video clip, that it was taken from the PBD Podcast, or that the clip was nearly two years old. In its caption, it stated, \u201cCredits : Unknown.\u201d Later that day, the X account \u201cConcerned Citizen\u201d\u2014which has nearly 1 million followers and describes itself as a \u201cConspiracy Realist/Coincidence Analyzer\u201d\u2014tweeted outthe clip, and, in its caption, quoted Jones\u2019 claim about the provisions supposedly being pushed in California and other states. \u201cThis is so wrong,\u201d it stated. On May 27, \u201cDefiant L\u2019s\u201d\u2014an X account with 1.5 million followers and affiliated with the right-wing media group Resist the Mainstream\u2014shareda nearly identical tweet, adding, \u201cIf true, this is stupid beyond imagination.\u201d There is no evidence behind this claim. While some states have passed \u201cclean slate\u201d legislation in recent years expunging or sealing the records of some convicts, no state has a law doing so explicitly for individuals who undergo either a gender transition or a legal name change. Jones never specified which bill included the supposed provisions he claimed were being pushed. However, around the time the podcast was released, a California law expunging some criminal records was about to go into effect, and, separately, state legislators were considering a bill to make certain public records of transgender minors confidential. In September 2022, California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, signed into lawSenate Bill 731, also known as the \u201cClean Slate Law,\u201d which expanded the types of felony convictions that California would either seal from the public or expunge from that individual\u2019s criminal record. The statute wentinto effecton July 1, 2023, one week after the PBD Podcast episode aired. Under the law, convicted felons who were not sex offenders or found guilty of \u201cserious\u201d or \u201cviolent\u201d crimes would see their arrest and conviction records sealed or expunged from public view four years following their conviction, unless they were convicted of a separate felony charge in that time. The criminal history for convicted felons who have their records sealed or expunged under the law is still accessible in background checks for those applying to work in education, law enforcement, or seeking a seat in public office. The law would also not interfere with law enforcement\u2019s ability to access an individual\u2019s criminal history. Furthermore, longstanding California statelaw barssome felons from holding statewide and local public office, and those individuals are still considered ineligible to hold public office under the \u201cClean Slate Law.\u201d A separate piece of legislation that California policymakers were also considering wasAssembly Bill 223, dubbed the \u201cTransgender Youth Privacy Act,\u201d introduced by Democratic State Assemblymember Chris Ward in January 2023. The bill made itout of committeeon June 13, 2023\u201411 days before the podcast aired\u2014and was signed into law by Newsom in September of that year. But the \u201cTransgender Youth Privacy Act\u201d did not expunge the criminal record of transgender individuals. Ward\u2019s office confirmed that this law made confidential all records relating to a legal name or gender change for individuals under 18 years old, stating to theDispatch Fact Checkthat its primary purpose was \u201cprotecting the privacy of a minor.\u201d As Ward explained when heintroduced thebill, it was intended to ensure that transgender minors in California can live \u201cwithout fear of retaliation from someone who discovers that information in the public record.\u201d Ward\u2019s office explained that any statement claiming the law expunged criminal offenses from the public record was \u201cfalse,\u201d and that the bill only sealed petitions filed by a minor to change their gender or sex identifier and name, as well as \u201cany paper associated with the proceedings.\u201d The Dispatch Fact Checkhas reached out toInfowarsand Patrick Bet-David\u2019s company Valuetainment with a request for comment.
