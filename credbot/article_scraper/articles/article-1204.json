I am a Resident Senior Fellow in the Technology and Innovation program at the R Street Institute. The R Street Institute is a nonprofit, nonpartisan public policy research organization. Our mission is to engage in policy research and outreach to promote free markets and limited, effective government in many areas, including emerging technology. This is why SB 46: \u201cAn Act to Amend Title 21 of the Delaware Code Relating to Autonomous Vehicles,\u201d is of particular interest to our organization. The bill would prohibit certain autonomous vehicles (AVs) from being operated on Delaware roads without a human safety operator being physically present within the vehicle. Such a \u201cdriver-in\u201d mandate would discourage cutting-edge AV innovation in the state of Delaware and, by extension, undermine road safety. America needs a road safety revolution.[1]Simple tweaks to traditional safety regulations are not sufficient. Unfortunately, public roads in Delaware and across the nation are more dangerous than ever. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, more than 42,000 people died in motor vehicle traffic crashes in 2022, and the totals have been rising in recent years compared to the previous decade.[2]Traffic fatalities have risen in a similar way in Delaware.[3] There are many factors that contribute to this dismal result, but the major culprits are various types of human driver error including driver distraction, impairment, speeding, and road rage.[4]For example, despite years of government efforts to counter it, alcohol-related driving fatalities are rising in Delaware and the rest of the nation.[5] Therefore, while proposals like SB 46 are well-intentioned, driver-in regulatory requirements are not the way to achieve greater roadway safety. In fact, such regulations could actually undermine safety goals. The promise of AVs is precisely that they will help minimize human error behind the wheel. AVs should not be held to an unreasonable standard of being vastly superior to human-driven vehicles before lawmakers allow them to be deployed widely without human drivers inside.[6]Some scholars refer to this as \u201crobophobia,\u201d and observe that, \u201c[i]f governments restrict the use of driverless cars, the effect might be to limit fatalities associated with driverless cars, but that outcome is desirable only if driverless cars produce more fatalities than cars with drivers,\u201d and that is clearly not the case.[7] Current data suggests AVs are already considerably safer than human drivers, which makes such robophobia dangerous for public safety outcomes.[8]A new peer-reviewed report from Swiss Reinsurance Co. and other technical labs found that Waymo robotaxis \u201csignificantly outperformed \u2026 the overall driving population\u201d with an 88-percent drop in property-damage claims and a 92-percent drop in bodily-injury claims.[9]Summarizing the significance of these findings, one economist observed that these results mean that current generation AV robotaxis are 10 times safer than human drivers, and that this rate of safety improvement is doubling roughly every five years.[10]Even in the rare cases where AVs have been involved in some crashes, human drivers have been to blame for the majority of them.[11] AV policy flexibility is also an important way to help expand transportation market options for industry and the public alike.[12]It would be particularly counter-productive to impose driver-in mandates at a time when the nation is facing a truck driver shortage.[13]AV advancement might eventually be able to help alleviate that problem. Prohibiting the use of AV technology in semi-trucks could also undermine freight delivery options to the public, which would also raise costs. Importantly, lawmakers should also be aware that any state action that undermines the vibrancy of the American AV industry can have broader ramifications for our nation\u2019s competitiveness with China\u2019s AV industry growing rapidly.[14]Experts note that \u201cChina wants to win this race,\u201d and \u201cto be out ahead with this technology.\u201d[15] Notably, during his recent United States Senate confirmation hearing to become the next head of the Department of Transportation, Sean Duffy stressed the importance of AVs as part of a new class of transportation technologies America needs to work to advance because \u201cwe are in a global race to out-innovate the rest of the world.\u201d[16]For this reason, Duffy noted in response to questions, AV innovation must also be seen as a national security issue. Throughout the confirmation hearing several Senators echoed his concerns. Again, misguided state regulation of the AV marketplace could counter that goal while also undermining roadway safety more generally. Delaware should look to become a leader in AV innovation and avoid regulatory mandates that would undermine safety and security objectives. The state should instead be considering legislative approaches like those in effect in other states, which create a more flexible legal framework for AV testing and operations. For these reasons, I encourage you and the House Republican Caucus to oppose SB 46.
