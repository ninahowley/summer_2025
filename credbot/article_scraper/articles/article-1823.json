But he could not, for lack of courage.\" ByCallie Byrnes Updated 13 minutes ago,June 11, 2025 In The Mood For Love, the 2000 masterpiece by acclaimed filmmaker Wang Kar-Wai, officially turns 25 this year, and in celebration, the movie has returned to theaters for movie lovers to experience it again on the big screen. The film, known for its quiet yearning and heartache, revolves around Chow Mo-wan (Tony Leung) and Su Li-zhen Chan (Maggie Cheung), a man and a woman who are married to different people but learn that their spouses are having an affair with each other. The two grow closer as they try to understand why their partners would betray them\u2014and in their quest to ward off the loneliness, they instead find love. The dialogue in the film is gut-punching, and it\u2019s often what\u2019s left unsaid that speaks the loudest. Here are the 10 best quotes fromIn The Mood For Love: **1.** Title Card: It is a restless moment. She has kept her head lowered, to give him a chance to come closer. But he could not, for lack of courage. She turns and walks away. **2.** Chow Mo-wan (Tony Leung): In the old days, if someone had a secret they didn\u2019t want to share, you know what they did? Ah Ping (Ping-Lam Siu): Have no idea. Chow Mo-wan: They went up a mountain, found a tree, carved a hole in it, and whispered the secret into the hole. Then they covered it with mud. And leave the secret there forever. **3.** Su Li-zhen Chan (Maggie Cheung): You notice things if you pay attention. **4.** Chow Mo-wan (Tony Leung): Someone must have made the first move. Su Li-zhen Chan (Maggie Cheung): It doesn\u2019t matter who made the first move. **5.** Chow Mo-wan (Tony Leung): I thought we wouldn\u2019t be like them. But I was wrong. **6.** Su Li-zhen Chan (Maggie Cheung): Look at me, do you have a mistress? Chow Mo-wan (Tony Leung): Yes! Su Li-zhen Chan: I didn\u2019t expect it to hurt that much. Chow Mo-wan: This is just a rehearsal. **7.** Su Li-zhen Chan (Maggie Cheung): Why did you call me at the office today? Chow Mo-wan (Tony Leung): I had nothing to do. I wanted to hear your voice. **8.** Chow Mo-wan (Tony Leung): I sometimes wonder what I\u2019d be if I hadn\u2019t married. Have you ever thought of that? Su Li-zhen Chan (Maggie Cheung): Maybe happier. I didn\u2019t know married life would be so complicated. When you\u2019re single, you are only responsible to yourself. Once you\u2019re married, doing well on your own is not enough. **9.** Chow Mo-wan (Tony Leung): I can\u2019t waste my time wondering if I made mistakes. Life\u2019s too short for that. Something must change. **10.** Su Li-zhen Chan (Maggie Cheung): I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d fall in love with me. Chow Mo-wan (Tony Leung): I didn\u2019t either. I was only curious to know how it started. Now I know. Feelings can creep up just like that. I thought I was in control. Read moreTV + Movies.
