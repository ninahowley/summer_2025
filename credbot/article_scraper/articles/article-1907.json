Dozens. Hundreds. Thousands. Each of these words denotes vastly different quantities. They all provide important information in war coverage where numbers play an important role. For instance, an Oct. 30 Reuters headline states: \u201cIsraeli strike kills dozens in north Gaza residential block, US calls incident \u2018horrifying.\u2019\u201c The first paragraphs of Nidal Al-Mughrabi\u2019s accompanying story provide more details about the dozens of reported fatalities: At least 93 Palestinians were killed or missing and dozens wounded in an Israeli strike on a residential building in the northern Gaza town of Beit Lahiya on Tuesday, the Gaza health ministry said, and the U.S. called the incident \u201chorrifying\u201d. Medics said at least 20 children were among the dead. \u201cA number of victims are still under the rubble and on the roads, and ambulance and civil defence crews cannot reach them,\u201d the territory\u2019s health ministry said in a statement. Later on Tuesday, Ismail Al-Thawabta, director of the Gaza government media office, put the number of fatalities at 93. That\u2019s a great deal of emphasis on numbers. Clearly, numbers are newsworthy, and their accurate depiction is essential for reliable reporting. Thus, with regard to the 93 Palestinians reported killed or missing, Reuters\u2019 headline rightly refers to \u201cdozens,\u201d not \u201ca few.\u201d Yet, when it comes to thethousandsof UNRWA staffers whom Israel has accused of holding membership in terror organizations, withhundredsof them said to be serving as military operatives, Reuters\u2019 recounting of numbers suddenly lacks the precision which characterized the reporting of the reported Palestinian fatalities. Not only does Al-Mughrabi fail to report the actual number, but his stand in for the figure is downright false. Thus, Al-Mughrabi grossly underreports the number of UNRWA employees that Israel has said belong to terror organizations, erring: Israeli officials citedthe involvement of a handful of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees\u2019 thousands of staffers in the Oct. 7, 2023 attack anda few staffers\u2019 membership in Hamas and other armed groups.[Emphasis added.] \u201cFew\u201dmeansa small number. And yet Israel has accusedmore than 2000UNRWA staffers of belonging to terror organizations. \u201cFew\u201d is not a fair stand in for more than 90 reported fatalities, and Reuters rightly cited \u201cdozens\u201d in that case. All the more so, \u201cfew\u201d is a false representation of more than 450 reported UNRWA staffers who moonlight as military operatives. With respect to more than 2000, which is how many UNRWA staffers Israel has accused of possessing membership in Hamas or other terror organizations (either as military operatives or otherwise), \u201cfew\u201d is a farce. As Reuters itself reported in March, Israel cited more than 450 UNRWA employees moonlighting for Hamasas military operatives(\u201cIsrael says over 450 UN aid agency workers in Gaza are \u2018military operatives\u201c). Reuters reported at the time: Israel\u2019s military said on Monday that the U.N. aid agency UNRWA in Gaza employed over 450 \u201cmilitary operatives\u201d from Hamas and other armed groups, and that Israel has shared this intelligence with the United Nations. . . . \u201cOver 450 UNRWA employees are military operatives in terror groups in Gaza. Over 450. This is no mere coincidence. This is systematic. There is no claiming \u2018We did not know\u2019,\u201d military spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari told reporters in a briefing. \u201cWe sent the information that I am sharing now, as well as further intelligence, to our international partners, including the U.N.,\u201d he said. #Breaking: IDF Spokesperson releases a full statement on UNRWA: \u201cOver 450@UNRWAemployees are military operatives in terror groups in Gaza\u2026 This is no mere coincidence, this is systematic. There is no claiming: \u2018we didn\u2019t know.'\u201dpic.twitter.com/hJFHZA86ps \u2014 Open Source Intel (@Osint613)March 5, 2024 Moreover, Israel\u2019s Foreign Ministry has cited more than 2,315 UNRWA employees with membership in Hamas or Islamic Jihad \u2014 meaning both \u201cmilitary operatives\u201d and members with non-combat positions (administrative, finance, propaganda, social welfare, education, etc).Voice of Americaquoted Adi Farjon, deputy permanent representative of Israel to the United Nations in Geneva: \u201cFor example, it is a fact, that 19 members of the organization took an active part in the October 7 terrorist attack. It is also a fact that more than 2,135 UNRWA workers in Gaza are members of either Hamas or Palestinian Islamic Jihad,\u201d she said. Last week, CAMERA contacted Reuters reminding editors of its own coverage of Israel\u2019s information concerning the several hundred UNRWA employees who double as terror operatives, and also informing the news agency about the Foreign Ministry\u2019s information regarding 2,135 UNRWA staffers who belong to terror groups. Yet, as of this writing, Reuters has failed to rectify the \u201cfew\u201d falsehood. Reducing thousands to a few gives readers a \u201cfew\u201d reasons to question Reuters\u2019stated commitmentto trust, integrity and freedom of bias. TheArabic versionof the same Reuters article also grossly underreports the number of UNRWA employees Israel has accused of belonging to terror groups. It says that \u201ca small number of staffers joined Hamas and other armed groups.\u201d Share on: Facebook Twitter Pinterest Comments are closed. **CAMERA Author** Tamar SternthalTamar Sternthal is director of CAMERA\u2019s Israel Office.
