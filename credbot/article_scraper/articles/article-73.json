The legislation was drafted by the personal attorney of Republican Gov. Jeff Landry, who faces charges brought by the board for violating state ethics laws. Proponents say the measures give those accused of ethics violations more opportunities to respond to allegations, increases transparency and limits abuses of a process they claim is often unjust. But watchdog groups \u2014 and the Board of Ethics \u2014 warn the changes will undermine the board\u2019s ability to hold public officials accountable. While the changes would not apply to Landry\u2019s current charges, the legislation further bolsters the governor\u2019s power over a state board largely made up of his own appointees. Having overwhelmingly passed in the House and Senate this week \u2014 only three lawmakers voted against it \u2014 the bill awaits Landry\u2019s signature. **Email newsletter signup** Republican Rep. Gerald \u201cBeau\u201d Beaullieu, who sponsored the bill, said it was brought forth after officials complained that the board\u2019s investigation process was \u201cmore like being investigated by the Gestapo.\u201d Landry\u2019s office declined to comment. Another bill would share the names of complainants with officials they are accusing of wrongdoing, as well as limit the board\u2019s ability to launch investigations. Governor\u2019s lawyer behind legislation Landry\u2019s private attorney, Stephen Gel\u00e9, drafted the legislation, which the governor supports. Gel\u00e9 is defending Landry against ethics charges brought in 2023 for undisclosed free plane rides to Hawaii when he served as the state\u2019s attorney general. Gel\u00e9 said negotiations are progressing to \u201camicably resolve the charges.\u201d Last year, Gel\u00e9 warned lawmakers that the ethics board\u2019s investigatory powers are \u201cdangerous, unwarranted, and threaten well-established fundamental constitutional rights\u201d and he has sought to rein them in with new legislation. The bill\u2019s supporters say it gives the board more discretion about whether to pursue investigations and bring charges, cuts down on waste of taxpayer dollars and strengthens due process rights for the accused. Yet these changes are raising red flags. In a letter to lawmakers, the Board of Ethics warned that the bill\u2019s requirement to share copies of all subpoenas with officials under investigation allows them to \u201cinfluence a witness\u2019s documents or responses.\u201d Critics say the bill undercuts the board\u2019s authority by granting local courts the power to quash investigations, gives officials opportunities to run out the clock on the board\u2019s one-year timeline to bring charges and prevents the board from investigating violations that were disclosed by public officials seeking the board\u2019s advisory opinion. The bill also requires a two-thirds board vote to approve an investigation into a sworn complaint and another two-thirds vote on whether to file charges. Current policy requires only majority votes. Barry Erwin, president of the Council for a Better Louisiana, a nonpartisan government accountability group, said the bill\u2019s two-thirds vote requirements constitute a \u201chigh bar to overcome\u201d for a board of political appointees. \u201cI just think in real life, in very political situations, it\u2019s hard for some of these board members to act with the independence in the system we had before,\u201d Erwin said. A bill that will reduce complaints The other bill under consideration \u2014 which Gel\u00e9 said he did not craft and Landry has not publicly supported \u2014 would require anyone bringing an ethics complaint to disclose their name and file the complaint in person at the ethics board offices in Baton Rouge. The bill passed in the House with only seven lawmakers opposed and is pending final passage in the Senate. In a legislative committee hearing, David Bordelon, general counsel for the ethics board, warned that the bill would enable officials \u201cto intimidate a witness or potentially alter information that\u2019s requested.\u201d Bordelon said the measure would \u201cdrastically reduce the number of complaints.\u201d The legislation\u2019s sponsor, Republican Rep. Kellee Hennessey Dickerson, said her bill is part of a fight for \u201ctruth\u201d and \u201cjustice.\u201d \u201cFor those of us who have been through it, it helps develop peace of mind, knowing who your accuser is, especially when you are spending thousands upon thousands of dollars to try and clear your good name,\u201d said Dickerson, who was fined $1,500 for an ethics violation in 2023. She argued people frequently file complaints to harass their political opponents. Bordelon countered that the board dispassionately evaluates complaints and provides the accused with the opportunity to defend themselves if charges are brought. The bill also prevents the ethics board from launching investigations based on non-governmental sources such as media reports. Governor dominates state ethics board Following legislation passed last year, the governor directly appoints nine of the board\u2019s 15 members, with the Legislature appointing the rest. Officials with the legislative and executive branches now have more control over those who may be tasked with investigating them, watchdogs note. \u201cIt\u2019s gone from a process that was as much arm\u2019s length away from politics as we could make it, and we had it that way for many years, to a process now that is very much more political than we\u2019ve ever seen it,\u201d Erwin said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be very difficult for the board to act in a way that guarantees that kind of oversight we want to have.\u201d **Featured Local Savings** **You Might Like** **Poncho back with Cowgirls | American Press** **Poncho back with Cowgirls | American Press** **Recently paroled local man charged with rape | American Press** **Recently paroled local man charged with rape | American Press** **NCAA settlement fallout: McNeese has NIL plan as it enters new economic era | American Press** **NCAA settlement fallout: McNeese has NIL plan as it enters new economic era | American Press** **At 100, Emma Frazier still helps at church and visits residents in nursing homes | American Press** **At 100, Emma Frazier still helps at church and visits residents in nursing homes | American Press** Special Sections **Special Sections** **Special Sections** Home News ObituariesMemorials Memorials Memorials Sports Opinion Health Small Business Celebrations E-Edition Subscriptions Jobs/Recruiting About Us"}
