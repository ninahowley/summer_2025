No injuries were reported. According to the Ca\u00f1on City Police Department, officers were dispatched to Walmart at about 5:15 p.m. on a report of shots fired. On arrival, officers were able to ascertain from witnesses that occupants of a vehicle were engaged in some type of verbal dispute that led to a male occupant in the car to fire several shots at a group of people, the CCPD stated in a social media post. The vehicle fled the scene prior to officers arriving. The vehicle was located quickly with the help of Fremont County deputies. The suspect, John Elliott, 56, was taken into custody and transported to the Fremont County Detention Center. He is being held on charges of criminal attempt \u2013 first-degree assault. This is an ongoing and active investigation. Any witnesses to this event are encouraged to call and report that information to Det. Taryn Leonard at 719-276-5600. **Share this:** Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Facebook Click to share on X (Opens in new window)X **RevContent Feed** **Events** **Most Popular**
