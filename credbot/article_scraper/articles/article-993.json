Interference from the thousands of Starlink satellites in orbit, where they provide a global internet service, has been a continuing concern for astronomers, who say that the radio emissions from the craft could affect sensitive telescopes that observe distant, and faint, radio sources. SpaceX has workedwith astronomersto try to prevent this interference, by switching off their internet-transmitting beams when they fly over key telescopes, but it turns out that this isn\u2019t enough.

This planned collection of more than 100,000 small, linked telescopes is currently under construction to study the early universe, but the researchers found that this goal could be threatened by Starlink signals affecting up to a third of the data taken at some frequencies. They also found that the satellites were emitting signals at two frequency ranges that are protected for radio astronomy by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), and so shouldn\u2019t be used by Starlink. However, it is thought that these satellite transmissions are unintentional. The leaking emissions are 10,000 times stronger than faint radio signals from neutral hydrogen clouds that existed when the first stars began to form, signals that astronomers hope to observe in order to understand the early universe. \u201cIf you look at the signal strength produced by these unintended emissions, it\u2019s not unusual for them to be comparable to the brightest natural radio sources in the sky,\u201d says Tingay. \u201cIt\u2019s like taking the strongest sources in the sky and putting a bunch more artificial ones in the sky and making them move around a lot \u2014 that has a lot of impact, especially on experiments that seek to be ultra-sensitive.\u201d Voyage across the galaxy and beyond with our space newsletter every month. The emissions are probably coming from onboard electronics that are accidentally transmitting signals through the satellite\u2019s antenna, says Tingay. Such leakage isn\u2019t technically illegal, as the ITU regulations only cover intentional emissions, he says. \u201cNo one\u2019s breaking any rules from SpaceX or Starlink \u2014 these types of emissions are not regulated,\u201d says Tingay. \u201cBut it is starting to become a discussion in the ITU as to how regulations over this type of emission could be introduced.\u201d The ITU declined to comment.

Grigg and Tingay have already shared their results with SpaceX and say that the company has been open to a dialogue on finding a way to reduce emissions. SpaceX didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. If SpaceX can\u2019t find a solution, then researchers will need to introduce algorithmic solutions to filter out the polluting radio waves. However, such efforts are still at an \u201cembryonic stage\u201d, says Tingay, and could require amounts of computing power equivalent to or more than that needed to do the basic processing of astronomical signals of interest in the first place, he says.
