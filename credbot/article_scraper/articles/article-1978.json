Literature indicates that children and youth of all ages are struggling to attend school regularly, leading to problematic outcomes both concurrently and across time. As well, research demonstrates that children and youth who experience mental health challenges are at greater risk of increased school absenteeism rates. The present study investigated the school attendance patterns of Canadian children and youth and the longitudinal and bidirectional links with mental health challenges within the COVID-19 pandemic context. The study sample consisted of 72 children and youth, using parent reports. Parents were asked to complete an online questionnaire which included questions about the demographic characteristics of themselves and their child, their child's school attendance patterns, and their child's mental health challenges. Preliminary descriptive statistics were run in relation to school absenteeism. Two separate path analyses were conducted to determine the longitudinal links between school absenteeism and mental health (split into externalizing and internalizing behaviours) across two timepoints (Time 1 [T1]: Fall 2022, Time 2 [T2]: Spring 2023). These analyses indicated concurrent links between mentalhealth difficulties and school absenteeism. Importantly, path analyses also showed that absenteeism at T1 predicted poorer mental health at T2, indicating that school absenteeism may be one of the driving factors in the causal relationship. A bidirectional effect was found between externalizing behaviours at T1 and absenteeism rates at T2. The reasons for school absenteeism were examined across each time point and for both the externalizing and internalizing groups separately. The present study highlights the complex interplay between mental health and school absenteeism in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.
