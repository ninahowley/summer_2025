(WXYZ) \u2014 The City of Ann Arbor is facing backlash after confirming that beavers living in a creek at the city-owned Leslie Park Golf Course were euthanized, sparking disappointment from animal lovers and wildlife advocates. Watch Sarah Michals' video report: City officials say the beavers had been building a dam in a section of the creek that is part of the Washtenaw County Drain system, and that their activity posed a risk of flooding and property damage. But some residents say more humane alternatives should have been explored. \u201cMy initial response is they should have tried other things first,\u201dsaid nearby resident Kelley Fawcett. \u201cThey could have just relocated them. They didn\u2019t have to kill them,\u201dsaid Alex Craig. \u201cIt\u2019s really disappointing that that\u2019s the direction the city went with it,\u201dadded Carrie Henderson. Even at the golf course itself, evidence of past beaver activity remains, though no beavers are currently in sight. \u201cI feel like there could have been a more humane way of handling that,\u201dsaid Lydia Tice.\u201cGetting people in, and removing them (the beavers) and putting them somewhere better where they can actually thrive. Not just outright killing them.\u201d 7 News Detroit reached out to Ann Arbor's Parks department for a better understanding of why the decision was made to kill the animals. The Community Services Administrator for the city emailed back saying: Under Michigan DNR regulations, property owners are allowed to kill certain nuisance wildlife, including beavers, rabbits, and squirrels, if the animals are actively causing or threatening to cause damage. While the DNR does not issue permits to trap and relocate beavers, the agency does provide prevention and control strategieshereto help manage beaver populations and dam-related water flow. Despite that, many residents feel the city\u2019s actions were unnecessary. \u201cIt just sounds like a more convenient option to kill them than to try and relocate them or preserve the wildlife here,\u201d Craig said. \u201cI just think it\u2019s kind of lazy of them to do that,\u201d added Tice. The Humane Society of Huron Valley also weighed in, posting on social media: \u201cThis has made a lot of folks sad, and certainly us, too. We are dedicated to nonviolent solutions whenever there are problems with wildlife.\u201d Some advocates are now calling for more public education and better policies around how wild animals are handled in urban spaces. \u201cI think more education, and more, potentially, rehabilitation for these animals, would be perfect,\u201dsaid resident Hannah Wiles. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 This story was reported by a journalist and has been converted to this platform with the assistance of AI.
