The Bank of England will decide whether to cut interest rates from their current level of 4.25 per cent next week Some major banks are cuttingmortgage ratesat the same time others are upping them in turbulent times for the market. From Wednesday (11 June), Barclays will raise rates by 0.2 percentage points across its fixed rate products, while HSBC will make similar changes. But NatWest is cutting some rates from Wednesday as well, with reductions of up to 0.23 percentage points. The changes to rates come a week before the nextBank of England interest ratedecision. The base rate currently stands at 4.25 per cent. Mortgage rates generally go down when there are expectations that interest rates will be cut further. This is because this sends swap rates \u2013 the rates at which banks lend to one another \u2013 down. **Read Next** **Where Rachel Reeves's spending cuts will hurt the most - in charts** **Where Rachel Reeves's spending cuts will hurt the most - in charts** TheBank of Englandhas cut interest rates twice already this year, and this has correlated with mortgage rates being reduced. Although previously there had been an expectation that interest rates could get below 4 per cent in 2025, these are no longer as prevalent and someexperts say there could be just one more cut. In turn, this has stopped the speed of mortgage rate reductions from being as fast and has pushed some rates up. Experts say that the general trend is that rates are going up, but that some lenders are having to use their \u201cown strategy\u201d to keep customers coming to them. Aaron Strutt of Trinity Financial said: \u201cThere is a mixture of changes but there is no getting away from the fact most rates are going up. There are also fewer sub-4 per cent fixes.\u201d Nick Mendes of John Charcol brokers said: \u201cBroadly speaking the bigger high-street names seem to be holding firm for now, clearly keen to stay competitive and keep volumes ticking over. \u201cMeanwhile, a few others have started tweaking their rates or tightening criteria just to balance the books especially those with less wiggle room on margins. \u201cIt\u2019s a classic case of every lender having its own strategy, really. The larger players can afford to ride it out and play the long game, while others are having to be a bit nimbler. So what could happen to mortgage rates in the future? Brokers aren\u2019t sure, but expect they could stay steady or begin to fall. \u201cIf swaps stay steady, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see a few more competitive offers creeping in,\u201d says Mr Mendes. Elliott Culley of Switch Mortgage Finance added: \u201cSome lenders may increase rates to reduce business levels for a short period of time whilst others decrease them to obtain more business. It likely won\u2019t stay like this for long though.\u201d The Bank of England will decide whether to cut interest rates from their current level next Thursday 19 June. Economists widely expect rates will be held at 4.25 per cent. The day before this, on Wednesday 18 June, the Office for National Statistics will unveil the latest inflation data. Economists generally think that the consumer prices index measure of inflation will fall marginally \u2013 to around 3.4 per cent \u2013 but a much bigger drop could lead to swap rates falling. Conversely, a large rise could lead to swap rates rising, which could potentially push mortgage rates upwards. Although there are cheaper rate best buys available, the average two-year fix is 5.13 per cent and the average five-year is 5.1 per cent, according to Moneyfacts. **EXPLORE MORE ON THE TOPICS IN THIS STORY** **MOST READ BY SUBSCRIBERS** **Austria school shooter who killed ten was 21-year-old former pupil, police say** **Where temperatures are set to soar to 29\u00b0C - as thunderstorm warnings loom** **BBC insiders fear Russia will fill void after World Service cuts** **Be in no doubt: Putin has Britain in his sights** **I\u2019m suffering \u2018micro stress\u2019 \u2013 but there is a simple way to cope** **Winter fuel U-turn solves one headache for Starmer but creates two more** **Editor's Picks** **8 things we've learned from the spending review - and what they mean for you** **'Boil in a bag' funerals will challenge British squeamishness about death** **At 63, I\u2019m fitter than ever - after a lifetime of cigs and booze** **Most Popular** **Where Rachel Reeves's spending cuts will hurt the most - in charts** **I keep \u00a3200 cash in my underwear drawer - here's why you should do the same** **How much will a combined income of \u00a374k affect our winter fuel payment?** **Inheritance tax changes could lead to further probate delays, experts warn** **The vulnerable groups that could miss out despite winter fuel U-turn** **500,000 more pensioners will miss out on winter fuel payments by 2030** **I bought our London home for \u00a3390k in 2018 \u2013 six years later, it sold for the same price** **The strategy that could wipe thousands off your pension - what is pound-cost ravaging?** **My income is topped up with universal credit.
