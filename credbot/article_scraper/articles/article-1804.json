Mathematical Patterns Reveal Election Database Manipulation |646|** **Painstaking analysis of algorithms designed to manage and obscure elections.** Podcast:Play in new window|Download Subscribe:RSS In Skeptiko episode 646 Dr. Andrew Paquette returns with overwhelming evidence of voter registration database manipulation across America. Through painstaking analysis, Andrew Paquette has uncovered evidence of sophisticated algorithms designed to manage and obscure irregular voter records across multiple states. His findings suggest something far more systematic than occasional duplicate registrations or clerical errors. **The Evidence Trail** **1. Multiple States, Multiple Algorithms** Paquette has identified distinct algorithmic patterns in New York, New Jersey, Wisconsin, parts of Ohio and Texas, Pennsylvania, and Arizona. The complexity varies by state: \u201cNew York has still the most sophisticated algorithm that I\u2019ve seen\u2026 New Jersey has not terribly complex, but an extremely well hidden algorithm\u2026 Hawaii is the most obvious of all of them\u2026 Wisconsin has something, Ohio has something, Texas does. Texas and Ohio both are limited in range or scope\u2026 they seem to only affect a few counties as opposed to the whole state.\u201d **2. Scale of the Issue** The numbers involved suggest systematic rather than incidental problems: \u201cThe initial count was something like 700,000 of these [clone records]. After leaving the group I was working with and doing more research, I\u2019ve raised that number. It\u2019s closer to 2 million now\u2026 In some cases, it\u2019s somewhere in the neighborhood of 15 to 20% of all records are fraudulent at this point.\u201d **3. Sophisticated Concealment Methods** The algorithms appear specifically designed to hide irregular records while maintaining access: \u201cThe way it\u2019s joined is a piece of information that can be used to identify records\u2026 it\u2019s completely invisible because it\u2019s not altering the numbers at all\u2026 It\u2019s just the way they\u2019re associated with each other, which is a very clever thing to do\u2026 there\u2019s really only one reason to do it is to obfuscate something.\u201d **4. Legal Implications** The systems appear to violate existing election law requirements: \u201cThis eliminates transparency. The whole purpose of these algorithms is obfuscation. So it does violate NVRA on that basis, and I believe HAVA, which is the Help America Vote Act as well.\u201d **The Deeper Battle** On a deeper level, this investigation points to a fundamental battle between truth and deception in our electoral systems. As Paquette himself notes: \u201cThe biggest problem plaguing society in the entire world and humanity actually is lies\u2026 when I pray these days, I figure, you know, the one prayer that covers basically everything is, I want truth to descend on this world.\u201d **Why This Matters Now** The discovery of these algorithmic patterns isn\u2019t just about past elections \u2013 it\u2019s about the integrity of our entire democratic process moving forward. These aren\u2019t simple duplicates or clerical errors that can be explained away by administrative oversight. They represent a sophisticated system of database manipulation that appears intentionally designed to evade detection. While some might argue that identifying problems without proving specific instances of fraud isn\u2019t helpful, this misses the point entirely. The mere existence of these algorithmic patterns in voter registration databases represents a violation of election law and transparency requirements. It\u2019s like discovering a secret door in a bank vault \u2013 the mere presence of the door is a security breach, regardless of whether you can prove it\u2019s been used for theft.
