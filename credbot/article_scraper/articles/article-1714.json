Somebody at Politico was having fun with their title \u2014 **Beer-soaked nationalist rally in rural France turns into Marine Le Pen love-fest** Here are two normal-sounding paragraphs \u2014 An all-star lineup of European nationalists including Hungary\u2019s Viktor Orb\u00e1n, Italy\u2019s Matteo Salvini, Czechia\u2019s Andrej Babi\u0161 and Spain\u2019s Santiago Abascal joined Le Pen in the small village of Mormant-sur-Vernisson, population 133, tocelebrate one year since the parties that make up the Patriots for Europe group scored a major win in the European election. Organizers said more than 6,000 people were in attendance, mostly supporters of Le Pen\u2019s National Rally from the local area, with some traveling from further afield. And \u2014 The strongest words of support for Le Pen came from Hungary\u2019s Viktor Orb\u00e1n, who made the 1,200-kilometer trip to France to back his ally. Orb\u00e1n lauded his \u201clong-time friend\u201d as a \u201ccourageous fighter\u201d who \u201cdoesn\u2019t betray\u201d and \u201cdoesn\u2019t let you down.\u201d *** C\u2019est aujourd\u2019hui la f\u00eate de la Victoire \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\uddf5\ud83d\udcaa avec les alli\u00e9s Europ\u00e9ens \ud83d\udcaa On vous attend nombreux a#MormantSurVernisson\ud83d\udcaa Qui y sera ?#TousAvecLeRNpic.twitter.com/EQEEhv9EpO \u2014 Tous avec le RN (@marinejordanrn)June 9, 2025 \ud83d\udea8 C\u2019est dans 3 jours.

But what makes Hungary interesting is its politics. We are the black sheep of the European Union. Brussels\u2019 nightmare. The hope of Europe\u2019s patriots. And the last bastion of Christians.\u201d Orb\u00e1n acknowledged the historical distance between Hungary and France, but said the nations are now united in a shared struggle.Recalling esteemed French writer Victor Hugo\u2019s praise of Hungarian heroism and philosopher Albert Camus\u2019 words about the 1956 Hungarian Uprising, he cast Hungary as a nation forged in resistance \u2014 and today, once again resisting ideological occupation. \u201cI was born in a communist dictatorship under Soviet occupation. We had to fight for freedom and democracy,\u201d he said. \u201cThe intellectual bureaucrats in Brussels who criticize Hungary have no idea what it means to fight for your country.\u201d \ud83c\udded\ud83c\uddfa@PM_ViktorOrban: \u201cWhat is happening is not migration. It\u2019s an organized exchange of people to replace Europe\u2019s cultural base. \u201cFor us, \u20ac1 million a day is a lot of money, but we\u2019d rather pay than let anyone in illegally. It\u2019s the best investment for the future.\u201dpic.twitter.com/AZi3Yqqfl8 \u2014 Remix News & Views (@RMXnews)June 9, 2025 The Hungarian leader accused Brussels and Western elites of attempting todismantle national identity, Christianity, and the family.He said Hungary had witnessed a cultural siege over the past two decades, with global corporations, progressive NGOs, and foreign-funded media taking over national institutions. \u201cFor them, the family, the nation, and Christianity were just a joke,\u201d he said. He outlined his government\u2019s response: a new constitution that enshrines national sovereignty and Christian values, a total rejection of illegal migration, and laws that define \u201ca father as a man and a mother as a woman.\u201d He said that protecting children now takes precedence over all other rights, and that illegal border crossings are treated as crimes. \u201cOnly those with prior authorization may enter Hungarian territory,\u201d he said. ************ **\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022** The Liberty Beacon Projectis now expanding at a near exponential rate, and for this we are grateful and excited!
