A candid revelation by Nigerian media host Morayo Afolabi-Brown has brought to light a rarely discussed, yet seemingly common, piece of advice many Nigerian parents impart to their children before they travel to the United States: a cautionary instruction to avoid African Americans and instead \u201cstay with the white people.\u201d Afolabi-Brown shared this \u201cpep talk\u201don an episodeof her TVC program,Your View,exposing a generational fear rooted in stereotypes that creates a wedge between African immigrants and Black Americans. She described this widespread counsel as being driven by fear and preconceived notions, noting how it inadvertently fosters judgment and distance. This advice, she highlighted, persists despite the profound historical sacrifices made by Black Americans that fundamentally paved the way for African immigrants and their descendants toachieve success andopportunity abroad. While perhaps intended as a form of protection, the sentiment inadvertently reinforcesharmful divideswithin the broader Black diaspora. \u201cI can\u2019t categorically say every Nigerian got this talk, but\u2013-a lot of Nigerians who travel abroad\u2013-got this talk from their families,\u201d Afolabi-Brown began. \u201cWhere they would sit you down and tell you, \u2018You\u2019re going over there.\u2019\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t go talking to those Black Americans, oh..You can get pregnant. You can get into drugs\u2026They give you that talk, \u2018Just go to the white community and find a nice place.\u2019 So when you enter America, you already have a perception of African Americans. You judge them, and of course, they can see that judgment. And they see how you, \u2018Yes Massa,\u2019 to the oyinbos (whites).\u201d The savvy media personality candidly expressed how she could see why Black Americans were defensive when it came to Nigerians openly shunning them. Afolabi-Brown also acknowledged that immigrants benefited from Black American labor and struggle. A post shared by Onsite! AFRICA (@its_onsiteafrica) It\u2019s Onsite Africa\u2019s Instagram page, where the video was posted, and the comments section went up for the difficult open admission. \u201cIt\u2019s always been fascinating to watch Africans, specifically Nigerians, cosplay Black Americaness when it\u2019s convenient for them,\u201d one person wrote. Social media personality King Keraun chimed in, \u201cWe lowkey knew this.\u201d A Nigerian in the comments section seconded Afolabi-Brown\u2019s charge. \u201cI have to admit I\u2019m \ud83c\uddf3\ud83c\uddec and got that same pep talk. Guess who got humbled real quick by them white people in nursing school? Me, they saw me as a threat and hated my soul, so yeah, racism still exists. While I\u2019m proud to be a Nigerian, I got to tip my hats off to the black Americans that sacrificed their lives just for all of us colored people to be in this country. I learned my lesson the hard way.\u201d \u201cFrom the way we are treated, we already knew about \u2018the talk\u2019\u201d. \ud83d\ude02\u201d The phenomenon Afolabi-Brown described illustrates a complex interplay of identity, perception, and historicalunderstandingamong different Black communities in the United States. Many African immigrants arrive with a distinct cultural background, sometimes carrying stereotypes about Black Americans absorbed from various sources, including media and anecdotal tales. Conversely, Black Americans, having endured centuries of systemic racism and struggle,often view such aseparation as a betrayal of shared racial identity and a dismissal of the sacrifices made to create a more equitable society. Afolabi-Brown\u2019s willingness to address this sensitive topic publicly is a vital opening for introspection and dialogue. It highlights the pressing need to dismantle internal biases within the global Black community, encouraging understanding and genuine solidarity over outdated divisions. Afolabi-Brown, born in Nigeriaand educatedin the United States, is a communications executive and television personality with a media career spanning 17 years. She has worked with notable media organizations, including CMC Connect, Cue Media, and HiTV, and currently serves as the Chief Media Consultant of Kabiti Media House Limited. Her first book,Becoming the Queen of Talk TV, further solidifies her voice in the media landscape. The conversation invites both African immigrants and Black Americans to acknowledge their interconnected histories and shared struggles, ultimately fostering unity rather than allowing systemic prejudice to exploit existing rifts.
