The 47th Administration Our Lawsuits Executive Orders Budget Bill Attacks on Agencies **Congress\u2019s Big, Bad Budget Bill is a Dream for Polluters and Billionaires** Together, we can fight back to protect our families. ByEarthjustice/Policy and Legislation Team **What you should know** Congressional Republicans are using a process calledbudget reconciliationto ram through more of the Trump administration\u2019s agenda. Budget reconciliation is a tool that Congress can use to fast-track federal bills related to spending. It requires a simple majority vote in both Houses of Congress, meaning that Republicans do not need a single Democratic vote to pass the bill into law. This time, Republicans have drafted a bill that sells our public lands and oceans to the lowest bidder, exploits our natural resources, and cuts environmental justice funding and clean energy tax credits to pay for handouts to polluting industries and tax breaks for billionaires. What you can do:Ask your elected officials to side with the American people over billionaires and polluting industries. We need members of Congress to actively and publicly oppose the reconciliation bill. We cannot accept the ways it would increase energy prices, sacrifice our public lands and oceans, allow polluting industries to evade accountability in the courts, and cut critical investments in public health and environmental programs.

(Francis Chung / POLITICO via AP Images) **What is budget reconciliation?** In a nutshell, the law affords Congress a process calledbudget reconciliationto fast-track federal spending and saving changes. Reconciliation is how Congress passed the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, a $369 billion climate solutions package that made America a leader in clean energy technology. The Inflation Reduction Act also provided tax breaks for middle-class and low-income households that made home energy improvements. Federal budget proposals typically need 60 votes in the Senate, which means that either party needs support from the other to pass their budget package. But budget reconciliation only requires a simple majority, or 51 votes \u2014 and Republicans control 53 Senate seats. Instead of using their power to address real issues, they\u2019re trying to undo the progress made under the Inflation Reduction Act. They\u2019re also pushing through a free pass for billionaire polluters to harm the environment and the American people without consequences. A fossil fuel drilling site on Alaska\u2019s North Slope. (Marc Morrison / Cavan Images / Getty Images) **This bill will harm our families, our public lands and oceans, and our planet** Republicans have run roughshod over budget reconciliation guidelines: they\u2019re including substantive policy changes in a process that is strictly intended for federal fiscal policy. Among Republicans\u2019 \u201cbudget\u201d priorities for the 2025 reconciliation process: Mandating offshore oil-and-gas drilling, including in sensitive ocean ecosystems and endangered species habitat like the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska\u2019s Arctic Requiring federal agencies to open additional hundreds of thousands of acres to oil, gas, and coal leasing, as well as logging and mining Removing checks and balances that have helped us protect public lands for generations by prohibitinganyonefrom challenging wealthy polluters in court. Instead, big polluters will simply be able to pay their way out of being held accountable for damaging OUR public lands. Cutting popular, job-creating clean energy tax credits, funding for environmental justice programs, and grants that allow coastal communities to build resilience against natural disasters Iron workers construct the framework for a 4.7 million-square-foot Panasonic EV battery plant near DeSoto, Kansas in 2023. Panasonic could earn as much as $6.8 billion in federal tax incentives from the Inflation Reduction Act for the facility, which is expected to be the largest battery factory in the world. (Charlie Riedel / AP) **Less money for local jobs and community investments\u2026** Once again, Trump and his congressional enablers aren\u2019t shy about targeting programs that have been good for Americans of all political stripes. By repealing the Inflation Reduction Act\u2019s environmental justice investments and clean energy tax credits,members of Congress would take away hundreds of billions of dollars in investments from their communities. Their own districts and states would lose hundreds of thousands of jobs, and hardworking people would pay more for energy bills and environmental harm. The Inflation Reduction Act is a proven, bipartisan winner that hasalready created over 400,000 jobsacross 48 states and Puerto Rico. It\u2019shelped clean energy jobs to grow at double the rate of overall job growthnationwide. All told, the Inflation Reduction Act is expected to have over $3.8 trillion in economic benefits while providing Americans with affordable, reliable clean energy \u2014 if Republicans don\u2019t gut it first.

(Marc Morrison / Cavan Images / Getty Images) **\u2026even MORE handouts for polluting industries\u2026** Congressional Republicans will take a wrecking ball to green jobs, clean energy, and social safety nets like Medicaid, while finding plenty of funds to provide tax windfalls to billionaires and sweetheart deals to industries that pollute our lands, our waters, and our bodies. They\u2019re hungry to expand drilling ineveryregion of the country, onshore and offshore, by using budget reconciliation to mandate auctions of public lands and waters in the Gulf of Mexico, the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, Alaska\u2019s Cook Inlet, vast habitats in Western states, and much, much more. They\u2019re prioritizing this giveaway even though record production levels have alreadypushed the limits of how fast companies can drill. For once, oil and gas executives are the ones saying \u201cenough\u201d \u2014 they already have excessive leases on our public lands. In the Gulf of Mexico, oil and gas corporations are producing on just 20% of the 12 million acres they lease offshore; in Alaska, none of them showed up to bid on ANWR leases offered by the Biden administration in January 2025. **\u2026.and even MORE destructive powers to the Trump administration.** This bill isn\u2019t just about billionaires and polluters; it transfers an inordinate amount of power to the Trump administration, insulating its actions from the courts and giving it power to target anyone who disagrees. Remember the part about giving wealthy polluters a free pass from their day in court? Buried in the legislative text are provisions that would create a \u201cpay-to-pollute\u201d scheme where sponsors of major dirty projects can pay a fee for an expedited environmental review that\u2019s shielded from court scrutiny. These provisions would give the Trump administration authority to ram through polluting projects while tying the hands of everyday people and communities who would otherwise challenge the impacts to their health, our ecosystems, and our planet.

(Michael Swensen for Earthjustice) **Tell Congress to fight for you, not polluters** As energy, health care, and food costs rise for people across the country, House and Senate Republicans have responded by asking people to do more with less. Meanwhile, they\u2019re doubling down on providing massive handouts and tax breaks to polluting industries, huge corporations, and the nation\u2019s wealthiest people. If passed, this plan would sacrifice your public lands and take more from your family\u2019s wallet to line the pockets of billionaires and polluters. Of course, the Trump administration won\u2019t stop here. They\u2019ll continue shredding our social safety nets. The \u201csavings\u201d won\u2019t reach you or me; that money gets funneled back to people who\u2019ve always been able to afford their groceries and medications \u2014 people who\u2019ve never worried about whether their water is safe to drink, or if their air is bad for their lungs. Members of Congress need to hear that Americans are watching the federal budget process to see who fights for the public good. Earthjustice strongly opposes budget reconciliation provisions that include any of the following: Opening the Arctic and other cherished public lands and ocean to oil and gas drilling, coal leasing, mining, and logging Creating loopholes that allow polluters to \u201cpay to pollute\u201d and evade accountability by circumventing bedrock environmental laws, like the National Environmental Policy Act and Endangered Species Act Defunding Inflation Reduction Act grants that are actively lowering energy costs and cleaning up pollution in communities heavily burdened by environmental injustices and climate change Effectively repealing the Inflation Reduction Act\u2019s clean energy tax credits even though they\u2019re driving hundreds of billions of dollars in investment and hundreds of thousands of jobs into communities across the country Building the border wall through sensitive habitats and communities between the U.S. and Mexico Attacking environmental health and Medicaid Tell your congressional representatives that it\u2019s time to stand up for the people who elected them by protecting our health, our public lands, and our social safety nets.
