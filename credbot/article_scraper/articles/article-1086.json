Club Jezebel Splinter Music Movies TV Comedy Games Books Food Drink Travel Tech Video Newsletter Instagram YouTube Twitter Facebook TikTok **Willem Dafoe Lurks Around Another Man\u2019s Home in First Trailer for Hulu\u2019sThe Man in My Basement** Copy Link Facebook X Reddit Email There\u2019s nothing quite like a creepy basement, especially when that basement contains Willem Dafoe as a seemingly nefarious, perhaps unhinged character who\u2019s insisted on haggling his way into someone else\u2019s home. The first teaser for Hulu\u2019s upcoming feature filmThe Man in My Basementpromises exactly that, along with some extra layers of eeriness. For example, a girl standing in the woods wears a particularly off-putting dog mask and the down-on-his-luck protagonist\u2014played by Corey Hawkins, who you may know fromThe Walking Dead\u2014is seen digging outside in the dead of night \u2026 searching for something? Hiding something? Nothing suspicious to see here. Exclusive Excerpt: A Young Weaver Struggles to Make Ends Meet inBeguiled NopeIs American Mythmaking Done Right NBC\u2019sGrand CrewIs the Sunny Hangout Comedy You Need in Your Life Based on the novel by Walter Mosley,The Man in My Basementis directed by Nadia Latif\u2014her first time directing a feature film\u2014with a screenplay by Mosley and Latif. The teaser suggests a psychological thriller with maybe a few more intellectual leanings in the vein of Jordan Peele\u2019sGet Out(2017).For Dafoe,The Man in My Basementmight fit comfortably next to a few other roles in films that play around in the world of high-minded eeriness, such asNosferatu(2024) orPoor Things(2023). There\u2019s certainly been a recent harkening for thrillers that aim a bit higher with their scares and frightening atmospheres, and although it doesn\u2019t get much more old school than masks, ancestral homes, and grimy basements sure to be hiding even grimier secrets, one can hope thatThe Man in My Basementhas a new twist in store to shake up a well-trodden formula. In addition to Hawkins and Dafoe, Anna Diop and Tamara Lawrence are also set to star. At the very least, the film should benefit from such a consummate professional as Willem Dafoe in its lead (antagonist?) role. The Man in My Basementis set to be released on Hulu and in select theaters on a date yet to be announced.
