The new system \u201cwill be capable of intercepting missiles even if they are launched from other sides of the world and even if they are launched from space,\u201d Trump announced May 20 at a White House press conference. Gen. Michael Guetlein, the vice chief of operations at the U.S. Space Force, will lead the Golden Dome program, Trump said. His comments focused primarily on a system of space-based interceptors for boost-phase intercept of adversary missiles, which Trump says will cost $175 billion and three years to complete. But in a separate statement issued by the Defense Department following the press conference, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said the Golden Dome will be a \u201csystem of systems\u201d that \u201cis designed to leverage some past investments.\u201d \u201cAll of the systems comprising the Golden Dome architecture will need to be seamlessly integrated,\u201d Hegseth said. It \u201cwill be fielded in phases, prioritizing defense where the threat is greatest.\u201d Andrea Yaffe, the acting principal deputy assistant secretary of defense for space policy, told senators May 13 that the department has developed several missile defense architecture options, which were then presented by Hegseth to Trump. Yaffe spoke in response to questioning by Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.) in a hearing before the Strategic Forces subcommittee of the Senate Armed Services Committee. Although that key subcommittee is split over the merits of the president\u2019s missile defense plan, senators acknowledged that a full assessment of the architecture would require more detail when the full defense budget arrives. The \u201ceconomics don\u2019t work,\u201d said Sen. Angus King (I-Maine), the subcommittee\u2019s ranking member, pressing Yaffe and other officials to explain how a missile defense shield could defend against a Chinese or Russian strike involving hundreds or thousands of missiles. At the request of the subcommittee, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) published estimates May 5 indicating that a system of space-based interceptors would cost between $161 billion and $542 billion over 20 years, depending on requirements and design decisions. The CBO cautioned, however, that these estimates were derived from plans originally formulated to address the threat of \u201cone or two [intercontinental ballistic missiles] ICBMs fired by North Korea.\u201d Asked May 15 about the upper estimate of $542 billion at the POLITICO 2025 Security Summit, Gen. B. Chance Saltzman, the chief of space operations, said, \u201cI\u2019ve never seen an early estimate that was too high.\u201d In their May 8 statement, Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin characterized the Golden Dome project as a rejection of the \u201cinseparable interrelationship between strategic offensive arms and strategic defensive arms, which is one of the central and fundamental principles of maintaining global strategic stability.\u201d The statement was issued during a visit by Xi to Moscow to attend commemorations of the 80th anniversary of the end of the Second World War in Europe and the founding of the United Nations. In past joint statements, the two countries have expressed brief concerns about U.S. missile defense plans. For example, in a June 2019 statement on strengthening contemporary global strategic stability, the two sides said that U.S. missile defense plans would have an \u201cextremely negative effect on international and regional strategic balance, security and stability.\u201d But the new statement from May 2025 is more specific and much lengthier, outlining concerns that the United States is developing the capability to use \u201chigh-precision conventional weapons or a combination of nuclear and non-nuclear weapon systems\u201d to launch a strike against the strategic nuclear forces of Beijing or Moscow. Golden Dome would then, in this hypothetical scenario, intercept a \u201cradically weakened retaliatory strike with air and missile defense assets.\u201d The aspiration of the United States to \u201censure an overwhelming military superiority \u2026 fundamentally contradicts the logic underlying the maintenance of strategic balance,\u201d the joint statement claims. Although China and Russia have missile defense capabilities, neither country has articulated plans for large-scale homeland strategic missile defense. China has tested its Chinese Dongneng-3 interceptor against an intermediate-range target, while Russia maintains a local missile defense system around Moscow that can intercept a limited number of intercontinental ballistic missiles. The most advanced Russian mobile air and missile defense system, the S-500, is designed to intercept intermediate-range ballistic missiles. As an Atlantic Council report in February noted, Russian missile defense investments are focused on \u201cprotecting Russian leadership, critical command and control, and nuclear forces.\u201d **Footer Top** Resources Donate About Contact Us Email Updates **Join the Arms Control Association** The Arms Control Association depends on the generous contributions of individuals who share our goal of promoting public understanding of and support for effective arms control policies.
