Krone asked the board to delay the vote to certify and add the various spellings of his name in the Democratic primary for Freeland Council. Election board Solicitor Gene Molino said the board couldn\u2019t delay the certification vote and couldn\u2019t add the various spelling under state law. Molino told Krone he had to file a court petition to add the various spellings. Krone was on the Republican ballot for Freeland Council and failed to win a nomination by finishing fourth. The top three candidates won Republican nominations. According to the election results posted on the county website, 5 write-in votes were for \u201cMathew Krone,\u201d 6 were for \u201cMatthew Krone,\u201d and 5 were for \u201cMatt Krone.\u201d Krone said he needs 10 write-in votes to secure a Democratic nomination and appear on the November general election ballot. Only one Democrat was on the primary ballot for Freeland Council. Also at Monday\u2019s meeting, Controller Walter Griffith asked the election bureau if they could post campaign finance reports on the bureau website in a more timely manner. Griffith and former boar member Audrey Serniak told the board they were impressed with the new process for adjudicating mail ballots with deficiencies and provisional ballots. The new process involves an election staff canvassing board that conducts ballot reviews to speed up the adjudication process, and the election board still voted to accept or reject ballots. A provisional ballot is issued at polling locations when there\u2019s a problem verifying the status of a registered voter or if a voter was issued an absentee or mail ballot and the ballot and outer return envelope was not surrendered at the polling place to be spoiled. **Share this:** Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Facebook Click to share on X (Opens in new window)X **RevContent Feed** **Most Popular** American Red Cross buys former Norm\u2019s Pizza property for $1.1MAmerican Red Cross buys former Norm\u2019s Pizza property for $1.1M **American Red Cross buys former Norm\u2019s Pizza property for $1.1M** **American Red Cross buys former Norm\u2019s Pizza property for $1.1M** ICE arrests 4 migrants working in ExeterICE arrests 4 migrants working in Exeter **ICE arrests 4 migrants working in Exeter** **ICE arrests 4 migrants working in Exeter** Luzerne County Sports Hall of Fame induction ceremonyLuzerne County Sports Hall of Fame induction ceremony **Luzerne County Sports Hall of Fame induction ceremony** **Luzerne County Sports Hall of Fame induction ceremony** Wyoming man charged with robbing teenWyoming man charged with robbing teen **Wyoming man charged with robbing teen** **Wyoming man charged with robbing teen** 3 teens charged in Facebook Marketplace robbery3 teens charged in Facebook Marketplace robbery **3 teens charged in Facebook Marketplace robbery** **3 teens charged in Facebook Marketplace robbery** Anti-DEI group targets Geisinger College of Health Sciences over programAnti-DEI group targets Geisinger College of Health Sciences over program **Anti-DEI group targets Geisinger College of Health Sciences over program** **Anti-DEI group targets Geisinger College of Health Sciences over program** Luzerne County Court NotesLuzerne County Court Notes **Luzerne County Court Notes** **Luzerne County Court Notes** $20 billion Amazon data center investment in Pennsylvania includes one in Salem Twp.$20 billion Amazon data center investment in Pennsylvania includes one in Salem Twp. **$20 billion Amazon data center investment in Pennsylvania includes one in Salem Twp.** **$20 billion Amazon data center investment in Pennsylvania includes one in Salem Twp.** Region mourns death of local legend Ace BrognaRegion mourns death of local legend Ace Brogna **Region mourns death of local legend Ace Brogna** **Region mourns death of local legend Ace Brogna** Police: Alleged killer\u2019s cellphone pinged at crime scenePolice: Alleged killer\u2019s cellphone pinged at crime scene **Police: Alleged killer\u2019s cellphone pinged at crime scene** **Police: Alleged killer\u2019s cellphone pinged at crime scene** **More in Local News** Authority negotiating sale of land for new hotel **Authority negotiating sale of land for new hotel** **Authority negotiating sale of land for new hotel** Land bank OKs sale of Downtown Wilkes-Barre lot for educational garden **Land bank OKs sale of Downtown Wilkes-Barre lot for educational garden** **Land bank OKs sale of Downtown Wilkes-Barre lot for educational garden** King\u2019s College to launch new campus projects **King\u2019s College to launch new campus projects** **King\u2019s College to launch new campus projects** County council holds off expanding tax breaks for vets **County council holds off expanding tax breaks for vets** **County council holds off expanding tax breaks for vets** 2025 June 9 Site LinksSubscribeNewsletters and AlertsArchivesSubmission Forms Subscribe Newsletters and Alerts Archives Submission Forms Subscribe Newsletters and Alerts Archives Submission Forms Our CompaniesThe Times-TribuneStandard-SpeakerRepublican HeraldAccess NEPA.comGreater Pittston ProgressWyoming County Examiner The Times-Tribune Standard-Speaker Republican Herald Access NEPA.com Greater Pittston Progress Wyoming County Examiner The Times-Tribune Standard-Speaker Republican Herald Access NEPA.com Greater Pittston Progress Wyoming County Examiner citizensvoice.com75 N.
