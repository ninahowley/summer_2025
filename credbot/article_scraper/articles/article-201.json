And what better way to do that than with food? Patricia Bannan, Registered Dietitian and Author of From Burnout to Balance, joins our Laura Cavanaugh with some tasty summertime recipes packed with superfoods to help Dad, and the special men in our lives, feel their best. We know Dads love pistachios. Whether Dad loves the In-Shell or No Shell, he\u2019ll love the bold flavor options from Wonderful Pistachios, like Smoky Barbecue, Sea Salt & Vinegar, Chilli Roasted and their newest flavor Dill Pickle. Pistachios offer 6 grams of complete proteinand3 grams of fiber per serving, making them a smart snack with staying power.

Whether Dad\u2019s a meat lover or not, Bannan says he\u2019ll love Heart Healthy Chorizo Spiced Lentil and Avocado Tacos. They\u2019re full of plant-based goodness\u2014featuring lentils and walnuts for protein and fiber, plus avocados two ways: in a citrus-forward crema and avocado slices on top. Avocados are virtually the only fruit that provides heart-healthy monounsaturated fats, which may help lower bad (LDL) cholesterol while supporting good (HDL) levels. A recent study in the Journal of the American Heart Association found that adults with larger waistlines who ate one avocado daily improved their diet quality, sleep and LDL cholesterol levels You can get this recipe atwww.LoveOneToday.com. For fun drinks to pair with your meal, raise a glass to Dad with a refreshing Pomegranate Ginger Mojito Mocktail. Bannan combined POM Wonderful juice with ginger beer, fresh lime and mint leaves for a bright, tangy twist. If you want to give it a little kick, just add a splash of rum. POM Wonderful 100% Pomegranate Juice is a tasty way to fuel your body with antioxidants. Each 8-ounce bottle contains the juice of two whole pomegranates and nothing else\u2014no added sugar, fillers, or preservatives.
