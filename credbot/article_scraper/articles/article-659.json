The bill\u2019s cuts pose significant threats to critical programs that disproportionately serve LGBTQ+ individuals and families, particularly those who are low-income, living with HIV, or facing food insecurity. Should the bill be signed into law, it would be thelargest transferof wealth from poor and working class Americans to the extremely wealthy in the nation\u2019s history. In addition, late last night, House Republicans changed a previous anti-trans provision so it now cuts off federal Medicaid and Affordable Care Act funding for medically-necessary care for ALL transgender people\u2013no matter their age. People in this country want policies and solutions that make life better and expand access to the American Dream. Instead, anti-equality lawmakers voted to give handouts to billionaires built on the backs of hardworking people \u2013 with devastating consequences for the LGBTQ+ community. If the cuts to programs like Medicaid and SNAP or resources like Planned Parenthood clinics weren\u2019t devastating enough, House Republicans added a last minute provision that expands its attacks on access to best practice health care to transgender adults. This cruel addition shows their priorities have never been about lowering costs or expanding health care access\u2013but in targeting people simply for who they are. These lawmakers have abandoned their constituents, and as they head back to their districts, know this: they will hear from us. In the coming days, HRC will mobilize supporters and concerned constituents in key Congressional districts to meet with their lawmakers and demand accountability for these devastating cuts. Key Background on Impact of GOP Reconciliation Bills to LGBTQ+ People Estimates from the Congressional Budget Office find that the Republican proposals could kick 13.7 million people off of Medicaid. Medicaid is a crucial source of health care for LGBTQ+ individuals, covering a disproportionate share of low-income LGBTQ+ people, including 21% of transgender individuals and 40% of people living with HIVMedicaid is the largest payer for HIV care in the U.S., and any cuts would jeopardize access to essential treatment for individuals living with HIV, undermining national efforts to end the epidemicMany LGBTQ+ community health centers rely on federal funding through Medicaid; any reduction would limit services like mental health support, gender-affirming care, and STI testingRoughly 22-25% of LGBTQ+ adults in the US live in poverty, compared to about 16% of nontransgender, straight adults Medicaid is the largest payer for HIV care in the U.S., and any cuts would jeopardize access to essential treatment for individuals living with HIV, undermining national efforts to end the epidemic Many LGBTQ+ community health centers rely on federal funding through Medicaid; any reduction would limit services like mental health support, gender-affirming care, and STI testing Roughly 22-25% of LGBTQ+ adults in the US live in poverty, compared to about 16% of nontransgender, straight adults Medicaid is the largest payer for HIV care in the U.S., and any cuts would jeopardize access to essential treatment for individuals living with HIV, undermining national efforts to end the epidemic Many LGBTQ+ community health centers rely on federal funding through Medicaid; any reduction would limit services like mental health support, gender-affirming care, and STI testing Roughly 22-25% of LGBTQ+ adults in the US live in poverty, compared to about 16% of nontransgender, straight adults NEW: The bill forbids the use of federal Medicaid and CHIP funding for medically-necessary health care for transgender people of ALL agesA second provision would prevent states from offering medically necessary health care to all transgender people through ACA health plans by excluding this care from the definition of \"essential health benefits,\" regardless of age.
