That\u2019s a huge break from its regular price of $599. **15 Million+ Subscribers** For Babbel to reach this enormous number of customers, they must be doing a lot of things right even beyond having a wide range of international languages available to learn. Babbel\u2019s wide-ranging appeal comes in part from how the lessons are structured, Instead of lengthy, tiring sessions, Babbel\u2019s lessons are broken down in to increments of 10 to 15 minutes, and rather than getting lost in the minutiae of sentence diagramming, arcane grammar, and other deep-dive teaching, Babbel concentrates on practical vocabulary and sentences you would use in real-life situations. Babbel\u2019s goal is not only to teach you a new language, but also to teach it so you sound as close to native as possible.It skips the stilted sentences that many other language teaching formats use in favor of more colloquial speaking, and Babbel also had advanced speech-recognition technology to help you with your pronunciation. **Worldwide Languages** Babbel offers courses in Spanish, German, Italian, French, Portuguese, Swedish, Turkish, Dutch, Polish, Indonesian, Norwegian, Danish, Russian, and English, and all are covered by this lifetime subscription deal for just $130.
