Quiogue was spotted by police with the device and arrested, but not before throwing the device while attempting to flee, McEvoy said. Quiogue was ordered to remain detained after his initial court appearance Tuesday, while Galvez was expected to make his first court appearance in the coming days. In Orange County, Christian Andres Garcia, 32, of Anaheim and Rene Luna, 43, of Orange each face a charge of misdemeanor assault on a federal officer stemming from aMonday protest in Santa Ana. Both men face up to one year in federal prison if convicted, McEvoy said.
