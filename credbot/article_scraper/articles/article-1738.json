They claim the world that exists today was sculpted by natural processes over billions of years. However, this interpretation presents many issues both scientifically and theologically. Contrary to popular belief, the global evidence indicates a recent catastrophic past. Earth Systems: An Introduction to Earth System Origins, Structures, and Processesequips students with a biblical understanding of Earth science. The three authors include experienced researchers and professors who have deeply studied geology, meteorology, oceanography, climatology, and more. Filled with practical information and colorful visuals, this undergraduate-level textbook is designed to reinforce a Christian worldview in the classroom and beyond. This book is available as a digital downloadhere. Tags: Thomas Breuner, Timothy Clarey, and Jake Hebert, 2153 Bought with the intention of deciding if an appropriate textbook for home schooled high school age grandchildren. It is, but better used as a read & discuss together textbook. Chapter 2 on plate tectonics is thorough and outstanding! It fully validates my belief in Catastrophic Plate Tectonics, which I have held since a 1972 public college geography class, but never had all the proof in front of me until now.
