Republican leadership on the Wisconsin Joint Committee on Finance has said it will not support any attempt to replace those reductions in federal spending with state tax dollars. But so far \u2014 unlike what has happened in Indiana \u2014 there is no talk of cutting millions in existing state government funding that flows to the same entities. The Indiana General Assembly \u2014 an outlier so far \u2014 preceded Trump\u2019s executive order last month when it removed all state funding for public broadcasting in the state\u2019s two-year budget. In Wisconsin, in addition to federal funding, at least another $8.6 million on average in annual state appropriations flow to Wisconsin Public Media \u2014 a division of the University of Wisconsin-Madison that operates Wisconsin Public Radio and PBS Wisconsin, according to WPM financial documentation. That total does not include any state tax dollars that might flow directly to entities under WPM control or state money that might flow to other public radio and broadcast stations that are not under the WPM umbrella. Wisconsin Public Mediadoes not operate Milwaukee PBS or WUWM, the National Public Radio affiliate in Milwaukee. While the Joint Committee on Finance is in a holding pattern until the impact of the federal cuts becomes clearer, committee member Rep. Alex Dallman told the Badger Institute that state tax dollars won\u2019t be filling any revenue gaps for public broadcasting in the state. Dallman (R-Markesan) said Republicans in the Legislature believe the president is correct to call out the bias in WPR and PBS Wisconsin news coverage. Those Republicans, however, have been frustrated by an inability to spur reform in any area of the UW System due to a budget process that gives lawmakers no line-item control over budgeting for entities like public broadcasting. \u201cEven if we wanted to cut state funding for public broadcasting, we\u2019ve found on other issues that the UW System just moves money around to cover for it. They find the money, so it\u2019s a roundabout,\u201d Dallman said. \u201cI will say we won\u2019t be adding any funding to make up for these federal cuts.\u201d While Wisconsin Public Media does not publish an annual revenue total for all TV and radio affiliates in the state, that figure was at least $60 million in 2024. Somewhere between $24 million and $27 million \u2014 that is, 40 to 45 percent of that revenue \u2014 comes from donors and members. Federal and state tax dollars are another large source of revenue. Last year, fiscal 2024, the federal Corporation for Public Broadcasting made 16 grants totaling $8,498,812 to PBS Wisconsin, WPR and affiliates, according to a Badger Institute review of CPB records and the required financial statements made to CPB by the Wisconsin affiliates. In 2024, WHA in Madison, the hub of WPR and PBS Wisconsin, got federal CPB grants totaling $2,760,053, 13.2 percent of its $20.9 million of total revenue, according to its CPB filing. Milwaukee PBS, which is not part of PBS Wisconsin andis owned by the Milwaukee Area Technical Collegeinstead of the UW system, got grants totaling $2,057,510, or just under 14 percent of its total revenue for 2024. Some smaller, rural Wisconsin Public Radio affiliates in a network of 39 stations \u2014 18 news and 21 music \u2014 are more heavily dependent on federal funding. WXPR in Rhinelander, for example, got nearly 20 percent of its revenue \u2014 $155,076 of $837,063 \u2014 from the CPB, according to its filing. By contrast, WUWM in Milwaukee, which isnot part of Wisconsin Public Radio, got just 6.2 percent, or $299,874, of its $4,809,467 revenue total from the CPB, according to its filing. Dallman criticized WPR and PBS Wisconsin forposting a warningthat the federal cuts could endanger the state\u2019s emergency alert system, which is part of the larger public communications system. \u201cOur focus is on the programming and what\u2019s coming out of UW,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no willingness to go after the Communications Board or the infrastructure, towers and systems that are in place.\u201d There will, however, be funding questions raised in the response to the federal cuts by WPR and PBS Wisconsin. Layoffs at WPR are expected sometime in June, but the scope of them isn\u2019t clear, according tostatementsmade by Wisconsin Public Media officials to the Capital Times this week. \u201cNow \u2026 we\u2019re in a position to confirm that WPR will need to make staff reductions as we work toward a balanced budget,\u201d WPR officials wrote in a staff-wide email that went out in March, the Capital Times reported. Trump\u2019sorder\u201cending taxpayer subsidization of biased media\u201d comes at a time when the Public Broadcasting Service and National Public Radio are bleeding viewers and listeners in Wisconsin and across the country. Layoffs and corporate restructuring at WPR were in the works months before Trump announced he was putting an end to more than $1 billion in grants paid through the CPB. Membership, donor, viewer and listener declines are outlined in the Communications Board\u2019s budget request made months before the executive order. The number of weekly WPR listeners fell by more than 20 percent to 339,500 in 2024, or 86,700 fewer than the 426,200 in 2019, according to the budget document. And while WPR member revenue was up 18 percent during the same period, to $10.9 million in 2024, the board anticipates a drop of more than $1 million, or almost 10 percent, this year, the document says. The falloff in NPR listeners nationally has been going on for more than five years. A Pew Research Centerstudyof its 20 top stations showed a drop of eight million listeners in a single year, from 2021 to 2022. Radio Research Consortium\u2019sanalysisof 46 public news radio stations last year found a decrease in listeners of 24 percent. In Indiana, the decision to cut all state funding for public broadcasting decreased revenue for the state\u2019s network of 17 public television and radio stations by $3.67 million over two years, Mark Newman, executive director of the Indiana Public Broadcasting Service,told WFYI this week.
