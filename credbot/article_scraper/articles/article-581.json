Blotch News Metro **Minority Group Files Lawsuit Against Tarrant County, Alleging Racially Gerrymandered Voting Map** The minority voters are represented by a powerful voting rights attorney. The litigation will not be cheap, and local taxpayers will foot the bill. tweet After County Judge Tim O\u2019Hare and his fellow Republican commissioners recently approved a new voting map that neuters the voices of local Blacks and Latinos, a group of minority voters filed a federal lawsuit accusing the commissioners of racial gerrymandering, violating the 1965 Voting Rights Act and the Constitution. The GOP commissioners say they are acting in a partisan nature, which is constitutional, as opposed to racial, which is not. Their goal is to flip a Democratic seat to Republican. Their rationale is that Republican leadership is responsible for Tarrant County\u2019s popularity and prosperity, not Democratic rule, even though annual wages and job growth are better in Democrat-run Texas counties like Dallas, Harris (Houston), and Travis (Austin) than in Tarrant. An analysis by the UCLA Voting Rights Project reveals the racial bias in the new map, proving \u201ca consistent pattern of racial packing\u201d that silences the voices of Blacks and Latinos, who make up a majority of Tarrant County\u2019s population. The plaintiffs have added that during his 2022 campaign, O\u2019Hare said: \u201cIf you\u2019re a Republican officeholder and you haven\u2019t been called a racist, then you probably haven\u2019t done a thing\u201d Tarrant County taxpayers will pay for the commissioners\u2019 defense. The legal challenge will not be cheap. The plaintiffs are represented by powerful Texas-based voting rights attorney Chad Dunn. \u201cIntentional discrimination is still against the law,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cThe map they drew, the process they used to draw it, and the animosity shown to the citizens of Tarrant County violate the Voting Rights Act and the Constitution.\u201d The map was drawn by a national GOP operative and a prominent anti-voting law firm in Washington, D.C.
