David Allvin, the US Air Force chief of staff, said at a defense conference in Washington on Tuesday, adding that the US is vulnerable to similar attacks. \u201cThere is no sanctuary even in the US homeland \u2013 particularly given that our bases back home are essentially completely unhardened,\u201d Thomas Shugart, an adjunct senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security (CNAS), told CNN. By \u201cunhardened,\u201d Shugart means there aren\u2019t enough shelters in which US warplanes can be parked that are tough enough to protect them from airstrikes, be it from drones or missiles. Related articleUkraine\u2019s drone attack the latest in a series of daring David versus Goliath hits against Russian targets Related articleUkraine\u2019s drone attack the latest in a series of daring David versus Goliath hits against Russian targets Ukrainian military officials said 41 Russian aircraft were hit in last Sunday\u2019s attacks, including strategic bombers and surveillance planes, with some destroyed and others damaged. Later analysis shows at least 12 planes destroyed or damaged, and reviews of satellite imagery were continuing. The Ukrainian operation used drones smuggled into Russian territory, hidden in wooden mobile houses atop trucks and driven close to four Russian air bases, according to Ukrainian sources. Once near the bases, the roofs of the mobile houses were remotely opened, and the drones deployed to launch their strikes. The Russian planes were sitting uncovered on the tarmac at the bases, much as US warplanes are at facilities at home and abroad. \u201cWe are pretty vulnerable,\u201d retired US Army Gen. Stanley McChrystal told CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper on Tuesday. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of high-value assets that are extraordinarily expensive,\u201d McChrystal said. The Ukrainians said their attacks destroyed $7 billion worth of Russian aircraft. By comparison, a single US Air Force B-2 bomber costs $2 billion. And the US has only 20 of them. Shugart co-authoreda report for the Hudson Institutein January highlighting the threat to US military installations from China in the event of any conflict between the superpowers. \u201cPeople\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) strike forces of aircraft, ground-based missile launchers, surface and subsurface vessels, and special forces can attack US aircraft and their supporting systems at airfields globally, including in the continental United States,\u201d Shugart and fellow author Timothy Walton wrote. War game simulations and analyses show \u201cthe overwhelming majority of US aircraft losses would likely occur on the ground at airfields (and that the losses could be ruinous),\u201d Shugart and Walton wrote. A report from Air and Space Forces magazine last year pointed out that Anderson Air Force Base on the Pacific island of Guam \u2013 perhaps the US\u2019 most important air facility in the Pacific \u2013 which has hosted rotations of those $2 billion B-2 bombers, as well as B-1 and B-52 bombers, has no hardened shelters. Allvin, the USAF chief of staff, admitted the problem on Tuesday. \u201cRight now, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s where we need to be,\u201d Allvin told a conference of the CNAS. McChrystal said the US must look at how to protect its bases and the aircraft on them but also how it monitors the areas around those facilities. \u201cIt widens the spectrum of the threats you\u2019ve got to deal with,\u201d McChrystal said. **The cost of \u2018playing defense\u2019** But all that costs money, and Allvin said that presents the US with a budget dilemma. Does it spend defense dollars on hardened shelters and ways to stop drones and missiles from attacking US bases, or does it use more resources on offensive weapons that take the fight to the enemy?

But even a mini version in the Pacific is taking a while \u201cIf all we are doing is playing defense and can\u2019t shoot back, then that\u2019s not a good use of our money,\u201d Allvin told the CNAS conference. \u201cWe\u2019ve always known that hardening our bases is something we needed to do,\u201d Allvin said, but other items have been given budget priority. Hardened aircraft shelters aren\u2019t flashy and are unlikely to generate the headlines of other defense projects, including planes like the new B-21 bombers, each of which is expected to cost around $700 million. And US President Donald Trump said recently the Air Force will build a new stealth fighter,the F-47,with an initial cost of $300 million per aircraft. \u201cThe F-47 is an amazing aircraft, but it\u2019s going to die on the ground if we don\u2019t protect it,\u201d Allvin said. Meanwhile, a hardened shelter costs around $30 million, according to Shugart and Walton. Last month Trump revealed another form of air defense for the US mainland, the Golden Dome missile shield, expected to cost at least $175 billion. Despite the huge price tag, it\u2019s designed to counter long-range threats, like intercontinental ballistic missiles fired from a different hemisphere. **Vastness as a weakness** In Russia\u2019s case, the vastness of its territory was seen as a strength in its war with Ukraine. One of the air bases hit in Ukraine\u2019s Operation \u201cSpiderweb\u201d was closer to Tokyo than Kyiv. But now Russia\u2019s size is a weakness, writes David Kirichenko onthe Ukraine Watch blogof the Atlantic Council. Every border crossing may be an infiltration point; every cargo container on every highway or rail line must be treated with suspicion. \u201cThis is a logistical nightmare,\u201d Kirichenko said. And there is a direct analogy to the United States. US Air Force bomber bases are usually well inland, but accessible to vehicles large and small. For instance, all 20 B-2 bombers are stationed at Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri. It\u2019s about 600 miles from the nearest coastline, the Gulf of Mexico, but only about 25 miles south of Interstate 70, one of the main east-west traffic arteries in the US, with thousands of commercial vehicles passing by daily. Dyess Air Force Base in Texas, one of the homes of US B-1 bombers, sits just south of another major east-west commercial artery, Interstate 20.

Meanwhile, in the Pacific, even better US offensive firepower, like Gen. Allvin would like to have, might not be enough in the event of a conflict with China. That\u2019s because the PLA has made a concerted effort to protect its aircraft during its massive military buildup under leader Xi Jinping, according to the Hudson Institute report. China has more than 650 hardened aircraft shelters at airfields within 1,150 miles of the Taiwan Strait, the report says. But Shugart and Walton argue the best move Washington could make would be to make Beijing build more \u2013 by improving US strike capabilities in Asia. \u201cIn response the\u2026 PLA would likely continue to spend funds on additional costly passive and active defense measures and in turn would have less to devote to alternative investments, including strike and other power projection capabilities,\u201d they said.
