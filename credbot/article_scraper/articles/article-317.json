She now teaches at the same school she attended when she was younger, and loves to spark questions and discussions in her lessons with her students. Douglass Middle School Principal Cristina Morel praises Prawl for being a role model not only in the classroom but also in the school, and for the genuine care she shows her students. \u201cWhitney wears many hats on our campus and means different things to different people,\u201d Morel said. \u201cShe is a key member of our Guiding Coalition, is the HSS department chair, and a WEA Rep for the site. She supports her colleagues and motivates her students to learn more and grow as individuals. She helps plan and support our academic initiatives and can be counted on to dress up for every spirit day.\u201d Morel continued: \u201cMrs. Prawl is one of those teachers who thinks everything through and puts in effort \u2013 she does not do things by halves. Her lessons are detailed and include tons of support so that every student has the opportunity to be successful in her class. She is creative and designs lessons that students enjoy. Whitney has a great balance of being fun and welcoming, but her students know that there are rules and order- and they thrive in that environment.\u201d Prawl is honored and grateful to be recognized as Teacher of the Week. \u201cI really enjoy the fact that I get to teach where I went to school. It\u2019s kind of fun,\u201d Prawl said. \u201cI work with some really great people, and I feel like so many of them could have been nominated, so I feel honored in that way, and so I\u2019m grateful, very grateful.\u201d Prawl was born and raised in Woodland. As a student, she attended Gibson Elementary, Douglas and then Woodland High School. After graduating, she attended American River College, where she studied political science and child development. She later got her degree in history with a minor in teaching education and her teaching credential at Sacramento State. Before she became a teacher, Prawl volunteered and worked in childcare programs for the Woodland and Sacramento YMCA, working with infants through high school-aged students. Through that job, she gained experience in problem-solving and working with children and parents, and she really enjoyed it. Prawl explains that she was inspired to become a teacher because she enjoyed working with kids. \u201cI think I just always really loved working with kids, and that\u2019s where I spent all my extra time,\u201d Prawl said. \u201cI knew that I wanted to do something with that as I was getting older. My aunt was also a kindergarten teacher in Woodland for decades at Gibson Elementary, and so I had a nice, positive role model in her to see that and want to be like that.\u201d At Douglass, Prawl teaches eighth-grade U.S. history, where she has been teaching since 2016. \u201cI have just always loved history,\u201d Prawl shares. \u201cWhen I first started training to be a teacher, it was not my plan to be at the middle school level. I thought I would teach elementary school for a very long time, but I\u2019ve since felt that I\u2019ve found my place working with middle school-aged kids, and I couldn\u2019t imagine teaching at a lower or higher level. I feel like I found my place.\u201d She describes her teaching style as kind and supportive, yet structured, to help her students make the classroom an inviting place and to encourage them to ask questions. \u201cMy teaching style is kind and supportive, but also to counter that, pretty firm and structured,\u201d she said. \u201cI work really hard to create an inviting classroom and a respectful environment for kids, somewhere where they could feel safe and want to take risks in asking hard questions, because that\u2019s a lot of what U.S. history does, is ask the hard questions. I\u2019m also really organized and am really good at holding kids accountable, both in their behavior and in their learning.\u201d Prawl shares that one of her and her students\u2019 favorite lessons is to work on bringing in real-time events and comparing them to past events. \u201cOne of my favorite things to work on with students is bringing in real-time events that are going on in our country and in our world, and have them analyze how they are very similar to events that are in our curriculum,\u201d she said. \u201cThe kids really find that connection in that when they see an article about something going on in our government today, and I then show them something from 200 years ago and say, \u2018Look, these are very similar,\u2019 and watch their little light bulbs go on.\u201d As the end of the school year approached, Prawl was wrapping up her unit on the Civil War. She mentioned that this is a \u201cbig theme\u201d throughout the year, as they see the shift of laws regarding enslavement. She also shares that her favorite thing about her students is that their thoughtful questions often spark meaningful discussions. \u201cI love when my students ask really thoughtful questions that kind of sparked discussions in class that lead to more organic learning when it\u2019s not just me getting notes or reading out of the textbook, but when they initiate a discussion that leads to learning happening,\u201d she said. As a former Douglass student, Prawl also enjoys sharing her memories of her time at the school. \u201cI have a lot of memories, and I can share them,\u201d Prawl said. \u201cI have no problem sharing, like, embarrassing pictures of myself, like \u2018Look guys, middle school\u2019s awkward for everybody.\u2019 But honestly, part of being at Douglass is the people that I work with. I love the staff that we have on campus and our leadership, and I feel like we are a team unlike any other. I feel like we have a really core group of great people guiding these middle schoolers through their awkward years.\u201d Additionally, Prawl is chair of the history department at Douglass, through which she helps oversee and lead the planning and organizing. She is also part of the executive board of the Woodland Education Association, where she helps guide and lead teachers in the Woodland community. Outside of teaching, Prawl enjoys exploring little bookshops with friends and getting coffee. She also enjoys spending time in her garden and exploring national parks with her husband. **Share this:** Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Facebook Click to share on X (Opens in new window)X Click to print (Opens in new window)Print **RevContent Feed** **Most Popular** Winters Police Department Chief addresses ICE raid concernsWinters Police Department Chief addresses ICE raid concerns **Winters Police Department Chief addresses ICE raid concerns** **Winters Police Department Chief addresses ICE raid concerns** City of Woodland to host 2-day Independence Day celebration July 3 and 4City of Woodland to host 2-day Independence Day celebration July 3 and 4 **City of Woodland to host 2-day Independence Day celebration July 3 and 4** **City of Woodland to host 2-day Independence Day celebration July 3 and 4** Woodland activists and residents set for \u2018No Kings March\u2019 June 14Woodland activists and residents set for 'No Kings March' June 14 **Woodland activists and residents set for \u2018No Kings March\u2019 June 14** **Woodland activists and residents set for \u2018No Kings March\u2019 June 14** Whitney Prawl\u2019s \u2018great balance of being fun and welcoming\u2019 allows students to thrive | Teacher of the WeekWhitney Prawl's 'great balance of being fun and welcoming' allows students to thrive | Teacher of the Week **Whitney Prawl\u2019s \u2018great balance of being fun and welcoming\u2019 allows students to thrive | Teacher of the Week** **Whitney Prawl\u2019s \u2018great balance of being fun and welcoming\u2019 allows students to thrive | Teacher of the Week** Summer activities heat up at Woodland LibrarySummer activities heat up at Woodland Library **Summer activities heat up at Woodland Library** **Summer activities heat up at Woodland Library** A former student opens fire at an Austrian school, killing 10 and taking his own lifeA former student opens fire at an Austrian school, killing 10 and taking his own life **A former student opens fire at an Austrian school, killing 10 and taking his own life** **A former student opens fire at an Austrian school, killing 10 and taking his own life** Student speakers at UC Davis commencements to reflect on journeysStudent speakers at UC Davis commencements to reflect on journeys **Student speakers at UC Davis commencements to reflect on journeys** **Student speakers at UC Davis commencements to reflect on journeys** Column: What is the fate of Woodland Community College?Column: What is the fate of Woodland Community College? **Column: What is the fate of Woodland Community College?** **Column: What is the fate of Woodland Community College?** **More in News** Brian Wilson, Beach Boys visionary leader and summer\u2019s poet laureate, dies at 82 **Brian Wilson, Beach Boys visionary leader and summer\u2019s poet laureate, dies at 82** **Brian Wilson, Beach Boys visionary leader and summer\u2019s poet laureate, dies at 82** Trump plans to attend \u2018Les Mis\u00e9rables\u2019 at the Kennedy Center after taking over the institution **Trump plans to attend \u2018Les Mis\u00e9rables\u2019 at the Kennedy Center after taking over the institution** **Trump plans to attend \u2018Les Mis\u00e9rables\u2019 at the Kennedy Center after taking over the institution** Juneteenth started with handbills proclaiming freedom.
