Given her presence at Pentecost \u2014 the \u201cbirthday\u201d of the Church \u2014 the celebration of Mary under the title Mother of the Church falls on the next day, the Monday after Pentecost \u2014 June 9 this year. Marian feast days have developed over the centuries, often with local customs or historical events taking on wider significance. Consider the feast of the Holy Name of Mary, now set for Sept. 12. It had some local observances in the 15th century, with the date set close to the Nativity of Mary (Sept. 8), as the bestowal of the name was proximate to the birth. After the victory of King Jan Sobieski of Poland over the Turks at Vienna on Sept. 12, 1683, Pope Innocent XI wished to commemorate the event with a feast. (Some have speculated that the 9/11 terrorists chose the date of their attack to coincide with this anniversary.) In 1684, Innocent established the feast of the Holy Name of Mary for the Sunday after the Nativity of Mary. In the 20th century, the date was fixed for Sept. 12 to avoid coinciding with a Sunday. The calendar reforms of 1969 eliminated the feast from the General Roman Calendar, which must be observed everywhere. It was returned in the revisions made in the Jubilee Year 2000. The feast of Mary, Mother of the Church is connected to the Jubilee Year 1975. After the Second Vatican Council, there was a burst of liturgical creativity. As one would expect, there were mixed results. On the positive side, it included the development of new sets of particular prayers (\u201cpropers\u201d) for Masses on various occasions. Given that Pope St. Paul VI had formally declared Mary to be \u201cMother of the Church\u201d on Nov. 21, 1964, during Vatican II, a suitable development was an optional Mass for Mary under that title. For the Jubilee Year 1975, the Holy See approved that particular set of Mass propers, but a priest would have to make a special search for the texts. In the Great Jubilee 2000, that votive Mass for Mary, Mother of the Church, was included in the Roman Missal used every day in every parish, so it became easily accessible. Thus, when Pope Francis inserted the feast into the universal calendar in 2018, priests already had the necessary prayers in the Missal. The date was fixed for Monday after Pentecost; the relevant decree stated that \u201cas a caring guide to the emerging Church Mary had already begun her mission in the Upper Room, praying with the Apostles while awaiting the coming of the Holy Spirit (cf. Acts 1:14).\u201d Thepreface for the Massis more comprehensive than was usually the case in prior centuries, a characteristic of the new Mass propers drawn up to honor the Blessed Mother. It gives a poetic panorama of the whole of Mary\u2019s life, from \u201creceiving [the] Word in her Immaculate Heart\u201d to \u201cgiving birth to the Creator\u201d as \u201cshe nurtured the beginnings of the Church.\u201d The preface goes on to speak of Mary \u201cstanding beside the Cross\u201d where she was given to the Apostle John as his mother, and accompanying \u201cthe Apostles [who] awaited the Spirit ... [joining] her supplication to the prayers of the disciples and so became the pattern of the Church at prayer.\u201d The preface concludes with a reference to the Assumption and Mary\u2019s role as powerful intercessor, who \u201caccompanies [the] pilgrim Church with a mother\u2019s love and watches in kindness over the Church\u2019s homeward steps.\u201d That preface is one of the richest in the Roman Missal, a crown of the new Mass propers developed for the Blessed Mother, one of the loveliest fruits of the post-conciliar liturgical renewal. The reform of the liturgical calendar brought a certain order to the Marian feasts, which Paul VI emphasized in his 1974 apostolic exhortation on Marian devotion,Marialis Cultus. By way of example, for centuries the Visitation was celebrated on July 2, the day after the octave of the Nativity of John the Baptist (June 24). That was odd, as the biblical account makes it clear that Mary departed from Elizabeth\u2019s home before John was born (Luke 1:56-57). Paul VI put that right with his revision of the calendar in 1969, moving theFeast of the Visitation of the Blessed Virgin Maryto May 31, closing the Marian month and now falling between the Annunciation (March 25) and John\u2019s birth, as happened in Luke\u2019s Gospel. Previously, May 31 had been the feast of the Queenship of Mary, which was consequently moved to a much more fitting date, Aug. 22, the octave of the Assumption (Aug. 15). The fourth and fifth Glorious Mysteries now are set together liturgically. Other changes linked the cult of Mary in the calendar more closely to the mystery of Christ Jesus. The feast of the Immaculate Heart of Mary (previously in August) now follows the day after the solemn feast of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, uniting both the Sacred Heart and Immaculate Heart in the calendar. (The month of August is still dedicated to the Immaculate Heart of Mary, a relic of the earlier date of the feast.) Likewise, the feast of Our Lady of Sorrows now falls on Sept. 15, the day after the Exaltation of the Holy Cross. Previously that feast had been set for the Friday before Palm Sunday, indicating that Mary would accompany her Son through the Passion. Now, its date illustrates Mary\u2019s fidelity to the end, standing at the foot of the Cross. Previously, the feast of the Divine Maternity of Mary was observed on Oct. 11. Pope St. John XXIII chose that date to open the Second Vatican Council in 1962, a concrete expression of his plea for Marian intercession for the work then beginning. The renewed calendar elevated the feast to the highest rank, renamed it Mary, Mother of God, and assigned it to Jan. 1, to complete the Christmas octave. The Christmas Octave now begins with the birth of the baby and concludes with honoring the mother. Incidentally, that left Oct. 11 free, and so it was assigned to John XXIII for his feast day, marking the day of his greatest preaching, the opening address to Vatican II,Gaudet Mater Ecclesia(Rejoice Mother Church). As an echo of that, Pope St. John Paul II\u2019s feast day was set for Oct. 22, the date of his great \u201cBe Not Afraid\u201d homily. In the reform of 1969, the feast of St. Robert Bellarmine was moved from May 13 to Sept. 17. The former was the date of his beatification in 1923, emphasizing the juridical-legal declaration of his holiness, while the latter date was his death, hisdies natalis, date of his \u201cbirthday\u201d in heaven. That left May 13 free, which is now observed as the feast of Our Lady of Fatima, the anniversary of the first apparition in 1917 and the miraculous survival by John Paul II of the assassination attempt in 1981. The Monday after Pentecost \u2014 now Mary, Mother of the Church \u2014 fits within nearly 60 years of liturgical reform, during which the Marian dimension has become better arranged and more profound. For the Marian year 1987, the Holy See prepared aCollection of Masses of the Blessed Virgin Mary, which contained 46 Masses with propers for various Marian titles. Today\u2019s feast is also directly linked to the jubilee years of 1975 and 2000, making its observance this year of the Jubilee of Hope a particular occasion for gratitude.
