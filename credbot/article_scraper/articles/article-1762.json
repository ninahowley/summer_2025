I\u2019d down nearly a gallon of water a day and yet\u2026 I never actually felt hydrated.The wild part? I genuinely thought that was normal\u2014like maybeeveryonefelt that way.I never didanything fancy\u2014never added anything to my water or paid attention to what kind it was. But the truth is,all ofthat matters. It plays a huge role in how much water your bodyactually absorbson a cellular level.Since 2022, my hydration journey has taken a lot of twists and turns. It\u2019s been full of trial and error, but I\u2019m so happy to say I\u2019ve finally found the key to feeling truly hydrated. And honestly? It\u2019s way simpler than I expected.Hydration 101Before we get intohowto hydrate properly, let\u2019s talk aboutwhyhydration matters in the first place. It\u2019s not just about drinking water when you\u2019re thirsty. Hydration is the foundation of how your body functions on every level.The human body is made up of about 60% water. Your cells need it to bring in nutrients, eliminate waste, and keep your metabolism running smoothly. Even your energy production depends on it. The electron transport chain (which produces most of your ATP\u2014your energy currency) actuallycreateswater as part of its function and requires a well-hydrated environment to keep working.When you\u2019re dehydrated, your blood thickens, oxygen delivery slows, your brain gets foggy, and your whole system starts shutting down.Staying well-hydrated keeps your body moving like a well-oiled machine. It\u2019s one of the simplest but most powerful ways to support your health every single day\u2014which makes learning how to optimize it essential.It\u2019s also important to limit or balance certain things that contribute to dehydration, including:\u2022 Table salt\u2022 Caffeine\u2022 Alcohol\u2022 Refined sugar\u2022 Diuretic herbsThe Type of Water MattersIt\u2019s easy to assume that all water is the same\u2014that it doesn\u2019t matter what kind you drink. But I\u2019m here to tell you that\u2019s just not true. And I might ruffle some feathers here, but:reverse osmosis water isn\u2019t helping your hydration.Spring water is a much better choice.Sure, reverse osmosis is way better than purified city water because it removes things like fluoride and chlorine. But it also removesall ofthe minerals. When water is stripped of minerals, it pulls mineralsfrom your bodyto balance itself out.Sothe more you drink mineral-depleted water, the more you deplete your body\u2019s own mineral stores.For water to be truly hydrating, it needs to contain minerals your body can absorb and use. That\u2019s why spring water is a great option\u2014it naturally contains minerals. Ideally, it should come straight from the source (not bottled), because fresh spring water islivingand hasn\u2019t been filtered or processed like store-bought water.Drinking demineralized water does your body no good. But that doesn\u2019t mean you have to ditch reverse osmosis water altogether\u2014it just means you need toadd minerals (like electrolytes)to make ithydratingagain.What Are Electrolytes?Electrolytes are essential minerals that carry an electric charge when dissolved in water. They\u2019re critical for hydration, nerve function, fluid balance, muscle movement, and pH regulation.The most important mineral for hydration?Salt.But not just anysalt\u2014the right kind of salt.You can dive deeper into this in ourSalt Basics blog, which explains which salts to use, their benefits, and how other minerals help balance sodium levels.The key minerals for hydration are:\u2022 Sodium\u2022 Potassium\u2022 MagnesiumThese three work together in a delicate balance. Too few electrolytes can leave you dehydrated no matter how much water you drink, and too many can also throw things off. At a minimum, it\u2019s a good idea to drink at least one glass of water per day with added electrolytes.Best ElectrolytesWith so many electrolyte supplements on the market, it can get overwhelming. Many are loaded with refined sugars, artificial flavors, colors, and synthetic ingredients your body doesn\u2019t need (and probably doesn\u2019t want).All you really need is good salt, a small amount of natural sugar, and some potassium to keep things balanced.My personal favorite isEarthley\u2019sElectrolyte Powder\u2014it\u2019s super clean, completely natural, and works really well. It\u2019s made with high-quality salt, maple sugar, and cream of tartar.It gives you the three main electrolytes that you need to be hydrated.Agreat minimalist optionthat can provide the trace minerals you need to helpyour electrolyte balanceisTrace Minerals Drops.DIY Electrolyte RecipeWant to make your own? It\u2019s easy\u2014and a great option if you like keeping things homemade.Ingredients:\u2022 1/8 tsp cream of tartar\u2022 1/8\u20131/4 tsp Redmond Real Salt or Celtic Sea Salt\u2022 1 tbsp lemon or lime juice\u2022 1 tsp raw honey or maple syrup (optional\u2014for taste and quick energy)\u2022 2 cups filtered waterInstructions:1.
