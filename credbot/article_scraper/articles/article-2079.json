Unlike other types of dementia,NPH is often treatable and sometimes reversible. According to theCleveland Clinic, the primary symptoms are known as Hakim\u2019s triad: gait disturbances, urinary incontinence, and cognitive issues.Patients may find it difficult to lift their feet, often appearing as if they are walking on magnets.Urinary urgency or accidents can occur, and cognitive difficulties might manifest as forgetfulness, slow thinking, or mood changes. Causes of NPH can be either idiopathic (of unknown origin) or secondary,resulting from brain injuries, surgeries, or infections. Diagnosis typically involves brain imaging like MRI scans and sometimes lumbar punctures to relieve pressure. Treatment usually requires surgery to implant a shunt. This device drains excess fluid from the brain into another part of the body, typically the abdomen. According toToday,many patients show significant improvements within days of the procedure.However, outcomes are best when the condition is diagnosed early. Although NPH shares symptoms with Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s disease, it differs significantly in that the symptoms of NPH can often be reversed. Recovery times vary, but with proper medical intervention, many regain mobility and mental clarity.
