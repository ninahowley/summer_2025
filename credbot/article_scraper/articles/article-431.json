This number is already staggering and challenging to comprehend. **Now let us turn our attention to chess.** In 1950, mathematician Claude Shannon calculated an estimate for the game-tree complexity of chess, which he placed at around 10^120 (Shannon, 1950). This figure represents the number of possible iterations or unique game move sequences. **Comparing the Numbers** When we put the numbers side by side, we can see that there are indeed more possible iterations of a game of chess (10^120) than atoms in the known universe (10^80). This comparison is astonishing and demonstrates the incredible complexity and depth of the chess game. The claim that a game of chess has more possible iterations than atoms in the known universe is valid. While the number of atoms in the universe is incomprehensibly large, the possibilities in a game of chess are even more remarkable. By understanding this fact, we can appreciate the depth and complexity of the chess game and feel empowered by the knowledge that such a seemingly simple board game can surpass even the vastness of the universe in terms of possibilities.
