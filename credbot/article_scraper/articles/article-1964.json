Listen to the latest episode of \u201cQuick Start\u201d \ud83d\udc47 In a statement shared with CBN News, Al Robertson \u2014 whose family rose to fame in 2012, when their hit reality show \u201cDuck Dynasty\u201d premiered on A&E \u2014 reflected on his father\u2019s profound influence in his life. \u201cWell, it has finally happened,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe man that raised me, trained and disciplined me, accepted me, loved me and partnered with me in sharing the Gospel of Jesus has left this life and crossed over to await the Great Resurrection.\u201d Rather than lament, Robertson expressed gratitude and hope, appealing to his Christian faith to process the tragic loss with which the family is coping. \u201cI feel joyful, and even relieved, that he no longer suffers from a terrible, mind destroying disease known as Alzheimer\u2019s,\u201d Robertson continued. \u201cI am also humbled to keep his legacy going to reach as many people as possible with the saving grace of Jesus Christ\u2019s coming to earth, death, burial, resurrection and ascension.\u201d He said the past decade of working with his dad on books, podcasts, and other projects has been \u201csome of the most rewarding ministry experiences\u201d he has ever had. A post shared by Sadie Robertson Huff (@legitsadierob) \u201cI do not grieve like men with no hope and I don\u2019t say goodbye , but \u2018see you in a while\u2019 instead,\u201d he said. \u201cAs he told me over and over in my life, especially the last few years, \u2018Al, the resurrection looms larger every day for us all.\u2019 Indeed it does Dad, indeed it does.\u201d Other family members are sharing powerful messages as well, with Sadie Robertson, Phil\u2019s granddaughter, revealing one of the final things he said to her: \u201cFull strength ahead!\u201d It\u2019s a powerful reminder to power through and keep on moving even in the wake of pain and tragedy. Sadie also reflected on her grandpa\u2019s influence over her family and fans. \u201cIt was his testimony that changed his life, our families life, and thousands of others,\u201d she said, referring to Philovercomingalcoholism and finding Jesus decades ago. \u201cNow he is experiencing it in the fullness. Fully alive in Christ. The new has come.\u201d A post shared by Willie Robertson (@realwilliebosshog) Her father, Willie \u2014 Phil\u2019s son, also shared his dad\u2019s final words. \u201cThe last words he said to me as I leaned down over his weakened body was \u2018You\u2019re my brother,'\u201d Williewrotein an Instagram post. \u201cIt made total sense to me. He always told me we were coworkers in the Kingdom of God. Maybe that\u2019s why I always just called him Phil.\u201d Continue to pray for the Robertson family as they mourn the loss of Phil. The family comes back to TV June 1 with the premiere of \u201cDuck Dynasty: The Revival,\u201d a new show on A&E.
