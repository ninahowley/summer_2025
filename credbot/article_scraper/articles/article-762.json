This is the second goring incident this year. The man was among a group of visitors at the park that approached the animal too closely, officials said. The incident happened around 9:45 a.m. in the Upper Geyser Basin at Old Faithful. Officials said the man was treated by local medics and his injuries were not life-threatening. The incident is still under investigation. RELATED STORY |Invasive Asian needle ants with potentially deadly sting spreading across multiple states Another individual, a 47-year-old Florida man, was gored by a bison on May 4 in the Lake Village area of the park. His injuries were also minor. On May 4, 2025, a 47-year-old man from Cape Coral, Florida, was injured by a bison in Yellowstone National Park. Officials said there were two reported goring incidents in 2024 and one in 2023. National Park Service officials said bison are territorial and have injured more people in Yellowstone than any other animal. \"They are unpredictable and can run three times faster than humans,\" officials said. Visitors are supposed to stay more than 25 yards away from all large animals \u2014 including bison, elk, bighorn sheep, deer, moose, and coyotes \u2014 and at least 100 yards away from bears, wolves and cougars. **Sign up for theDaily Headlinesand receive up to date information.** **now signed up to receive theDaily Headlines.** Traffic News Consumer Sports Entertainment Life Marketplace Don't Waste Your Money Support Sitemap Do Not Sell My Info Privacy Policy Privacy Center Journalism Ethics Guidelines Terms of Use EEO Careers FCC Public Files FCC Application Public File Contact Accessibility Statement Scripps Media Trust Center Closed Captioning Contact kjrhtv 2newsok 2worksforyou/ KJRH2HD"}
