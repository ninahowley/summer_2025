Unlike traditional RL methods for LLMs that need expensive human data or limited annotated data, RPT uses verifiable rewards based on whether the model correctly predicts the actual next token from the vast amount of text data typically used for pre-training. This approach makes RL training scalable and general-purpose, as it leverages the existing text corpora, avoids the risk of reward hacking seen in learned reward models, and encourages the model to engage in a deliberate reasoning process before making predictions, promoting deeper understanding over simple memorization. Core method RPT At each token position in a text sequence, the model first generates a reasoning trace (chain-of-thought) and then predicts the next token. If the prediction is a valid prefix of the ground-truth continuation, a reward is assigned. Multiple rollouts are used per context, and the model is trained via on-policy RL. Better than standard pretraining RPT significantly outperforms standard next-token prediction and chain-of-thought reasoning baselines (without RL), achieving higher accuracy on tokens of varying difficulty and even rivaling larger models in performance. RPT-14B, for instance, matches or exceeds R1-Qwen-32B\u2019s accuracy on the OmniMATH benchmark. Experiments demonstrate that RPT significantly *improves next-token prediction accuracy**, shows consistent performance gains with **increased training compute**, offers a **stronger pre-trained foundation* for subsequent RL fine-tuning, and *enhances zero-shot performance* on various reasoning benchmarks compared to models trained with standard methods, even outperforming larger models in some cases. The analysis of reasoning patterns confirms that RPT fosters a different, more inferential thinking process compared to standard problem-solving approaches. Strong scaling laws RPT exhibits clean power-law scaling with respect to training compute across difficulty levels, with prediction accuracy consistently improving as compute increases, and fitting closely to theoretical curves. Promotes structured thinking Analysis of reasoning traces reveals that RPT-14B employs more hypothesis generation, deduction, and reflective patterns compared to traditional problem-solving models, supporting the claim that RPT fosters deeper reasoning habits during training.
