Username or Email Address Password Remember Me **Anime VA Megumi Hayashibara speaks out about rude foreigners: \u2018We have to crack down\u2019** In a recent blog post, veteran voice actress Megumi Hayashibara spoke out about the issues that Japanese citizens are facing in the wake of increasingly rude tourists, while also giving her opinion about benefits offered to foreigners and immigrants. Thepostin question from Hayashibara has been edited multiple times after both Japanese and international readers began to discuss and share it. Some readers have taken Hayashibara\u2019s statements as reactionary and anti-immigrant. Others believe she\u2019s explicitly referring to certain individuals who exploit Japan\u2019s culture and programs, she explicitly mentions there are foreigners who pay taxes. You can read a portion of her statement below. If things continue like this,Japan\u2019s Japaneseness will disappear,its manners, attitude, technology, food, and maybe even anime (\uff1e\u4eba\uff1c;) Of course, there are many, many people living in Japan who really love Japan. I have friends! Some have become naturalized! Among them, there are some people who run private lodgings without manners, foreign tourists who don\u2019t know how to \u201cgive in\u201d and people who cut down bamboo in Kyoto. If we don\u2019t have regulations, if we don\u2019t make them, it will be dangerous. It will be like Japanese crayfish being eaten by invasive species in an instant. Hayashibara is considered by some to be a legend of the anime industry, with rules including Rei Ayanami inNeon Genesis Evangelion, female Ranma Saotome inRanma 1/2, Ai Haibara inDetective Conan, Faye Valentine inCowboy Bebop, and those are only some of her iconic roles. Over the past several years, Japan has experienced increasingly worse problems with tourists. These tourists have been emboldened by a weakened yen and nuisance streamers likeJohnny Somali. **AboutNiche Gamer** The premiere enthusiast gaming site and community for niche and unique video games across the globe. **PopularNews** **Black Myth: Wukong launches for Xbox in August** **Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles announced** **Bloodstained: The Scarlet Engagement announced** **LatestReviews** **Review: Ohwill Chaise Sofa** **Mario Kart World Review** **Warhammer 40,000: Speed Freeks Review** About Staff Contact Got a tip?
