(Reporter Photos/Andrew Simonson) By ANDREW SIMONSON | Sports Editor MONTEVALLO \u2013For longtime Montevallo residents, Saturday, June 7 brought all the sights and sounds of one of the city\u2019s routine summer events: the sound of whistles from former college and pro players cutting through the air, the sight of kids launching themselves at tackling dummies and catching junior-sized footballs after running a route. It had all the signs of another successful Korey Cunningham Football Camp at Theron Fisher Stadium. Only one thing was missing. Cunningham himself. The 2025 edition of the camp was the first since Cunningham\u2019s tragic death in May 2024. While the former All-County star and NFL offensive lineman was not teaching skills to his hometown like in years past, his friends and family banded together to keep his legacy alive through one of his favorite traditions. \u201cToday is very special because this is something our son Korey would have loved to carry on himself, and we just want to carry on his legacy,\u201d Cunningham\u2019s mother Kathy Cunningham said. \u201cWe just feel like he\u2019s there smiling down on us today, and just to see all these kids and parents come out and be so supportive, this just means the world to us.\u201d During the three-hour event, kids from ages 5-18 rotated between a series of stations where they learned skills like tackling, catching, route-running and more. Cunningham\u2019s former college teammates at Cincinnati led the stations, bringing their experience from the college and pro levels to the kids in Montevallo while Cunningham\u2019s family and Montevallo head football coach Garrett Langer facilitated the camp. Many of Cunningham\u2019s former teammates flew in from out-of-state and reunited for the first time in years just to run the one-night camp in a small town in Alabama, including Deyshawn Bond, a former offensive lineman with the University of Cincinnati and Indianapolis Colts. \u201cIt\u2019s a blessing,\u201d Bond said. \u201cAll grace to God. He\u2019s given us the heart, given his family the strength to continue his legacy through this camp. So we just are thankful, and bringing all the guys here is like a reunion for the offensive linemen, so it\u2019s awesome to do that for him.\u201d For another one of his Cincinnati teammates, Garrett Campbell, it was an incredible moment to see his football family once again. He said that Cunningham always had a way of bringing people together, and that spirit continued even in his absence. \u201cIt\u2019s surreal,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cSome of these guys I haven\u2019t seen for a really long time. And, even though Korey\u2019s not here, he still has the ability to kind of bring us together, and that\u2019s kind of how he always was. He was the glue guy. He was the lover. He was the best friend. And I think that shows out in a lot of us, and all of us making it down here and how many of us made it down here, I think it\u2019s a true embodiment of who he was as a person.\u201d To Bond, Cunningham was a man of deep faith who loved and supported others as a reflection of his love for God. He is honored to have been impacted by Cunningham during his lifetime and feels blessed to pay that forward to others. \u201cAmazing man. A God-fearing man,\u201d Bond said of Cunningham. \u201cDefinitely brought me back to faith. Just with everything he did, he always praised God. And we\u2019re thankful for that here on earth because this gives us something to live forward for and gives us hope that God is really blessing us to be able to continue his legacy.\u201d Much of the process of getting the players on board was through Kathy, who reached out to her son\u2019s agent and his former teammates. Some of his teammates who are still in the NFL couldn\u2019t make it due to mandatory minicamp and offseason team activities (OTAs), but many of his Cincinnati teammates were more than willing to come down. \u201cEverybody\u2019s just been wonderful,\u201d Kathy said. \u201cI call them up, text them, and they\u2019re like, \u2018Oh, yeah, tell us when, where, we\u2019ll clear our schedule and we\u2019ll be there.\u2019 And they have shown up.\u201d Them showing up makes Kathy feel grateful for their love and support even after Cunningham\u2019s death. She believes that them making the time and effort to come to Montevallo shows that they truly loved her son. \u201cIt shows that when they said that they loved him, they loved him,\u201d Kathy said. \u201cLove is what it does, and they have shown that today through their actions, through their words, through their continued support.\u201d Campbell said it was an easy decision to come down to Montevallo to continue to support the Cunningham family the same way they have supported him for years. He feels a deep bond with the Cunninghams that his other teammates echoed as well. \u201cExtremely important,\u201d Campbell said of coming for the camp. \u201cWe are second family to his family. That\u2019s my second mom, second sister, second dad, second brother, etc., and I know a lot of the guys around here feel the same way, and we stay in contact with Korey\u2019s family. So, it means a lot to them, I know, but it also means a lot to us for them to invite us down here. It\u2019s a privilege to be down here, it really is, and to have known Korey.\u201d While players like Campbell and Bond aren\u2019t from Montevallo, they can see a lot of Cunningham\u2019s characteristics in its residents. Now, they are entrusted to teach the game of football in hopes of helping more Montevallo residents achieve the same success Cunningham did in his collegiate career at Cincinnati and five-season NFL career with the Cardinals, Patriots and Giants. \u201cIt explains a lot of Korey,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cWe come from a lot of different places and a lot of different backgrounds and being here kind of helps us understand Korey a little better, even though he\u2019s not here. And being able to give back in his stead, we know that he\u2019s just looking down, smiling, seeing us do it in purpose of him because I know he would be here and this is kind of something that he really cherished doing, and so to be able to continue that for him means a great deal to us.\u201d Bond agreed with Campbell and said he felt blessed to have the chance to teach football to kids in the area. \u201cIt feels good,\u201d Bond said. \u201cYou never know where you\u2019re going to end up and helping kids learn football. So here in Montevallo, Alabama, who knew we would be here to help these kids? And by the grace of God, we\u2019re here through Korey and through God as our strength. So, this is a blessing.\u201d Cunningham was the first player from Montevallo to make it to the NFL but remains the lone resident to make it to the big stage. The hope is that camps like this can inspire more residents to follow his example and achieve great things. However, Kathy hopes her son\u2019s legacy is more than his on-field achievements. She hopes the campers see the heart that made him beloved throughout the town as \u201cBig Country,\u201d a man who truly loved Montevallo and wanted to see it improve. \u201cBecause I think the younger guys, they see that putting it in hard work, and that you can be remembered for that and having a big heart that you can be remembered and some people would just like to carry that on,\u201d Kathy said about the importance of the camp. At the end of the day, that\u2019s why the kids are still working and the coaches are still teaching at the Korey Cunningham Memorial Football Camp\u2013to be the earthly hands and feet of Cunningham\u2019s continued influence and impact. \u201cI just feel like our son has a life that goes beyond him leaving us and that it still shows that his love for his community and his friends and family carries on,\u201d Kathy said. **Lord Wedgwood Charity donates lifesaving Automated External Defibrillators to American Village** **Montevallo City Council approves new sign for fire station** **Swinging for the fences: 2025 All-County Team spotlights softball\u2019s stars** **Montevallo continues growing soccer at second-annual youth camp** PollsWhat would make you consider a digital subscription to Shelby County Reporter?Low subscription costUnlimited content accessExclusive news/event informationView ResultsLoading ... **Polls** What would make you consider a digital subscription to Shelby County Reporter?
