Milei\u2019s visit began with a prayer at the Western Wall in Jerusalem\u2014his second since taking office\u2014before he met Israeli President Isaac Herzog and later, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. In a joint statement with Herzog, Milei reiterated his unwavering support for Israel amid global criticism of its ongoing military operations in Gaza and the humanitarian crisis in the strip.

He praised Israel as \u201ca beacon of light that shines over the path to freedom and the commitment to civilization\u201d for refusing to \u201ccowardly surrender\u201d to Hamas. He also highlighted the suffering of Argentines during the October 7 Hamas attack, which killed 27 Argentine citizens and led to 21 being taken hostage\u2014four of whom, Eitan Horn, Ariel and David Cunio, and Lior Rudaeff, are still held in Gaza. Milei forcefully demanded their release and is scheduled to meet with relatives of kidnapped Argentines, showing solidarity and empathy. In his meeting with Prime Minister Netanyahu, Milei presented a heartfelt gift: a photograph of himself and the Lubavitcher Rebbe. The exchange was steeped in personal reflection and shared values. Netanyahu reminisced, \u201cYou know, the Lubavitcher Rebbe told me that when you go to the UN\u2014a house of lies and darkness\u2014if you light a single candle, people can see the truth from afar.\u201d Milei responded, \u201cIf you check out my speech at the UN, it has a lot of what the Rebbe told you.\u201d Netanyahu added, \u201cHe was like a prophet, and he had laser blue eyes. He was so clear and prophetic.\u201d Milei\u2019s show of solidarity comes as Israel faces increasing international pressure. Top EU diplomats have accused Israel of exceeding self-defense in Gaza. French President Emmanuel Macron recently described Israel\u2019s blockade on humanitarian aid as \u201ca disgrace\u201d and renewed calls for a ceasefire. Despite such criticism, Milei made clear his government\u2019s unflinching support, stating Argentina would stand \u201cfirm beside\u201d Israel through these challenging times. Milei also emphasized the importance of truth and resilience, echoing the Rebbe\u2019s teachings about lighting a candle in the darkness, a message he incorporated into his own recent speech at the United Nations. This trip marks Milei\u2019s longest international journey as president. His nine-day tour has taken him from the Vatican, Italy, Spain, and France, culminating in Israel. On Wednesday, he will visit the Holy Sepulcher, meet with more hostage families, and receive the Genesis Prize\u2014sometimes called the \u201cJewish Nobel Prize\u201d\u2014which Israel awarded him in January for his steadfast support during the conflict. Throughout his visit, Milei has ratified Argentina\u2019s alignment with Israel, both in combating terrorism and defending democratic values. As the war in Gaza continues, Milei\u2019s message remains clear: Argentina stands shoulder to shoulder with Israel and demands justice for the victims of terrorism, both Israeli and Argentine. **Comments (0)** **Our Whatsapp Group** **Our Whatsapp Group** **Follow us On** **453k** **453k** **12k** **12k** **1.6k** **1.6k** **Join Our Newsletter** Stay connected with the pulse of the Jewish community!
