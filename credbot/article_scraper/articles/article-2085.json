Perhaps they will allow more nuclear electricity to be generated at a low cost and with much less of a problem with spent fuel. As I analyze the situation, however, the problems associated with nuclear electricity generation are more complex and immediate than most people perceive. My analysis shows thatthe world is already dealing with \u201cnot enough uranium from mines to go around.\u201dIn particular, US production of uranium \u201cpeaked\u201dabout 1980 (Figure 1). For many years, the US was able to down-blend nuclear warheads (both purchased from Russia and from its own supply) to get around its uranium supply deficit. Today, the inventory of nuclear warheads has dropped quite low. There are few warheads available for down-blending. This is creating a limit on uranium supply that is only now starting to hit. Nuclear warheads, besides providing uranium in general, are important for the fact that they provide a concentrated source of uranium-235, which is the isotope of uranium that can sustain a nuclear reaction. With the warhead supply depleting, the US has a second huge problem: developing a way to produce nuclear fuel, probably mostly from spent fuel, with the desired high concentration of uranium-235. Today, Russia is the primary supplier of enriched uranium. The plan of the US is touse government research grants to kickstart work on new small modular nuclear reactorsthat will be more efficient than current nuclear plants. These reactors will use a new fuel with a higher concentration of uranium-235 than is available today, except through purchase from Russia.Grants are also being given to start work on US production of the more highly enriched uranium fuel within the US.It is hoped that most of this highly enriched uranium can come from recycling spent nuclear fuel, thus helping to solve the problem of what to do with the supply of spent fuel. My analysis indicates that while advanced modular nuclear reactors might theoretically be helpful for the very long term, they cannot fix the problems of the US, and other countries in the West, nearly quickly enough. I expect that the Trump administration, which will start in January 2025, will see this program as a boondoggle. **[1] Current problems with nuclear electricity generation are surprisingly hidden. World electricity generation from nuclear has been close to flat since 2004.** Although there was a dip in world generation of nuclear electricity after the tsunami that affected nuclear reactors in Fukushima, Japan, in 2011, otherwise world production of nuclear electricity has been nearly flat since 2004 (Figure 3). US nuclear electricity production (Figure 4) shows a similar pattern, except that production since 2021 is down. **[2] The total amount of electricity generated by nuclear power plants is limited by the amount of uranium fuel available to them.** I believe that a major reason why the electricity supply from nuclear has been quite flat since 2004 is because total nuclear electricity generation is limited by the quantity of uranium fuel that is available for the nuclear reactors that have been built. The price of uranium can perhaps rise, but this doesn\u2019t necessarily add much (or any) supply very quickly. It takes several years to develop a new uranium mine. In theory, reprocessing of spent fuel to produce uranium and plutonium is also possible, but the amount of that has been performed to date is small. (See Section [6].) **[3] The World Nuclear Association (WNA) published Figure 5 that hints at the world\u2019s uranium supply problem:** The black line showing \u201creactor requirements\u201d (Figure 5) is in some sense comparable to world generation of nuclear electricity (Figure 3). Both figures show fairly flat lines since about 2004. This relationship hints that there has not been a significant improvement in the efficiency of electricity generation using uranium fuel in the past 20 years. Figure 5 shows a huge gap between the production of uranium from the various countries and \u201creactor requirements.\u201d The single largest source of additional supply has been down-blended uranium from nuclear bombs. TheEIA reportsthat the US purchased a large number of nuclear warheads from Russia between 1995 and 2013 for this purpose under the Megatons to Megawatts program. The EIAalso reportsthat for the period 2013 to 2022, a purchase agreement was put in place allowing the US to purchase commercial origin low-enriched uranium from Russia to replace some of down-blended nuclear warhead material. In addition, the US had some of its own nuclear warheads that it could blend down. It was the availability of uranium supply from these various sources that allowed US nuclear electricity generation to remain relatively flat in the 2004 to 2023 period, as shown on Figure 4. The US\u2019s own uranium extraction reached a peak about 1980 and is now close to zero (Figure 1). The world\u2019s supply of warheads is now over 85% depleted, leaving very little stored-away, highly enriched uranium to blend down (Figure 2) A hidden problem is the fact that uranium production available today is largely from Russia and its close affiliates. The data underlying Figure 5 shows that uranium production in 2022 is dominated by close allies of Russia (55% of the total coming from Kazakhstan (43% of total), Uzbekistan (7% of total), and Russia (5% of total)). The US (at almost 0%), plus production of its close affiliates, Canada and Australia, provided only 24% of world uranium. This imbalance between Russia and its affiliates, and the US and its affiliates, should be of concern. **[4] The current conflict between the US and Russia adds to nuclear problems.** The US is trying to impose sanctions on Russia. TheEIA reports: \u201cThe origin of uranium used in U.S. reactors will likely change in the coming years. In May [2024], the United Statesbanned importsof uranium products from Russia beginning in August [2024], although companies may apply for waivers through January 1, 2028.\u201d This seems to imply that a transition away from Russian uranium dependence must be made in only a little over three years. This is a short time frame, given the difficulty in making such a transition. EIA data showthat in the year 2023, the US sourced only 4.6% of uranium supplies from the US. (This could be partly or mostly down-blended nuclear warheads). Material purchased from Russia comprised 11.7% of uranium. Kazakhstan provided 20.6% of uranium purchased, and Uzbekistan provided 9.5%. Among US allies, Canada provided 14.9%, and Australia 9.2%. **[5] The WNA does not hint at any uranium supply problems.** The WNA is an advocate for nuclear energy; it cannot suggest that there is any problem with uranium supplies. WNA has the opinion that if there is a shortage of uranium, prices will rise, and more will become available. But even if prices rise, it takes several years to bring new mines into operation. Prices need to stay high, or companies will not pursue what appear to be opportunities. Readers of OurFiniteWorld.com have seen that oil prices tend to spike and collapse. They don\u2019t stay high for very long because if prices stay high, the end products made with oil tend to become unaffordable. I expect a similar problem occurs with uranium. The necessary price threshold for high uranium extractionthat is mentionedby the WNA is $130/kg in 2021. By coincidence, when a translation is made to dollars per pound using 2024$, this corresponds quite closely to the current price line on Figure 6. Indeed, prices do sometimes bounce high. The problem is getting them to stay as high as the dotted line for long enough to support the multi-decade life of a mine. Economists were forecasting a price of$300 per barrel oila few years ago, but they have been disappointed. The price is under $75 per barrel now. The country with themost potentially recoverable uraniumis Australia. It produced only 9% of the world\u2019s uranium in 2022, but is reported to have 28% of the world\u2019s remaining reserve.Consistently higher priceswould be needed for Australia to start opening new mines. It is also possible that more uranium supply might become available if improved extraction techniques are developed. The world seems to bepast peak crude oil. By itself, the peak oil issue could limit new uranium extraction and transport. **[6] Recycling of spent fuel to recover usable uranium and plutonium has been accomplished only to a limited extent. Experience to date suggests that recycling has many issues.** It is possible to make an estimate of the amount of recycling of spent fuel that is currently being performed. Figure 3 in Section [1] shows about 65,000 metric tons of uranium are required to meet the demands of existing nuclear power generation, and that as of 2022, there was about an annual shortfall in supply of about 26%. Based on what information I have been able to gather, existing recycling of uranium and plutonium amounts to perhaps 6% of the overall fuel requirement. Thus, as of 2022,today\u2019s recycling of spent fuel could perhaps shave this shortfall in uranium supply to \u201conly\u201d 20% of annual nuclear fuel requirements. There is some recycling of spent fuel, but it is small in relation to the amount needed. There seem to be several issues with building units to recover uranium from spent fuel: Higher cost than simply mining more uranium Pollution problems from the recycling plants Potential for use of the output to make nuclear warheads Potential for nuclear accidents within the plants Remaining radioactivity at the site at the end of the reprocessing plant\u2019s life, and thus the need to decommission such plants Potential for many protestors disrupting construction and operation because of issues (2), (3), (4), and (5) The US outlawed recycling of spent fuel in 1977, after a few not-very-successful attempts. Once the purchase of Russian warheads was arranged, down-blending of warheads was a much less expensive approach than reprocessing spent fuel.Physics Todayrecently reported the following regarding US reprocessing: \u201cA plant in West Valley, New York, reprocessed spent fuel for six years before closing in 1972. Looking to expand the plant, the owners balked at the costs required for upgrades needed to meet new regulatory standards. Construction of a reprocessing plant in Barnwell, South Carolina, was halted in 1977 following the Carter administration\u2019s ban.\u201d Japan has been trying to build a commercial spent fuelreprocessing plant at Rokkashosince 1993, but it has had huge problems with cost overruns and protests by many groups. Thelatest estimateof when the plant will actually be completed is fiscal year 2026 or 2027. The plant would process 800 metric tons of fuel per year. The largest commercial spent fuel reprocessing plant in operation is inLa Hague, France. It has been in place long enough (since 1966) that it has run into the issue of decommissioning an old unit, which was started as a French military project. The first processing unit was shut down in 2003. TheInternational Atomic Energy Administrationsays, \u201cThe UP2-400 decommissioning project began some 20 years ago and may be expected to continue for several more years.\u201d It talks about the huge cost and number of people involved. It says, \u201cDecommissioning activities represent roughly 20 per cent of the overall activity and socio-economic impact of the La Hague site, which also hosts two operating spent fuel recycling plants.\u201d The cost of the La Hague reprocessing units is probably not fully known. They were built by government agencies. They have gone through various owners including AREVA. AREVA has had hugefinancial problems. The successor company is Orano. Thecurrently operating unitshave the capacity to process about 1,700 metric tons of fuel per year. The 1700 metric tons of reprocessing of spent fuel from La Hagueis reported tobe nearly half of the world\u2019s operating capacity for recycling spent fuel. I understand thatRussia is working on approachesthat quite possibly are not included in my figures. If so, this may add to world uranium supply, but Russia is not likely to want to share the benefits with the West if there is not enough to go around. **[7] The concentration of the isotope uranium-235 is very important in making fuel for the proposed new modular nuclear reactors.** Uranium-235 makes up 0.72% of natural uranium.Wikipedia says, \u201cUnlike the predominant isotope uranium-238, it [uranium-235] is fissile, i. e., it can sustain a nuclear reaction.\u201d Inmost reactors used today, the concentration of uranium-235 is 3% to 5%. According to CNN, the plan in building advanced modular small reactors is to use fuel with a 5% to 20% concentration of uranium-235. Fuel at this concentration is calledhigh assay low-enriched uranium, or HALEU. The expectation is that power plants with this type of fuel will be more efficient to operate. Producing higher concentrations of uranium-235 tends to be problematic unless nuclear weapons are available for down-blending; warheads use high concentrations of uranium-235. Now, with reduced availability of nuclear warheads for down-blending, other sources are needed in addition.CNN reportsthat the only commercial source of HALEU is Russia. TheEIA reportsthat the Inflation Reduction Act invested $700 million to support the development of a domestic supply chain for HALEU. **[8] The US is trying to implement many new ideas at one time with virtually no successful working models to smooth the transition.** Strangely enough, the US has no working model of a small-scale nuclear reactor, even one operating on conventional fuel. A CNBC article from September 2024 says,Small nuclear reactors could power the world, the challenge is building the first one in the US. The new small-scale nuclear projects we do have are still at a very preliminary stage. In June 2024,Bill Gates wrote, \u201cWe just broke ground on America\u2019s first next-gen nuclear facility. Kemmerer, Wyoming will soon be home to the most advanced nuclear facility in the world.\u201d Theplan is for itis to become operational by 2030, if it has access to HALEU fuel. With respect to how far along the ability to make HALEU from spent fuel is, an October 2024 article inInteresting Engineeringsays, \u201cUS approves new facility design concept to turn nuclear waste into reactor fuel:\u201d \u201cThe facility whose conceptual design has been approved will be located at Idaho National Laboratory (INL). It will help turn used material recovered from DOE\u2019s former Experimental Breeder Reactor-II (EBR-II reactor) into usable fuel for its advanced nuclear power plant. . . The plan is to recover approximately 10 metric tons of HALEU from EBR-II fuel by December 2028 using an electrochemical process that was perfected over the years at Idaho National Laboratory (INL).\u201d Assuming this can be done, it will be a step forward, but it is nowhere near being an at-scale, commercial project that can be done economically by other companies. The volume of 10 metric tons is tiny. Starting at this level, it is difficult to see how reactors with the new technology and the HALEU fuel to feed them can possibly be available in quantity before 2050. **[9] It is difficult to see how the cost of electricity generated using the new advanced modular nuclear reactors and the new HALEU fuel, created by reprocessing spent fuel, could be low.** As far as I can see,the main argument that these new modular electricity generation plants will be affordable is that they will only generate a relatively small amount of electricity at once\u2014about 300 megawatts or less, or about one third of the average of conventional nuclear reactors in the US. Because of the smaller electricity output, the hope is that they will be affordable by more buyers, such as utility companies. The issue that is often overlooked by economists is that electricity generated using these new techniques needs to be low cost, per kilowatt-hour, to be helpful.High-cost electricity is not affordable.Keeping costs down when many new approaches are being tried for the first time is likely to be a huge hurdle. I look through the long list of problems encountered in recycling spent fuel mentioned in Section [6] and wonder whether these issues can be inexpensively worked around. There are also issues with adopting and installing the proposed new advanced modular reactors, such as security, that I have not even tried to address. The hope is that somehow, the whole process of building the advanced modular nuclear reactors and creating the HALEU fuel can be standardized and can be organized in such a way that economies of scale will set in. It seems to me that reaching this goal will be difficult. In theory, perhaps such a goal can be reached in 2060 or 2070, but this is not nearly soon enough, given the world\u2019s current shortage of uranium from mines. **[10] The Trump administration will likely drop or substantially change the current program for advanced modular nuclear reactors.** The US plan that is discussed in this post has been developed under the Biden administration. This group was voted out of power on November 5. The Democratic administration will be replaced by a new Republican administration, headed by Donald Trump, on January 20, 2025. I would not be surprised if the advanced modular nuclear generation plan disappears, almost as quickly as the currently subsidized offshore wind program, which Trump has vowed to end. The two programs have many things in common: Both programs provide an excuse for more US debt; they provide many jobs for researchers; and the devices that they relate to can be purchased in fairly small increments. But the cost per kilowatt-hour of electricity is likely to be high with either program. In some sense, as they are currently envisioned, they will not efficient ways to produce electricity.A major problem is the lack of fuel for the new modular reactors, and the slow ramp-up time to obtain this fuel. I expect that under Trump, the sanction against purchasing HALEU from Russia might be replaced with a tariff. That way the US could have the benefit of HALEU, purchased from Russia, but at a higher price. This would allow research to continue, if desired. **[11] If solutions cannot be found, electricity generation from nuclear is likely to gradually disappear.** Over time, the world\u2019s self-organizing economy tends to eliminate its more inefficient parts. When I look at the past experience with nuclear, what I see seems to be another example of the self-organizing economy squeezing out the inefficient parts of the economy (Figure 7): In this chart, \u201cAdvanced Economies, ex US\u201d are defined as members of the Organization for Economic Development (OECD), excluding the US. \u201cLater Entrants\u201d are non-OECD members, excluding Russia and Ukraine. They include China, India, Indonesia, and many other lower-income countries. Many of these countries are in East Asia. What I see is that the relatively \u201cflat\u201d overall nuclear electricity production has been accomplished, to a significant extent, by the \u201cAdvanced Economies, ex US\u201d dropping back in their use of nuclear electricity at close to the same time the \u201cLater Entrants\u201d have rapidly been increasing their use of nuclear electricity. The Later Entrants can make goods for sale in international markets much more cheaply than the Advanced Economies, ex US through their efficient use of cheap energy (often from coal) and their lower wages. This more efficient approach gives the Later Entrants an \u201cedge\u201d in buying the uranium that is available. I expect to see more of this pattern of squeezing out in the future. In fact, new and recently re-opened nuclear plants will need to compete existing nuclear generation units for available uranium. Given the way squeezing out takes place, very few people will realize that there is a problem with uranium fuel. It will just be that leaders of some parts of the world, as well as some parts of the US, will start emphasizing stories about how dangerous nuclear energy is. Instead of nuclear, they will emphasize electricity generation from wind and solar and allow these approaches to \u201cgo first\u201d when they are available. The result will be wholesale electricity prices that will be far too low for nuclear power plants, much of the time. It will be these low wholesale electricity prices that push nuclear power out. Thus, unless there truly are breakthroughs in recycling spent fuels, or in uranium mining, electricity generation using nuclear energy may gradually slip away from many parts of the world currently using it. **Share this:** Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window)Email Click to print (Opens in new window)Print Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)Reddit Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Facebook Click to share on X (Opens in new window)X Click to share on X (Opens in new window)X Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)LinkedIn **Like this:** **About Gail Tverberg** **1,824 Responses toNuclear electricity generation has hidden problems; don\u2019t expect advanced modular units to solve them.** postkeysays:December 1, 2024 at 7:06 pm\u201che ran on a promise not to go to war0:06he said I I I I won\u2019t get you in war we\u2019ll have peace peace will break out he made certain statements about you know0:13talking about normalizing relations with Iran not seeking regime change um looking for the potential to lift0:19sanctions he made the same statement about Russia and Ukraine and then he hires uh a national security adviser0:25Michael Waltz who\u2019s just a lunatic on both issues uh a secretary State Marco0:30Rubio who is a lunatic on on both issues um and then this Sebastian Gorka comes0:36in who\u2019s literally insane I mean the man is you saw this he\u2019s he\u2019s this is not0:41the language of um the you know somebody who supposed to be advising a president whose policies are uh leaning towards0:49peace um he\u2019s a warmonger um so is Michael Walt so is Marco Rubio and um0:58I Donald Trump is making the same mistake mistake that he made last time1:03surrounding himself with people who seek confrontation\u201d?https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTDoI8U626YLoading... \u201che ran on a promise not to go to war0:06he said I I I I won\u2019t get you in war we\u2019ll have peace peace will break out he made certain statements about you know0:13talking about normalizing relations with Iran not seeking regime change um looking for the potential to lift0:19sanctions he made the same statement about Russia and Ukraine and then he hires uh a national security adviser0:25Michael Waltz who\u2019s just a lunatic on both issues uh a secretary State Marco0:30Rubio who is a lunatic on on both issues um and then this Sebastian Gorka comes0:36in who\u2019s literally insane I mean the man is you saw this he\u2019s he\u2019s this is not0:41the language of um the you know somebody who supposed to be advising a president whose policies are uh leaning towards0:49peace um he\u2019s a warmonger um so is Michael Walt so is Marco Rubio and um0:58I Donald Trump is making the same mistake mistake that he made last time1:03surrounding himself with people who seek confrontation\u201d? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTDoI8U626Y \u201che ran on a promise not to go to war0:06he said I I I I won\u2019t get you in war we\u2019ll have peace peace will break out he made certain statements about you know0:13talking about normalizing relations with Iran not seeking regime change um looking for the potential to lift0:19sanctions he made the same statement about Russia and Ukraine and then he hires uh a national security adviser0:25Michael Waltz who\u2019s just a lunatic on both issues uh a secretary State Marco0:30Rubio who is a lunatic on on both issues um and then this Sebastian Gorka comes0:36in who\u2019s literally insane I mean the man is you saw this he\u2019s he\u2019s this is not0:41the language of um the you know somebody who supposed to be advising a president whose policies are uh leaning towards0:49peace um he\u2019s a warmonger um so is Michael Walt so is Marco Rubio and um0:58I Donald Trump is making the same mistake mistake that he made last time1:03surrounding himself with people who seek confrontation\u201d? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTDoI8U626Y Gail Tverbergsays:December 1, 2024 at 6:26 pmThis ZeroHedge article is difficult, but I am afraid the author may be onto something.The author talks about a possible upcoming liquidity crisis, perhaps at the time everyone makes a dash for cash to make payments for the April 15 deadline.

Hideawaysays:November 30, 2024 at 6:16 pmUsing around 4,000 tonnes of liquid oxygen per launch of starship, at 70 launches/d for Keith\u2019s power satellites, would require 280,000 tonnes of liquid oxygen per day or around 102,000,000 tonnes/ year, which is around current global capacity of production for all other purposes..So we\u2019d need to double world liquid oxygen production, which is more growth here on Earth to get the plan started, plus of course the extra 61TWh of energy to run these extra liquid oxygen producers..It\u2019s always all the extra that needs to be built here on Earth before any of these plans come to fruition that get left out of calculations of energy required to build everything first. We need more mining for the raw materials to build the plants that make the liquid oxygen, on top of what we do at present.Basically it means the current system of civilization has to continue to be in growth mode for decades more for any of it to be built, which we mostly agree is simply not going to happen for much longer.Once we are in energy decline here on Earth, without enough energy and materials to maintain and operate existing systems, which already takes 97%-99% of all energy used, then every pie in the sky concept will be left in fairytale land, as building all the new will simply not be possible as people just try to survive.Once energy availability is in decline, with feedback loops accelerating the downside availability in energy and materials, just getting enough food to cities will become very, very difficult, let alone building anything new\u2026.Loading...Peter Cassidysays:November 30, 2024 at 6:37 pmThe energy cost of cryogenic LOX is about 250kWh/tonne.https://www.aceee.org/files/proceedings/2007/data/papers/78_6_080.pdfOf the many potential problems involved in scaling up rocket launches to these levels, LOX availability is one of the least concerning.

Could shortages of fuel be a problem?According to Wiki, Starship has total takeoff propellant mass of 3400 tonnes. The oxidiser-fuel ratio is 3.6:1. This implies 740 tonnes of methane are consumed per launch.https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_StarshipIf we were to launch 70 Starships every day, we would be consuming 51,800 tonnes of methane per day. Methane has density of 0.657kg/m3. So that is 79 million cubic metres per day, or 28.8bn m3/yr. World production of natural gas in 2022,was 4.1 trillion m3.https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_natural_gas_productionSo 70 Starship flights each day would increase annual global natural gas consumption by 0.7%. This is not a negligible addition to global energy consumption. But it is small.gLoading...Hideawaysays:November 30, 2024 at 7:41 pmYou need to include the booster fuel, then main engine fuel that I notice many articles leave out. Total is around 4,600 tonnes of which 920 tonnes is methane and 3,680 tonnes is liquid oxygen.I was clearly talking about the liquid oxygen component and what needs to be built here on Earth to produce it.The methane itself looks OK, but if all sorts of uses spring up for it when oil is in decline, assuming we don\u2019t quickly Kollapse, then the price may become much higher than present, which makes all the costs too high.I would suggest that if everything held together, it would still take over 2 decades for everything to be in place to allow 70 launches per day. Every single Starship launch is just one minor fault away from being a complete failure that authorities may then step in and require major overhauls before allowing further launches.Every plan about the future I see, allows for everything to work perfectly, plus become cheaper, all while it takes more energy to mine lower grades of every metal and mineral our civilization uses.Loading...Giansays:December 1, 2024 at 3:24 amWhat leaves me most doubtful about the ability to launch the starship frequently is the heat shield. Inspecting thousands and thousands of tiles could be time-consuming and above all can undermine the possibility of reusing the rocket for dozens and dozens of times. Starship seems a some sort of Shuttle 2.0 and even at that time there was a high expectation regarding the fast reusability and the cost to access to space. The Falcon 9 booster has been reused 20 times but has never been subjected to the stresses of an 8 km/s reentry from LEO and the faster turnaround for the booster is 14 days. I do find that the \u201cStoke space\u201d approach with the heat shield with regenerative cooling is more sustainable if it works.Loading...Peter Cassidysays:December 1, 2024 at 3:48 amAgreed.

It is hard to believe that SpaceX could not have found a better engineering solution for a reentry shield.Loading... What leaves me most doubtful about the ability to launch the starship frequently is the heat shield. Inspecting thousands and thousands of tiles could be time-consuming and above all can undermine the possibility of reusing the rocket for dozens and dozens of times. Starship seems a some sort of Shuttle 2.0 and even at that time there was a high expectation regarding the fast reusability and the cost to access to space. The Falcon 9 booster has been reused 20 times but has never been subjected to the stresses of an 8 km/s reentry from LEO and the faster turnaround for the booster is 14 days.

Using around 4,000 tonnes of liquid oxygen per launch of starship, at 70 launches/d for Keith\u2019s power satellites, would require 280,000 tonnes of liquid oxygen per day or around 102,000,000 tonnes/ year, which is around current global capacity of production for all other purposes.. So we\u2019d need to double world liquid oxygen production, which is more growth here on Earth to get the plan started, plus of course the extra 61TWh of energy to run these extra liquid oxygen producers.. It\u2019s always all the extra that needs to be built here on Earth before any of these plans come to fruition that get left out of calculations of energy required to build everything first. We need more mining for the raw materials to build the plants that make the liquid oxygen, on top of what we do at present. Basically it means the current system of civilization has to continue to be in growth mode for decades more for any of it to be built, which we mostly agree is simply not going to happen for much longer. Once we are in energy decline here on Earth, without enough energy and materials to maintain and operate existing systems, which already takes 97%-99% of all energy used, then every pie in the sky concept will be left in fairytale land, as building all the new will simply not be possible as people just try to survive. Once energy availability is in decline, with feedback loops accelerating the downside availability in energy and materials, just getting enough food to cities will become very, very difficult, let alone building anything new\u2026.

Everyone forgets all the energy inputs of all the workers in all the mines, processing facilities, smelters and factories, let alone truck drivers, couriers etc, and the actual energy they use, which we count in dollar terms, instead of energy terms. But all those people use real energy to exist and get to work each day with the dollars paid to them. Every time we have to add something to civilization, the rest is expected to exist as per usual, and our \u2018as per usual\u2019 mode is growth as it has been for over 200 years. Keith, you missed the biggie in all of it, as does everyone discussing the energy use of these things. It\u2019s all the people involved that have energy use on top of current energy use. All the employees from management down that turn up to the factories every single day. Also it\u2019s interesting how you and Peter both want to talk LNG when it\u2019s the liquid oxygen that needs to double on a world wide scale.

Peter Cassidysays:November 30, 2024 at 7:21 pmHow much fuel does Starship consume? Could shortages of fuel be a problem?According to Wiki, Starship has total takeoff propellant mass of 3400 tonnes. The oxidiser-fuel ratio is 3.6:1. This implies 740 tonnes of methane are consumed per launch.https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_StarshipIf we were to launch 70 Starships every day, we would be consuming 51,800 tonnes of methane per day. Methane has density of 0.657kg/m3. So that is 79 million cubic metres per day, or 28.8bn m3/yr. World production of natural gas in 2022,was 4.1 trillion m3.https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_natural_gas_productionSo 70 Starship flights each day would increase annual global natural gas consumption by 0.7%. This is not a negligible addition to global energy consumption. But it is small.gLoading...Hideawaysays:November 30, 2024 at 7:41 pmYou need to include the booster fuel, then main engine fuel that I notice many articles leave out. Total is around 4,600 tonnes of which 920 tonnes is methane and 3,680 tonnes is liquid oxygen.I was clearly talking about the liquid oxygen component and what needs to be built here on Earth to produce it.The methane itself looks OK, but if all sorts of uses spring up for it when oil is in decline, assuming we don\u2019t quickly Kollapse, then the price may become much higher than present, which makes all the costs too high.I would suggest that if everything held together, it would still take over 2 decades for everything to be in place to allow 70 launches per day. Every single Starship launch is just one minor fault away from being a complete failure that authorities may then step in and require major overhauls before allowing further launches.Every plan about the future I see, allows for everything to work perfectly, plus become cheaper, all while it takes more energy to mine lower grades of every metal and mineral our civilization uses.Loading...Giansays:December 1, 2024 at 3:24 amWhat leaves me most doubtful about the ability to launch the starship frequently is the heat shield. Inspecting thousands and thousands of tiles could be time-consuming and above all can undermine the possibility of reusing the rocket for dozens and dozens of times. Starship seems a some sort of Shuttle 2.0 and even at that time there was a high expectation regarding the fast reusability and the cost to access to space. The Falcon 9 booster has been reused 20 times but has never been subjected to the stresses of an 8 km/s reentry from LEO and the faster turnaround for the booster is 14 days. I do find that the \u201cStoke space\u201d approach with the heat shield with regenerative cooling is more sustainable if it works.Loading...Peter Cassidysays:December 1, 2024 at 3:48 amAgreed.
