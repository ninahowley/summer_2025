The play explores the cultural and historical disappearance of lesbian and gay bars, which have long served as vital gathering places for the LGBTQ+ community. These spaces have historically offered refuge, celebration and identity in a world that has often marginalized them. Written and performed by the talented members of Chocolate Rainbow Theatre Company, directed by award-winning comedian Julia Jackson, and produced by Meja Pannell-Tyehimba, this production offers an authentic, heartfelt narrative that reflects both the loss and the resilience of LGBTQ+ spaces across America. \u201cThrough \u2018Last Call at Club Vibe,\u2019 we\u2019re not just putting on a play, we\u2019re calling attention to a critical cultural shift and asking audiences to reflect on what is being lost,\u201d said Pannell-Tyehimba, in a release for the production. \u201cThese spaces are not just bars, they are community centers, safe havens and vital cultural institutions.\u201d This evocative story is brought to life by a diverse cast of performers who reflect the spirit and mission of Chocolate Rainbow Theatre Company (CRTC)\u2014artists who identify as POC, LGBTQ+AI, and their Allies. Director Julia Jackson brings her unique blend of comedy and heart to this story, offering a fresh lens for audiences to connect with the characters and themes. Jackson\u2019s accolades as a comedian and storyteller ensure this production is as entertaining as it is meaningful. \u201cLast Call at Club Vibe\u201d is made possible in part by the Vallejo Arts Fund and marks a significant cultural moment for Vallejo\u2019s performing arts scene. As gentrification, digital culture, and changing social landscapes contribute to the closure of iconic LGBTQ+ establishments, this play asks urgent questions about community, identity and the need for safe, welcoming spaces. IF YOU GO: WHAT:Last Call at Club Vibe WHEN:September 13 and 14 at 7:30 p.m., September 15 at 3 p.m. WHERE:Mira Theatre, 51 Daniels Avenue, Vallejo. TICKETS:$20-30.
