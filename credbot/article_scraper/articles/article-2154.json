Kay Ivey (R) performed a comedic skit in blackface in 1967 at Auburn University, audio tapes circling the web on Thursday reveal. \u201cShe had on a pair of blue coveralls and she had put some black paint all over her face,\u201d Ben LaRavia, then Ivey\u2019s fianc\u00e9,says in the interview. \u201cWe were acting out this skit called Cigar Butts. I cannot go into a lengthy explanation but to say the least I think this skit, it did not require a lot of talent as far as verbal talent.\u201d The performance he describes in the interview appears consistent with the ugliest core patterns of minstrel show tradition: A white audience invited to hoot with laughter at a portrayal of black people as groveling, graceless, inferior beings. Ivey\u2019s blackface role involved \u201ccrawling around on the floor looking for cigar butts\u201d and \u201ccertainly got a big reaction out of the audience,\u201d her then-fianc\u00e9 said in the interview. LaRavia chuckles as he recalls the evening. Ivey responds with a story about forgetting her lines later on in the evening\u2019s performance, chuckling as well but not saying anything further about her blackface role. The date of the pageant in question is particularly significant. The 1967 school year would have been the first time in a while that Auburn kids didn\u2019t have to wonder if a black student might see or hear what they had to say. The first black person to matriculate at the school, Harold Franklin, had left Auburn in 1966. \u201cI got tired of the crap,\u201d he told AL.com in a 2013 interview, saying the faculty seemed to block his preferred routes of study at every turn. Franklin\u2019s enrollment in January 1964 followed two separate court cases overturning the white establishment\u2019s attempts to keep black people out of the school. **Ralph Northam\u2019s neighbors shaped his views on race. Here\u2019s what they want the governor to do next.** People like to think Virginia's Eastern Shore has a nobler racial past than its neighbors can claim. It's not quite so simple. **Ralph Northam\u2019s neighbors shaped his views on race. Here\u2019s what they want the governor to do next.** People like to think Virginia's Eastern Shore has a nobler racial past than its neighbors can claim. It's not quite so simple. The interview tape comes six months after Ivey narrowly avoided the kind of scandalous re-examination of her moral character that faced Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam (D) in the winter. Photographs showing members of Ivey\u2019s sorority in blackface emerged in February, during a nationwide wave of such reveals sparked by Northam\u2019s own offensive past behavior and stubborn response to the criticism it unleashed. Opinions about the Virginia governor deeply divided the state; the gap appeared more connected to generational than racial lines, as ThinkProgress reported based on a visit to Northam\u2019s remote Eastern Shore home town. Reaction among Alabama politicians to Ivey\u2019s blackface past echo those that came in Virginia after Northam\u2019s pictures were revealed. And like her Democratic counterpart, Ivey does not appear interested in any discussion of whether or not she can be trusted to lead her state in the best interests of its black residents. One notable difference, however, is that Northam eventually appeared before reporters and cameras to talk about the whole affair. Ivey \u2014 perhaps aware that Northam nearly broke into a moonwalk in his fervor to reject the idea that blackface is a marker of racist personal prejudices \u2014 has opted for a written statement instead. It is a striking document, by turns conciliatory and minimizing of her responsibility. Throughout, she is adamant that she is no longer the sort of person who would shoe-polish her face to help college kids laugh at a perverse denigration of black people. \u201cWhile some may attempt to excuse this as acceptable behavior for a college student during the mid-1960s, that is not who I am today, and it is not what my Administration represents all these years later,\u201d she wrote. That portion of the statement engages a slippery rhetorical technique: Placing a defense of her character in the hypothetical voice of some imagined other, then moving swiftly on having neither agreed with nor condemned that argument in her own voice. State Rep. Mike Ball (R) was happier to take up the some-may-say invitation Ivey coded into her typed statement. \u201cPeople do stupid things when they are young,\u201d Ball told reporters Thursday. \u201cOne of the wonderful things about life is that we can learn and we can change over time.\u201d The governor\u2019s written statement went on to offer \u201cheartfelt apologies\u201d and a pledge to \u201cdo all I can \u2014 going forward \u2014 to help show the nation that the Alabama of today is a far cry from the Alabama of the 1960s.\u201d Multiple state legislators condemned Ivey on Thursday. \u201cThis is who she was then. It is who she is now. I have nothing for her. I don\u2019t accept her apology,\u201d state Rep. Juandalynn Givan (D) said. Givan gave special attention to Ivey\u2019s decision to release a written statement without facing cameras or supporters, while also succinctly capturing the kinds of questions the governor likely sought to avoid fielding under klieg lights. \u201cShe should have stood before the people of Alabama herself,\u201d Givan said. \u201cJust as she stood there in blackface, how many times has she said n*****? I\u2019m going to say the word. That is the question black folk need to ask themselves today.\u201d Contact Us Facebook Twitter Youtube Instagram"}
