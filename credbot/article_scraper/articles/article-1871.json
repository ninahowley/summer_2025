In three separate letters sent to Mr. Robert Malone of the IRS\u2019s Exempt Organizations and Government Entities division, AAER presents evidence that these nonprofits have engaged in practices that categorically exclude white Americans from benefits and opportunities based solely on race\u2014practices that, AAER alleges, are incompatible with longstanding public policy and Supreme Court precedent governing tax-exempt status under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7501(c)(3). According to AAER\u2019s letter, the Lagrant Foundation offers scholarships, mentorships, and career development opportunities exclusively to applicants who are African American/Black, Alaska Native/Native American, Asian American/Pacific Islander, or Hispanic/Latino. White students and professionals are excluded, in direct violation, the letter argues, of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Bob Jones University v. United States, 461 U.S. 574 (1983), which held that organizations practicing racial discrimination are not eligible for tax-exempt status. AAER also challenges the Gates Foundation\u2019s college funding initiative, the Gates Scholarship. The program provides full tuition, mentoring, and leadership development\u2014but only to individuals who identify as racial or ethnic minorities, with white students ineligible to apply. The letter to the IRS notes that these practices contradict both the IRS\u2019s own guidance and recent Supreme Court precedent from Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard (2023), in which the justices reaffirmed that \u201cracial discrimination is invidious in all contexts.\u201d Finally, AAER asserts the Creative Capital Foundation\u2019s \u201cCreative Capital Forward Fund\u201d provided up to $700,000 in grants and extensive career support solely to Asian, Black, Indigenous, and Latinx creators\u2014explicitly excluding white artists. AAER\u2019s letter asserts that this race-based exclusion also runs afoul of IRS rules and federal civil-rights laws. Across all three letters, AAER cites Bob Jones University v. United States, the IRS\u2019s Exempt Organizations Technical Guide, and multiple executive orders issued by President Trump in early 2025\u2014including Executive Order 14173, which explicitly directs federal agencies to eliminate private-sector programs that implement \u201crace- and sex-based preferences.\u201d AAER\u2019s actions follow its broader mission to eliminate racial and ethnic distinctions from American law and public policy. Edward Blum, president of AAER said, \u201cThese organizations are free to operate as they wish\u2014but not with the public subsidy that tax-exempt status provides. Racial discrimination\u2014whether in scholarships, professional development, or artistic grants\u2014violates public policy and must not be underwritten by American taxpayers.\u201d Blum added, \u201cOrganizations that discriminate based on race\u2014whether their intentions are benevolent or not\u2014are not eligible for public subsidies through the tax code. The IRS must act to uphold the law.\u201d The letters to the IRS are attached. The American Alliance for Equal Rights Home About Our Cases Tell Us Your Story Newsroom Contact Us"}
