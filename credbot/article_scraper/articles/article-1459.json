Video clips of the incident, which were posted onsocial media, show that what began as a protest quickly escalated into physical altercations. One clip shows two men physically dragging a protester out of the classroom, and another shows a man yanking and pulling a protester\u2019s head around by grabbing their keffiyeh, which is a traditional Arab headdress. Despite the Boulder Students for Justice in Palestine group saying that this incident was aviolent assaulton students, the CU Boulder Police Department submitted an arrest warrant on April 10 for the one pro-Palestine student protester they could identify, according to a police report obtained through a public records request. But the Boulder County District Attorney\u2019s office denied the arrest warrant. \u201cAfter careful consideration of the information contained in the warrant, the surveillance videos shown to me, and the conversation we had \u2026 about this case, myself and my office have determined that we will not approve the warrant,\u201d Chief Trial Deputy District Attorney Kelsey Waldorf wrote in an email to CUPD on April 11. \u201cUltimately, we think these cases are going to be highly difficult to prove to a jury because the conduct doesn\u2019t fit neatly into the criminal statutes governing this kind of conduct.\u201d Casondra Heiss, the student for whom CUPD submitted the arrest warrant, declined to comment. The two other people who reportedly entered the classroom with her remain unknown. If the warrant had been approved, CU Boulder would have \u201cutilized (it) as a template for arrest warrants\u201d for three additional students who did not enter the classroom, and for David Preedy, an outside mentor who physically assaulted multiple protesters, according to the police report. Two of the three additional students who did not enter the classroom, Max Inman and Mari Rosenfeld, havefiled a lawsuitagainst the University of Colorado, alleging free speech and due process violations after being banned from campus following a pro-Palestine protest. The proposed charge for Heiss and the additional three students was conspiracy to commit interference with staff, faculty or students of educational institutions, a Class 2 misdemeanor, according to Mueksch. CU Boulder said in a statement that the university has excluded Preedy from campus property. Preedy was an outside mentor who was visiting the class on the day of the disruption. During the incident, Preedy \u201cgrabbed\u201d and \u201cshoved\u201d one of the women protesters out of the room and then \u201cchased \u2026 down\u201d the other protesters to forcibly remove their face and head coverings, according to the police report. Peruniversity policy, campus exclusions may be executed to ensure the safety and well-being of the campus community. CU Boulder spokesperson Nicole Mueksch said criminal charges are not required to execute a campus exclusion. \u201cPreedy mentioned that he was also fearful that they were going to harm the people in the classroom so he jumped up and forced them out of the classroom,\u201d according to the police report. \u201c\u2026 Preedy explained to me that he was afraid they may try and harm other people and that\u2019s why he chased them down and tried to pull their masks off.\u201d Mueksch said the proposed charge for Preedy was harassment, a Class 1 misdemeanor. Preedy could not be reached for comment. CU Boulder releaseda statementon Monday saying the university had consulted with the Boulder County District Attorney\u2019s office after reviewing the evidence in the investigation of the incident. \u201cAfter a careful evaluation, and under the consideration that the standard for filing criminal charges requires that there be a reasonable likelihood of conviction, the agencies determined that criminal charges would not be filed,\u201d according to aCU Boulder statement. CU Boulder said it cannot disclose actions involving students due to federal law, noting, however, that all students are subject to the CU Boulder Student Code of Conduct. Any student found responsible for violating the Student Code of Conduct will be subject to appropriate sanctions, the statement read. \u201cThe safety of all students, faculty, staff and visitors at CU Boulder remains a top priority, and the university is committed to protecting public safety on campus while also supporting free speech that does not violate laws or university policies,\u201d according to the statement. \u201cCUPD appreciates the Boulder County District Attorney\u2019s support in evaluating this case.\u201d The professor of the class was Andrew Meyer, according to the police report. Despite allegations by the Boulder Students for Justice in Palestine group that the professor had \u201cviolently assaulted\u201d the protesting students, Meyer was listed as a witness on the police report, not a suspect. The university said there was no evidence that the instructor of the class broke any laws in the April 2 incident. At the time of the disruption, Meyer was teaching \u201ca class on matters involving defense security for the government,\u201d according to the police report. Meyer reported to the police that he \u201cimmediately was terrified\u201d because the people who entered the classroom were wearing all black and were covered by face masks, so he felt that they \u201cmay have had weapons and malicious intent\u201d to harm him and his students. Meyer could not be reached for a comment. Boulder Students for Justice in Palestine, which is not affiliated with CU Boulder, called on the university to issue a public condemnation of the assault and grant the students amnesty from any student conduct charges. \u201cIn (Monday\u2019s) statement, CU Boulder does not condemn the violence \u2026,\u201d the group wrote in an email to the Daily Camera on Tuesday. \u201cIn previous official remarks, the university equated physical violence to a policy violation for students disrupting a class. \u2026 Any CU student employee will know that a part of our training is learning to de-escalate situations with students, even if we disagree with them. This professor, like any other CU employee, had an obligation to at the very least de-escalate the situation. \u2026 This university, where classroom disruptions are routine as part of the induction process for fraternities, has only taken a clear stance against disruption when students are speaking out against their university taking an active part in genocide.\u201d Boulder Students for Justice in Palestine was placed in bad standing by the university in October followingreported policy violations. The group remains active but unaffiliated with CU Boulder. **Share this:** Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Facebook Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)Reddit Click to share
