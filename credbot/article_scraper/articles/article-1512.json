This decision follows the passage of Senate Bill 449 during the 2024 Georgia Legislative Session, which amended the Official Code of Georgia to introduce new, streamlined licensure pathways for qualified military medics, medical technicians, and corpsmen. The new program at CGTC is designed to recognize the service and extensive healthcare experience of military medical personnel by offering a bridge between military and civilian healthcare careers. With GBON\u2019s guidance, and collaboration with the Department of Veterans Services, this initiative builds on military medical training and allows for career growth after re-entering the civilian sector. **Email newsletter signup** The program provides the additional education required to prepare participants for the responsibilities and scope of practice of a Licensed Practical Nurse in Georgia.
