Attentive listeners will notice that this episode is about a book but isn\u2019t an author interview. That\u2019s because it\u2019s the first in a new occasional series of episodes that will be dedicated to books by conservative writers that we think are important\u2014whether because a book articulates the right\u2019s approach to an issue or problem in an especially revealing way, influenced or galvanized the conservative movement when it was published, or, with the benefit of hindsight, has proven to be prescient about where the right, and perhaps the country, were heading. Many of these books will be from decades past, but our first selection is more recent: Christopher Caldwell\u2019s 2020 broadside against the 1964 Civil Rights Act and what it wrought,The Age of Entitlement: America Since the Sixties. Caldwell argues that the apparatus created by civil rights legislation and the federal courts in the 1960s amounted to a new, second constitution that displaced the one Americans had lived under since the founding, one that jettisoned traditional liberties like freedom of association and replaced democratic self-government with rule by bureaucrats, lawyers, and judges. Who has access to these new levers of power? Not the working-class whites who are neither a favored racial or ethnic minority\u2014a person of color\u2014nor a member of the progressive elite who preside over the new regime. Much ofThe Age of Entitlementis dedicated to tracing the effects of civil rights legislation when it comes to the causes that arose in its wake: feminism, immigrant rights, gay marriage, and more. But the book is equally a brutal examination of the legacy of the Baby Boom generation (and, by extension, Ronald Reagan, whose presidency they powered), that most \u201centitled\u201d of generations, whom Caldwell deplores for wanting to have their cake and eat it too. Boomers, in Caldwell\u2019s telling, refused to straightforwardly reject the second constitution and its distributional demands, while also insisting petulantly, again and again, on having their taxes cut. We explore these topics and more, and end with a discussion of where Caldwell leaves the reader\u2014and where we\u2019re at now, in light of the challenge he poses to both conservatives and the left.
