It\u2019s been this way for years, and keeps getting worse and worse. Million-dollar decisions are driven by data loaded up with fraudulent respondents and AI-generated answers. Just as bad, even consumers who want to answer your questions truthfully are being offered surveys so badly designed that they tune out and say whatever they need just to make it end. Agencies talk about their fraud-prevention tools, but they\u2019re far from perfect, and more importantly, they can\u2019t do anything about all the bad data that\u2019s being created byrealrespondents who are faced withterriblequestions that they just can\u2019t answer \u2014 even if they want to. **You can\u2019t make good decisions with bad data.** 15-20 minute surveys areproducing data you can\u2019t trust. You\u2019re paying people pennies and asking them questions they can\u2019t possibly answer, creating data that \u2014 even if it were accurate \u2014 would produce no real learning. Asking 2 dozen questions about each of 3 dozen brands \u2014 even ones the respondent has barely heard of before \u2014 is not good practice: it\u2019srespondent abuse. Abused respondents transform from consumers with strong opinions into trapped research subjects who will deny knowing even the brands they love \u2014 because they realize each time they click \u201cfamiliar,\u201d they\u2019re going to get another 30 questions about something they\u2019ve barely even heard of. You\u2019re asking head-scratchers about how likely people are to recommend banks, telephone carriers, or cat foods to friends, or how close they feel to various brands, or making them rank a dozen TVs by how much each makes them feel 2 dozen emotions.People just don\u2019t think about brands this way. Other projects ask questions in impenetrable industry jargon, or run respondents through nightmare grids or endless picklists with hundreds of unordered choices. The best sales tool SurveyUSA could possibly design is already out there \u2014 go join a panel or two and take a handful of surveys. If you think we\u2019re exaggerating, you clearly haven\u2019t done this in a while. **Better questions. Better answers.
