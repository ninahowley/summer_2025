Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Copy LinkLink Copied Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Copy LinkLink Copied The 2025 BET Awards seem to be the gift that keeps on giving.Not only has B2Kannounced a 2026 reunion tour following their performance during the \u201c106 & Park\u201d opening segment of the show, but it also seems like we might have some beef brewing between two of the sports world\u2019s most popular figures: world champion boxer Claressa Shields and WNBA superstar Angel Reese. Reese won the 2025 \u201cSportswoman of the Year\u201d award at this year\u2019s BET Awards, and it would seem that Shields was none too happy about it. It\u2019s hard to tell if Shields was unhappy that she lost or if she was unhappy that she lost to Reese, who also beat out a quite crowded field that included Dawn Staley, A\u2019ja Wilson, Sha\u2019Carri Richardson, Simone Biles, Flau\u2019Jae Johnson, Coco Gauff, and Juju Watkins. Still don\u2019t know how I didn\u2019t win the Sportswoman of the Year for the@BETAwardsbut Congrats to Angel Reese and all the other Nominees \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f I just thought accolades mattered. In a post on X, Shields said, \u201cI don\u2019t know how I didn\u2019t win the Sportswoman of the Year for the BET Awards but congrats to Angel Reese and all the other nominees. I just thought accolades mattered.\u201d As a point of note, Shields is a 2-time Olympic champion and, according to her X profile, a 17-time world champion and 4-time undisputed champ. Inarguably, she\u2019s as dominant in her sport as a person can be. Reese also has many accolades under her belt, including both a 2023 NCAA women\u2019s basketball championship and that tournament\u2019s \u201cMost Outstanding Player\u201d award, among a litany of other accomplishments across the college and, now, the WNBA world. When folks challenged Shields about Reese, indeed, also having accomplishments and accolades, Shields doubled down. While acknowledging that Reese does have accolades, she pushed back. \u201cYes she does but who has more accolades? More success in their field\u2026,\u201d she asked in a response post. After continued pushback and allegations that she was messy and a sore loser,Shields kept it real. Ain\u2019t nobody saying Angel Reese don\u2019t have accolades or she not good\u2026. I\u2019m saying I thought the person with \u201cTHE MOST\u201d accolades & accomplishments would win the Award. I\u2019m team Angel Reese! \u201cAin\u2019t nobody saying Angel Reese don\u2019t have accolades or she not good\u2026I\u2019m saying I thought the person with the \u201cMOST\u201d accolades & accomplishments would win the awards. I\u2019m team Angel Reese.\u201d Shields might be team Angel Reese (many are) and having a public moment of frustration. Maybe she thought she was a shoo-in for the award, though one has to wonder if she would feel the same if Simone Biles or A\u2019ja Wilson won. That, we\u2019ll never know. Hopefully, this doesn\u2019t become a social media mess with a back-and-forth between the two women. The world is better when Shields and Reese are just two women doing big things in their respective fields, bigging one another up without the extra sauce on it.
