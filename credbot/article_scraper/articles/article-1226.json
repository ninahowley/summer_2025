The Science, Climate, and Statistics of Population Growth** When the editors of the popular United Kingdom-based publicationThe Guardiandecided to publishan articlewith the title, \u201cWant to fight climate change? Have fewer children,\u201d they had to know what was coming. The article, written by Damian Carrington, does not castigate those who want to have children, nor does it suggest that children are a force for ill. Rather, Carrington presents data which suggests that in order to stave off the worst impacts of climate change, humans should think aboutglobal populationand the effect of bring a child into the world on our increasingly hot world. Carrington recommends no particular policy, nor does he advocate anything like China\u2019s once-infamous One Child Policy. Ultimately, Carrington\u2019s aim is to inform the public of the environmental externalities of having children. Little should be controversial about that. Yet based on the response to Carrington\u2019s article, he might as well have been calling for eugenics, if not outright extinction. \u201cI\u2019ll have exactly the number of children I want to have kthxbi,\u201d wrote Twitter user@gupta_jamesin response toThe Guardian\u2018s initial Tweeting out of the article. No better article sums up the forced extremities of the population debate better than this Tweet by author Jill Filipovic: Filipovic mishandles both the title and substance of Carrington\u2019s argument. His point is not that children in of themselves are a scourge on the earth, an \u201cirresponsible\u201d creation on the part of thoughtless parents. Carrington simply wants parents to actually consider how their behavior affects the earth, a planet where their children will ideally live long and happy lives. Two days after her initial Tweet, Filipovicadmittedto her Tweet\u2019s being \u201cpoorly phrased,\u201d but stood by the claims made by Carrington in the article. Unfortunately for Filipovic, her mea culpa came well after being flooded with responses like these: Through her \u201cpoorly phrased\u201d Tweet, Filipovic undoubtedly opened herself up to replies like these, and many other far less charitable, and often sexist ones. Yet although the wording of Filipovic\u2019s Tweet deserves criticism, the issue of population ethics shouldn\u2019t devolve into a false dichotomy either. Filipovic\u2019s Tweet, in this way, serves as synecdoche for the way all too many population debates go down: you\u2019re either staunchly anti-kid, or you think that any attempt at balancing Earth\u2019s massive population is tantamount to someone having your kids whacked. Both of these extremes muddy a debate that\u2019s not only important, but necessary. There is no doubt that having children is a fundamental part to life. Child-rearing brings meaning, happiness, and fulfillment for people around the globe. And, of course, at the basic biological level, humans like any species seek to propagate themselves, and as such no one, not even the most dictatorial of regimes, will ever stop the wonderful act that is bringing a child into the world. But here\u2019s the thing:population ethics, a growing field in both philosophy and science, doesn\u2019t negate the importance of children.Unless one is a kind of population nihilist \u2013 a fringe view, should it exist \u2013 \u201cpopulation ethics\u201d simply means finding ways to manage Earth\u2019s population such that all of those living on Earth can enjoy the earth safely and healthfully. This area of study, at its best, never demands the elimination of children (which, by extension, would be an elimination of the species), but rather looks for ways to mitigate the externalities posed by the large population that occupies the Earth, and also seeks means that incentivize a healthier, steadier population growth without curtailing rights in the way that policies like China\u2019s One Child Policy did. In order to responsibly conduct a discussion about the size of Earth\u2019s population and its relationship to larger issues like climate change, we first must understand the basic science behind how a large population relates to the Earth, as well as how it relates to the ways in which societies have arranged themselves across the globe. Talking this out in no way means we are on the road to strict population controls, forced sterilization, or a total embrace of Malthusian philosophy. It does mean, however, that we must reckon with the fact that the amount of people on Earth does affect how the Earth operates. The sooner we understand that, the better informed we will be in preparing the planet for the generations to come. Earth\u2019s Population: Numbers and Data First, the big number:7.4 billion, currently the estimated number of human beings living on Earth according to theUS Census Bureau. As of 2017, the countries contributing the most to that population are: China\u2013 1.3 billion India \u2013 1.2. billion The United States \u2013 326 million Indonesia \u2013 260 million Brazil \u2013 207 million Pakistan \u2013 204 million Nigeria \u2013 190 million Bangladesh \u2013 157 million Russia \u2013 142 million Japan \u2013 126 million This figure ofEarth\u2019s populationimpresses on its own, but its magnitude becomes even more considerable when one takes into account how the Earth got to that number in a matter of just over 50 years. In just a half a century, the Earth more than doubled its population, a hefty doubling given that the starting point was just north of three billion. However, it\u2019s worth noting that the steady upward climb of the graph above can make it easy to miss an important statistic. In an article forSlate, Jeff Wisepoints outthat it took 13 years for global population to hit the 7 billion mark, one year longer than it took to reach 6 billion. Prior to that, the pace was one of increasingly short timespans: it took 123 years to reach 2 billion, 33 years to reach 3 billion, 14 to reach 4 billion, and 13 to reach 5 billion. Wise maintains that the slightly longer time it took to reach 7 billion foreshadows a future of population decline, not growth, a conclusion that remains in dispute \u2014 more on that later. The countries with the largest populations are not always the countries with the fastest growing populations, which at its base is the main concern of writers like Carrington. When it comes to the effects of a large population on climate change, it\u2019s population boom \u2014 not simply the existence of a large population in general \u2014 that concerns researchers. The United Nations Population Division, based on a five year timespan from 2010-2015,foundthe following data regarding how population is distributed. The categories below reflect the ten countries with the highest population growth (\u201cPopulation Boom\u201d), the five countries with the lowest growth (\u201cPopulation Decline\u201d), and a small sample of major Western countries that have begun spreading concerns about overpopulation (\u201cWestern Countries\u201d). The percentages can be read as: \u201cThe population of this country grew/declined by X percent between 2010-15.\u201d Qatar: 6.65% Oman: 6.45% Lebanon: 5.99% Kuwait: 5.44% Jordan: 4.86% Equatorial Guinea: 4.24% Niger: 3.84% Angola: 3.52% Uganda: 3.37% Democratic Republic of the Congo: 3.33% Syrian Arab Republic: -2.30% Wallis and Futuna Islands: -2.13% Andorra: -1.59% Georgia: -1.37% Lithuania: -1.27% The United States: .72% The United Kingdom: .65% Canada: 1.02% Germany: .20% France: .45% In looking at these sets of figures, something perplexes. Many of the worries about population growth are expressed by people in Western liberal democracies, such as the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, among others. Yet none of these countries show up either in the list of booming or receding populations. By and large, the countries fretting the most about climbing population statistics themselves contribute little to that climb. As a whole, Europe barely managed to eke out any population growth between 2010-2015, with just a .10% increase. In the extensive Excel data sheet provided by the UN Population Division, Europe ranks just seven countries above the line below which population growth starts dipping into negative numbers. A close analysis of the countries experiencing population booms reveals why it is, among many reasons, that debates about population become so fraught, so quickly. Look back to the countries with the top ten fastest growing populations: numbers one through five are all in the Middle East, and African countries make up six through ten. With these statistics in mind, it requires little imagination to see how debates over population can in seconds morph into clashes of civilization. The recently elected French president Emmanuel Macron got himself into hot water whenhe accused Africaof having a \u201ccivilization problem\u201d due in part to the way in which the women in the continent (which, as too many Westerners do, he speaks of as a country) have \u201cseven or eight kids.\u201d Datacollectedby the World Bank corroborates Macron\u2019s generalization, but that shouldn\u2019t give him any confidence for several reasons. The countries with the ten highest birthrates on a child-per-woman basis are: \u201cFertility rate, total (births per woman)\u201dbyWorld Bankis licensed underCC BY-4.0 All of these but Timor, a Southeast Asian island nation, are located in Africa. Yet not even these numbers give Macron\u2019s ill-thought statement any credence. First, it\u2019s important to consider the trends of these World Bank numbers, indicated by the mini-graph to the right of the number. Even with rather high birthrates, none of these countries\u2019 numbers show upward trends \u2014 just the opposite, in fact. The decline in Niger\u2019s birth rate stands out less than, say, the Democratic Republic of the Congo\u2019s (DRC), but it\u2019s there. Just like any country, the wide-ranging mass of countries Macron simply labels \u201cAfrica\u201d experiences ups and downs. Trends come and go. It could well happen that birth rates for these countries decline even more precipitously in the years to come. Second, and more importantly, the wording of Macron\u2019s statement indicates a cultural rather than statistical judgment. He did not say, \u201cThe high population rates in African countries will prove unsustainable in the long run.\u201d He judged African culture as inferior on the basis of how many children are born in the African continent. That\u2019s neither science nor statistics. That\u2019s racism. Problematic cultural judgments aside, Macron\u2019s comments also expose the single most common misunderstanding of how population operates within the world, especially as it relates to the rising temperatures of the Earth\u2019s climate. When it comes to population, sheer number of people is not enough. Population: Not Just a Number Alone The varied angry responses toThe Guardian\u2019spopulation article indicate, as is the case with many \u201chot takes,\u201d that people read the headline without actually reading the text of the article. Carrington cites numerous data which establishes the inherent link between consumption and population. There\u2019s no scientific, hard-and-fast number of people after which life on Earth becomes unsustainable. Were the entire world to eschew the machinery of global capitalism and return to a regionally-focused, agrarian barter system, CO2 emissions could easily vanish or at the very least substantially decrease over the period of a couple of years. Overpopulation becomes a concern when one takes into account the amount of people on Earth and factors in how much these people consume on average. Speaking about this issueto the BBC, David Satterthwaite of the International Institute for Environment and Development in London quotes Gandhi: \u201cThe world has enough for everyone\u2019s need, but not enough for everyone\u2019s greed.\u201d Considering the wide range of living standards around the world, it should come as no surprise that some countries are more guilty than others of overconsumption. Carrington points out that the average American individual consumes over 40 times the emissions created by people in Bangladesh, a figure that is undoubtedly higher when one compares America to small countries. The inextricability of individuals with their rates of consumption means that the problem of overpopulation requires an elaborate calculation. Individuals must be understood relative to the country they live in. This means factoring in the average energy consumption for citizens of a country, how much they drive and fly, and so on. When you look at the numbers provided by the United States\u2019 Energy Information Administration, a stark picture manifests. The four graphs below break down the top consumers of the main sources of energy used in the world: (Source:Energy Information Administration) Although slight variations exist in these lists, a common feature unites them: none of them are countries with booming populations. In fact, many are the North American and European countries whose populations continue to shrink. But if one just looked to the numbers of people in trying to ascertain the likelihood of overpopulation, she\u2019d be fooled by the low birth rates in Western countries. The charts above show that even if Western populations are tiny, they imbibe enough oil, gas, and coal to make their populations weigh a lot heavier on the Earth. The aforementioned statistic of Carrington\u2019s shows that a Bangladeshi family could consist of 20 people, and it would still only consume half of what a single American citizen outputs into the atmosphere. Sometimes a number is more than just itself. Talking about population means thinking about consumption.There is no getting around it. The seeming inverse correlation between a country\u2019s consumption and population rates seen in the data above suggests something more complex than much of the popular discourse about overpopulation lets on. Currently, the interrelationship between population and consumption shows the latter, not the former, winning out \u2014 though that\u2019s not to say the former is of no concern. Climate Change: The Individual and the Corporation Given the stakes of global climate change \u2014 which,bymostaccounts, gets worse by the day \u2014 individuals can easily feel the weight of what can be called the Smokey the Bear View of Moral Obligations. Just as that famous woodland bear tells campers and hikers, \u201cOnlyyoucan prevent forest fires!\u201d, people struggling under the weight of certain climate doom get the sense that everything hinges on their personal choices: ditching a gas-guzzler for a hybrid, composting anything that will let itself turn to dirt, bringing reusable bags to the grocery store rather than ponying up for plastic, the list goes on. Wanting to do better by the environment is commendable, and certainly necessary. But culpability for climate change rests on no one person, country, or corporation. The world is where it is now because of incalculable numbers of decisions over the course of centuries, largely those beginning with industrialization in the West. But if culpability is hard to assess, we can at least identify where the greatest environmental damage comes from \u2014 and it\u2019s not individuals choosing to fill up their gas tank every now and then. When it comes to emissions, 90 companiesaccount for about two thirdsof the dangerous pollutants clouding our air. Writing for the Union of Concerned Scientists, Aaron Huertaarguesfor a distinction between industrial structures and human activities. The two are related, but the former, not the latter, creates deleterious externalities that are eroding the climate situation of Earth. The behavior of a coal mining company far outstrips the damage an individual could do by letting his air conditioning run for longer than normal. Culpability for climate change thus manifests in degrees, not in binary \u201cguilty/not guilty\u201d proclamations. Insofar as all humans have a vested interest in preserving the Earth and making it a hospitable place, the burden of ameliorating climate change falls on us all, but it weighs differently upon each of us. A family of seven in the DRC may contribute to climate change, but its slightly larger family size is an ant compared to the elephant of Exxon Mobil\u2019s global oil extraction operation when it comes to climate damage. Overpopulation: Not a Problem After All? If overpopulation is understood as, \u201cThere are just too many people for this Earth,\u201d then no, it is not an issue. There is no magic number after which life on Earth descends into inhospitable madness. The notion of seven billion people can leave one dumbfounded simply by its sheer magnitude, but Earth is a capacious place. Nevertheless, humanity stands at a critical juncture. And while most of the harm visited upon the climate roots itself in systemic, corporate behavior rather than individual choices, population still matters in the end. Huerta\u2019s distinction between industrial structures and individual activities belies that the latter feeds the former; they exist in a symbiotic relationship. Certainly, as Huerta points out, there are cases where what appear to be human activities come about as a result of corporate manipulation: Americans do love junk food above all else, but the propagation of that desire might have less to do with an innate belief about the deliciousness of Doritos (Huerta\u2019s example) and more to do with how US farm subsidies make it cheaper to grow the products that go into Doritos rather than healthy vegetables and fruit. Moreover, even if one wanted to entirely eliminate her carbon footprint, suppose she also wanted to advance in corporate America: how could she expect to do so without cars (which require fuel), planes (which require fuel), and computers and phones (which use electricity, typically sourced from coal)? No matter how one tries to dodge it, the machine has long been in place, and it only grows in power by the day. Even the workarounds, like electric cars and hybrids, still rely on the status quo electric grids, which \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 heavily contribute to pollution. In the face of this massive hurdle, it\u2019s not simply enough to say, \u201cWell, the issue is really consumption, so we can forget about population and focus on consuming better.\u201d Until the world fundamentally reorders itself so as to stave off the worst impacts of climate change, the system remains. Knowing that, it\u2019s prudent to ensure that we don\u2019t trick ourselves into thinking the inputs \u2014 in this case, people, who consume \u2014 are irrelevant to the outputs. The solutions to this issue require care for the rights of individuals and close attention to the data. But the conversations need to be had, and they need to happen in a way conducive to good debate, not in simple-minded Twitter disputes whose only virtue is showing the foolishness of a discourse that only knows extreme polarity. Carrington\u2019s article matters for how it re-orients the discussion to the role of population in a still-growing world of seven billion people. Anyone claiming that there\u2019s just too many people doesn\u2019t understand the gravity of what\u2019s going on, but so too does anyone thinking that population doesn\u2019t have anything to do with it. People, consumption, corporations: they\u2019re all cogs in the machine that\u2019s gotten the world to where it is: on the brink of environmental disaster. \u2190 Previous post Next post \u2192 **Related Posts** Important Strategies To Help Healthcare Providers Support Patients With Diabetes Studying The Link Between Increased BMI And Late-Onset Preeclampsia In Pregnant Women A Bacterial Cell Imaging Method Using CRISPR And Microfluidics B. infantis Reduces Key Markers Of Intestinal Inflammation In Infants Epigenetic Changes In Multiple Sclerosis \u2013 Studied In Twins Did You Know Math Can Help Us Learn How Diseases Work? \u00a9 2024 Science Trends LLC.
