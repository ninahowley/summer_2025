Those fires still burn today in places on the Muscogee Reservation.By the Fire We CarryBy Rebecca Nagle352 pages, hardcover: $30Harper, 2024.InBy the Fire We Carry, Cherokee journalist Rebecca Nagle documents the interwoven stories of tribal land dispossession, forced removal, a murder in a small tribal community, her own family history and three recent and consequential Supreme Court decisions about tribal jurisdiction over lands in Oklahoma. Two of them,Murphy v. OklahomaandMcGirt v. Oklahoma,centered on crimes on land that the state of Oklahoma argued was no longer part of the Muscogee and Cherokee Nations\u2019 respective reservations. In both cases, the Supreme Court upheld the tribes\u2019 arguments in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. But shortly after cameOklahoma v. Castro-Huerta, in which the Supreme Court sidestepped a century of federal Indian law and gave states jurisdiction to prosecute crimes on tribal lands when the perpetrator was non-Native and the victim was Native. The connections Nagle makes span generations and offer insight into our current political turmoil, at a time when a second Trump administration is testing the limits of executive authority and the law.In a conversation withHigh Country News, Nagle discusses how the U.S. still wields its power of empire, what impact the Trump administration could have on tribal sovereignty, and the enduring weight of history.This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.High Country News:In this book, you don\u2019t just focus on the 20-year histories of these three Supreme Court cases but also tell the stories of the Muscogee and Cherokee nations before the U.S. existed. Why did you decide to take such a long view?Rebecca Nagle:One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present. I also wanted people to get a sense of how history repeats itself, and how things like a lie that tribal land is lawless get used over and over again, or the excuse that, \u201cOh,thisis actually what\u2019s best for Native people.\u201d I wanted people to be able to see and identify those patterns.One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present.When I found out about theMcGirtdecision and saw the implications that my tribe\u2019s reservation would be recognized again, it was a really overwhelming emotion of relief, of joy, but there was also a lot of sadness, because I knew how much my ancestors, and Cherokee ancestors in general, had sacrificed to reach this moment. I think that a lot of other tribal citizens felt that the day that we were celebrating the Supreme Court decision. I think we all felt that weight of history. And I wanted the reader to feel that weight of history \u2014 to understand this isn\u2019t a simple story of, \u201cYay, the tribes won!\u201d There\u2019s a lot that\u2019s implicated in that victory and a lot that was lost for that rare legal victory to happen.HCN:In the book you hold multiple difficult truths at once, like how George Jacobs\u2019 death \u2014 which caused so much pain for his community \u2014 was the origin of the Murphy case and also resulted in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. Similarly, the truth of your ancestor, John Ridge, who signed a treaty that resulted in forced removal of the Cherokee people. It was against their wishes, and also what he thought he had to do to save his nation. How did you navigate that? It can be so easy to collapse these tensions to make for a simpler narrative.RN:Absolutely. As a journalist, my North Star is the truth. And I think the truth is complicated. I don\u2019t think we can tell the whole story of theMcGirtvictory without talking about the crimes and the tragedy that it originated in. And I think the same is true for my ancestors. I was sort of raised to think one thing, but I went back through the historical records and really tried to look at it for what it was. There\u2019s a lot that we can learn from the desperation of my ancestors and their decision to sign that treaty. We can learn just how violent U.S. policy was at that time, that they would make a decision like that. There\u2019s a cultural impulse to tell stories where there are clear heroes and clear villains, and victories likeMcGirtcome from a good place, and things are clean-cut. I think that history is actually quite messy. I wanted a book that reflected that reality.Credit:Lauren CrowHCN:In the aftermath of the McGirt decision, the state of Oklahoma pushed a narrative of chaos and disruption in the criminal justice system, which some national outlets then repeated without much discernment. Can you talk about the role of the media \u2014 including the lack of Indigenous representation in newsrooms \u2014 and how that shapes the public\u2019s understanding of things like tribal sovereignty?RN:I think that it\u2019s a really big hindrance to our rights as Indigenous nations and to our sovereignty. Less than a fraction of a percent of the people staffing newsrooms are Native. Coverage of Indigenous issues very often fails to meet the standards of journalism. It doesn\u2019t have context, or a depth of knowledge of what\u2019s going on. They send reporters who\u2019ve never been on a reservation to do reporting about criminal justice on tribal land. It creates an environment where you can tell lies about tribes, and people will think that it\u2019s true.And unfortunately, that\u2019s what happened. In the wake ofMcGirt, (Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, R) made some very bold and outlandish claims about the number of criminal cases that could be prosecuted moving forward. I did some digging around with a fellow reporter, Allison Herrera, and Oklahoma\u2019s claims fell apart completely. But they were still repeated and cited by prominent outlets like theWashington PostandThe Wall Street Journal.Oklahoma then cited those articles in their briefs, and some of that inaccurate information was actually in the (Castro-Huerta) Supreme Court decision. And so it was this tornado of disinformation that made it all the way up to the Supreme Court. Normally, we think that theWashington Postis a check on bad information, but not when it comes to tribes, which should be an embarrassment for them.HCN:We\u2019re in a moment of major law and policy change under a new administration.

And I think the treatment of Indigenous nations is a glaring example of that, because we\u2019ve never had any kind of constitutional amendment or reform to change those laws and to change those policies. To dispossess Indigenous people of their land, the U.S. government gave itself a lot of power over people who are not U.S. citizens. That power of empire is embedded in our Constitution, because our country wanted to take Indigenous land. We still see it manifested in deportation and shutting down asylum and separating families at the border and banning Muslims from entering our country.

A lot of tribal programs, whether it\u2019s (the Indian Health Service) or tribal courts, tribal law enforcement, rely on federal dollars. There\u2019s a lot specifically at stake for tribes under Trump. The remaking of the federal judiciary has a profound impact on tribes, because our cases are federal; they don\u2019t go through state court. And, unfortunately, the courts \u2014 dating back to before Trump \u2014 have not been reliable sources for justice for tribes. Even when the law is clearly on the tribe\u2019s side, courts have a very bad habit of bending and breaking the rules to satisfy the state or non-Native residents. One of the things that\u2019s really shocked me is how often our government institutions ignore the law when it comes to tribes and how hard tribes have to fight for just the law to be followed.

Smith, High Country News <br />March 25, 2025</p> <p class=\"has-drop-cap\">During the forced<strong> </strong>removal of Muscogee (Creek) people from their ancestral lands in the Southeastern U.S., tribal members carried the embers and ashes of their town fires with them, determined to re-establish the flames in the new communities they planned to build in what\u2019s now known as Oklahoma. Those fires still burn today in places on the Muscogee Reservation.</p> <div class=\"wp-block-group alignright\"> <!-- RTT removed image (333291) --> <p class=\"has-text-align-left\"><em><em>By the Fire We Carry</em> </em><br />By Rebecca Nagle<br />352 pages, hardcover: $30<br />Harper, 2024.</p> </p></div> <p>In <em>By the Fire We Carry</em>, Cherokee journalist Rebecca Nagle documents the interwoven stories of tribal land dispossession, forced removal, a murder in a small tribal community, her own family history and three recent and consequential Supreme Court decisions about tribal jurisdiction over lands in Oklahoma. Two of them, <em>Murphy v. Oklahoma</em> and <em>McGirt v. Oklahoma, </em>centered on crimes on land that the state of Oklahoma argued was no longer part of the Muscogee and Cherokee Nations\u2019 respective reservations. In both cases, the Supreme Court upheld the tribes\u2019 arguments in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. But shortly after came <em>Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta</em>, in which the Supreme Court sidestepped a century of federal Indian law and gave states jurisdiction to prosecute crimes on tribal lands when the perpetrator was non-Native and the victim was Native. The connections Nagle makes span generations and offer insight into our current political turmoil, at a time when a second Trump administration is testing the limits of executive authority and the law.</p> <p>In a conversation with <em>High Country News</em>, Nagle discusses how the U.S. still wields its power of empire, what impact the Trump administration could have on tribal sovereignty, and the enduring weight of history.</p> <p><em>This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p> <p><strong><em>High Country News</em></strong>: <strong>In this book, you don\u2019t just focus on the 20-year histories of these three Supreme Court cases but also tell the stories of the Muscogee and Cherokee nations before the U.S. existed. Why did you decide to take such a long view?</strong></p> <p><strong>Rebecca Nagle:</strong> One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present. I also wanted people to get a sense of how history repeats itself, and how things like a lie that tribal land is lawless get used over and over again, or the excuse that, \u201cOh, <em>this</em> is actually what\u2019s best for Native people.\u201d I wanted people to be able to see and identify those patterns.&nbsp;</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present.</p> </blockquote> <p>When I found out about the <em>McGirt</em> decision and saw the implications that my tribe\u2019s reservation would be recognized again, it was a really overwhelming emotion of relief, of joy, but there was also a lot of sadness, because I knew how much my ancestors, and Cherokee ancestors in general, had sacrificed to reach this moment. I think that a lot of other tribal citizens felt that the day that we were celebrating the Supreme Court decision. I think we all felt that weight of history.

And I think the truth is complicated. I don\u2019t think we can tell the whole story of the <em>McGirt</em> victory without talking about the crimes and the tragedy that it originated in. And I think the same is true for my ancestors. I was sort of raised to think one thing, but I went back through the historical records and really tried to look at it for what it was. There\u2019s a lot that we can learn from the desperation of my ancestors and their decision to sign that treaty. We can learn just how violent U.S. policy was at that time, that they would make a decision like that. There\u2019s a cultural impulse to tell stories where there are clear heroes and clear villains, and victories like <em>McGirt</em> come from a good place, and things are clean-cut. I think that history is actually quite messy.

Smith, High Country NewsMarch 25, 2025<h1>Rebecca Nagle considers Supreme Court wins and what\u2019s at stake for tribes under Trump</h1> <p class=\"byline\">by Anna V. Smith, High Country News <br />March 25, 2025</p> <p class=\"has-drop-cap\">During the forced<strong> </strong>removal of Muscogee (Creek) people from their ancestral lands in the Southeastern U.S., tribal members carried the embers and ashes of their town fires with them, determined to re-establish the flames in the new communities they planned to build in what\u2019s now known as Oklahoma. Those fires still burn today in places on the Muscogee Reservation.</p> <div class=\"wp-block-group alignright\"> <!-- RTT removed image (333291) --> <p class=\"has-text-align-left\"><em><em>By the Fire We Carry</em> </em><br />By Rebecca Nagle<br />352 pages, hardcover: $30<br />Harper, 2024.</p> </p></div> <p>In <em>By the Fire We Carry</em>, Cherokee journalist Rebecca Nagle documents the interwoven stories of tribal land dispossession, forced removal, a murder in a small tribal community, her own family history and three recent and consequential Supreme Court decisions about tribal jurisdiction over lands in Oklahoma. Two of them, <em>Murphy v. Oklahoma</em> and <em>McGirt v. Oklahoma, </em>centered on crimes on land that the state of Oklahoma argued was no longer part of the Muscogee and Cherokee Nations\u2019 respective reservations. In both cases, the Supreme Court upheld the tribes\u2019 arguments in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. But shortly after came <em>Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta</em>, in which the Supreme Court sidestepped a century of federal Indian law and gave states jurisdiction to prosecute crimes on tribal lands when the perpetrator was non-Native and the victim was Native. The connections Nagle makes span generations and offer insight into our current political turmoil, at a time when a second Trump administration is testing the limits of executive authority and the law.</p> <p>In a conversation with <em>High Country News</em>, Nagle discusses how the U.S. still wields its power of empire, what impact the Trump administration could have on tribal sovereignty, and the enduring weight of history.</p> <p><em>This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p> <p><strong><em>High Country News</em></strong>: <strong>In this book, you don\u2019t just focus on the 20-year histories of these three Supreme Court cases but also tell the stories of the Muscogee and Cherokee nations before the U.S. existed.

Why did you decide to take such a long view?Rebecca Nagle:One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present. I also wanted people to get a sense of how history repeats itself, and how things like a lie that tribal land is lawless get used over and over again, or the excuse that, \u201cOh,thisis actually what\u2019s best for Native people.\u201d I wanted people to be able to see and identify those patterns.One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present.When I found out about theMcGirtdecision and saw the implications that my tribe\u2019s reservation would be recognized again, it was a really overwhelming emotion of relief, of joy, but there was also a lot of sadness, because I knew how much my ancestors, and Cherokee ancestors in general, had sacrificed to reach this moment. I think that a lot of other tribal citizens felt that the day that we were celebrating the Supreme Court decision. I think we all felt that weight of history. And I wanted the reader to feel that weight of history \u2014 to understand this isn\u2019t a simple story of, \u201cYay, the tribes won!\u201d There\u2019s a lot that\u2019s implicated in that victory and a lot that was lost for that rare legal victory to happen.HCN:In the book you hold multiple difficult truths at once, like how George Jacobs\u2019 death \u2014 which caused so much pain for his community \u2014 was the origin of the Murphy case and also resulted in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. Similarly, the truth of your ancestor, John Ridge, who signed a treaty that resulted in forced removal of the Cherokee people. It was against their wishes, and also what he thought he had to do to save his nation. How did you navigate that? It can be so easy to collapse these tensions to make for a simpler narrative.RN:Absolutely. As a journalist, my North Star is the truth. And I think the truth is complicated. I don\u2019t think we can tell the whole story of theMcGirtvictory without talking about the crimes and the tragedy that it originated in. And I think the same is true for my ancestors. I was sort of raised to think one thing, but I went back through the historical records and really tried to look at it for what it was. There\u2019s a lot that we can learn from the desperation of my ancestors and their decision to sign that treaty. We can learn just how violent U.S. policy was at that time, that they would make a decision like that. There\u2019s a cultural impulse to tell stories where there are clear heroes and clear villains, and victories likeMcGirtcome from a good place, and things are clean-cut. I think that history is actually quite messy. I wanted a book that reflected that reality.Credit:Lauren CrowHCN:In the aftermath of the McGirt decision, the state of Oklahoma pushed a narrative of chaos and disruption in the criminal justice system, which some national outlets then repeated without much discernment. Can you talk about the role of the media \u2014 including the lack of Indigenous representation in newsrooms \u2014 and how that shapes the public\u2019s understanding of things like tribal sovereignty?RN:I think that it\u2019s a really big hindrance to our rights as Indigenous nations and to our sovereignty. Less than a fraction of a percent of the people staffing newsrooms are Native. Coverage of Indigenous issues very often fails to meet the standards of journalism. It doesn\u2019t have context, or a depth of knowledge of what\u2019s going on. They send reporters who\u2019ve never been on a reservation to do reporting about criminal justice on tribal land. It creates an environment where you can tell lies about tribes, and people will think that it\u2019s true.And unfortunately, that\u2019s what happened. In the wake ofMcGirt, (Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, R) made some very bold and outlandish claims about the number of criminal cases that could be prosecuted moving forward. I did some digging around with a fellow reporter, Allison Herrera, and Oklahoma\u2019s claims fell apart completely. But they were still repeated and cited by prominent outlets like theWashington PostandThe Wall Street Journal.Oklahoma then cited those articles in their briefs, and some of that inaccurate information was actually in the (Castro-Huerta) Supreme Court decision. And so it was this tornado of disinformation that made it all the way up to the Supreme Court. Normally, we think that theWashington Postis a check on bad information, but not when it comes to tribes, which should be an embarrassment for them.HCN:We\u2019re in a moment of major law and policy change under a new administration.

A lot of tribal programs, whether it\u2019s (the Indian Health Service) or tribal courts, tribal law enforcement, rely on federal dollars. There\u2019s a lot specifically at stake for tribes under Trump. The remaking of the federal judiciary has a profound impact on tribes, because our cases are federal; they don\u2019t go through state court. And, unfortunately, the courts \u2014 dating back to before Trump \u2014 have not been reliable sources for justice for tribes. Even when the law is clearly on the tribe\u2019s side, courts have a very bad habit of bending and breaking the rules to satisfy the state or non-Native residents. One of the things that\u2019s really shocked me is how often our government institutions ignore the law when it comes to tribes and how hard tribes have to fight for just the law to be followed.

Smith, High Country NewsMarch 25, 2025<h1>Rebecca Nagle considers Supreme Court wins and what\u2019s at stake for tribes under Trump</h1> <p class=\"byline\">by Anna V. Smith, High Country News <br />March 25, 2025</p> <p class=\"has-drop-cap\">During the forced<strong> </strong>removal of Muscogee (Creek) people from their ancestral lands in the Southeastern U.S., tribal members carried the embers and ashes of their town fires with them, determined to re-establish the flames in the new communities they planned to build in what\u2019s now known as Oklahoma. Those fires still burn today in places on the Muscogee Reservation.</p> <div class=\"wp-block-group alignright\"> <!-- RTT removed image (333291) --> <p class=\"has-text-align-left\"><em><em>By the Fire We Carry</em> </em><br />By Rebecca Nagle<br />352 pages, hardcover: $30<br />Harper, 2024.</p> </p></div> <p>In <em>By the Fire We Carry</em>, Cherokee journalist Rebecca Nagle documents the interwoven stories of tribal land dispossession, forced removal, a murder in a small tribal community, her own family history and three recent and consequential Supreme Court decisions about tribal jurisdiction over lands in Oklahoma. Two of them, <em>Murphy v. Oklahoma</em> and <em>McGirt v. Oklahoma, </em>centered on crimes on land that the state of Oklahoma argued was no longer part of the Muscogee and Cherokee Nations\u2019 respective reservations. In both cases, the Supreme Court upheld the tribes\u2019 arguments in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. But shortly after came <em>Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta</em>, in which the Supreme Court sidestepped a century of federal Indian law and gave states jurisdiction to prosecute crimes on tribal lands when the perpetrator was non-Native and the victim was Native. The connections Nagle makes span generations and offer insight into our current political turmoil, at a time when a second Trump administration is testing the limits of executive authority and the law.</p> <p>In a conversation with <em>High Country News</em>, Nagle discusses how the U.S. still wields its power of empire, what impact the Trump administration could have on tribal sovereignty, and the enduring weight of history.</p> <p><em>This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p> <p><strong><em>High Country News</em></strong>: <strong>In this book, you don\u2019t just focus on the 20-year histories of these three Supreme Court cases but also tell the stories of the Muscogee and Cherokee nations before the U.S. existed.

Smith, High Country NewsMarch 25, 2025<h1>Rebecca Nagle considers Supreme Court wins and what\u2019s at stake for tribes under Trump</h1> <p class=\"byline\">by Anna V. Smith, High Country News <br />March 25, 2025</p> <p class=\"has-drop-cap\">During the forced<strong> </strong>removal of Muscogee (Creek) people from their ancestral lands in the Southeastern U.S., tribal members carried the embers and ashes of their town fires with them, determined to re-establish the flames in the new communities they planned to build in what\u2019s now known as Oklahoma. Those fires still burn today in places on the Muscogee Reservation.</p> <div class=\"wp-block-group alignright\"> <!-- RTT removed image (333291) --> <p class=\"has-text-align-left\"><em><em>By the Fire We Carry</em> </em><br />By Rebecca Nagle<br />352 pages, hardcover: $30<br />Harper, 2024.</p> </p></div> <p>In <em>By the Fire We Carry</em>, Cherokee journalist Rebecca Nagle documents the interwoven stories of tribal land dispossession, forced removal, a murder in a small tribal community, her own family history and three recent and consequential Supreme Court decisions about tribal jurisdiction over lands in Oklahoma. Two of them, <em>Murphy v. Oklahoma</em> and <em>McGirt v. Oklahoma, </em>centered on crimes on land that the state of Oklahoma argued was no longer part of the Muscogee and Cherokee Nations\u2019 respective reservations. In both cases, the Supreme Court upheld the tribes\u2019 arguments in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. But shortly after came <em>Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta</em>, in which the Supreme Court sidestepped a century of federal Indian law and gave states jurisdiction to prosecute crimes on tribal lands when the perpetrator was non-Native and the victim was Native. The connections Nagle makes span generations and offer insight into our current political turmoil, at a time when a second Trump administration is testing the limits of executive authority and the law.</p> <p>In a conversation with <em>High Country News</em>, Nagle discusses how the U.S. still wields its power of empire, what impact the Trump administration could have on tribal sovereignty, and the enduring weight of history.</p> <p><em>This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p> <p><strong><em>High Country News</em></strong>: <strong>In this book, you don\u2019t just focus on the 20-year histories of these three Supreme Court cases but also tell the stories of the Muscogee and Cherokee nations before the U.S. existed. Why did you decide to take such a long view?</strong></p> <p><strong>Rebecca Nagle:</strong> One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present. I also wanted people to get a sense of how history repeats itself, and how things like a lie that tribal land is lawless get used over and over again, or the excuse that, \u201cOh, <em>this</em> is actually what\u2019s best for Native people.\u201d I wanted people to be able to see and identify those patterns.&nbsp;</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present.</p> </blockquote> <p>When I found out about the <em>McGirt</em> decision and saw the implications that my tribe\u2019s reservation would be recognized again, it was a really overwhelming emotion of relief, of joy, but there was also a lot of sadness, because I knew how much my ancestors, and Cherokee ancestors in general, had sacrificed to reach this moment. I think that a lot of other tribal citizens felt that the day that we were celebrating the Supreme Court decision. I think we all felt that weight of history. And I wanted the reader to feel that weight of history \u2014 to understand this isn\u2019t a simple story of, \u201cYay, the tribes won!\u201d There\u2019s a lot that\u2019s implicated in that victory and a lot that was lost for that rare legal victory to happen.</p> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the book you hold multiple difficult truths at once, like how George Jacobs\u2019 death \u2014 which caused so much pain for his community \u2014 was the origin of the Murphy case and also resulted in a historic win for tribal sovereignty.

And I think the truth is complicated. I don\u2019t think we can tell the whole story of the <em>McGirt</em> victory without talking about the crimes and the tragedy that it originated in. And I think the same is true for my ancestors. I was sort of raised to think one thing, but I went back through the historical records and really tried to look at it for what it was. There\u2019s a lot that we can learn from the desperation of my ancestors and their decision to sign that treaty. We can learn just how violent U.S. policy was at that time, that they would make a decision like that. There\u2019s a cultural impulse to tell stories where there are clear heroes and clear villains, and victories like <em>McGirt</em> come from a good place, and things are clean-cut. I think that history is actually quite messy. I wanted a book that reflected that reality.</p> <!-- RTT removed image (333265) --> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the aftermath of the McGirt decision, the state of Oklahoma pushed a narrative of chaos and disruption in the criminal justice system, which some national outlets then repeated without much discernment.

Less than a fraction of a percent of the people staffing newsrooms are Native. Coverage of Indigenous issues very often fails to meet the standards of journalism.

But they were still repeated and cited by prominent outlets like the <em>Washington Post</em> and <em>The Wall Street Journal.</em> Oklahoma then cited those articles in their briefs, and some of that inaccurate information was actually in the (<em>Castro-Huerta</em>) Supreme Court decision. And so it was this tornado of disinformation that made it all the way up to the Supreme Court.

And I think the treatment of Indigenous nations is a glaring example of that, because we\u2019ve never had any kind of constitutional amendment or reform to change those laws and to change those policies. To dispossess Indigenous people of their land, the U.S. government gave itself a lot of power over people who are not U.S. citizens. That power of empire is embedded in our Constitution, because our country wanted to take Indigenous land. We still see it manifested in deportation and shutting down asylum and separating families at the border and banning Muslims from entering our country. If we really don\u2019t want these types of policies to be enacted, there are some bigger questions about our democracy that as a society we haven\u2019t even begun to ask.</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p> If we really don\u2019t want these types of policies to be enacted, there are some bigger questions about our democracy that as a society we haven\u2019t even begun to ask.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>Given that, do you have any specific concerns about potential attacks on tribal sovereignty under a second Trump administration?</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> Everything has the capacity to get worse.

Smith, High Country NewsMarch 25, 2025<h1>Rebecca Nagle considers Supreme Court wins and what\u2019s at stake for tribes under Trump</h1> <p class=\"byline\">by Anna V. Smith, High Country News <br />March 25, 2025</p> <p class=\"has-drop-cap\">During the forced<strong> </strong>removal of Muscogee (Creek) people from their ancestral lands in the Southeastern U.S., tribal members carried the embers and ashes of their town fires with them, determined to re-establish the flames in the new communities they planned to build in what\u2019s now known as Oklahoma. Those fires still burn today in places on the Muscogee Reservation.</p> <div class=\"wp-block-group alignright\"> <!-- RTT removed image (333291) --> <p class=\"has-text-align-left\"><em><em>By the Fire We Carry</em> </em><br />By Rebecca Nagle<br />352 pages, hardcover: $30<br />Harper, 2024.</p> </p></div> <p>In <em>By the Fire We Carry</em>, Cherokee journalist Rebecca Nagle documents the interwoven stories of tribal land dispossession, forced removal, a murder in a small tribal community, her own family history and three recent and consequential Supreme Court decisions about tribal jurisdiction over lands in Oklahoma. Two of them, <em>Murphy v. Oklahoma</em> and <em>McGirt v. Oklahoma, </em>centered on crimes on land that the state of Oklahoma argued was no longer part of the Muscogee and Cherokee Nations\u2019 respective reservations. In both cases, the Supreme Court upheld the tribes\u2019 arguments in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. But shortly after came <em>Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta</em>, in which the Supreme Court sidestepped a century of federal Indian law and gave states jurisdiction to prosecute crimes on tribal lands when the perpetrator was non-Native and the victim was Native. The connections Nagle makes span generations and offer insight into our current political turmoil, at a time when a second Trump administration is testing the limits of executive authority and the law.</p> <p>In a conversation with <em>High Country News</em>, Nagle discusses how the U.S. still wields its power of empire, what impact the Trump administration could have on tribal sovereignty, and the enduring weight of history.</p> <p><em>This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p> <p><strong><em>High Country News</em></strong>: <strong>In this book, you don\u2019t just focus on the 20-year histories of these three Supreme Court cases but also tell the stories of the Muscogee and Cherokee nations before the U.S. existed. Why did you decide to take such a long view?</strong></p> <p><strong>Rebecca Nagle:</strong> One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present. I also wanted people to get a sense of how history repeats itself, and how things like a lie that tribal land is lawless get used over and over again, or the excuse that, \u201cOh, <em>this</em> is actually what\u2019s best for Native people.\u201d I wanted people to be able to see and identify those patterns.&nbsp;</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present.</p> </blockquote> <p>When I found out about the <em>McGirt</em> decision and saw the implications that my tribe\u2019s reservation would be recognized again, it was a really overwhelming emotion of relief, of joy, but there was also a lot of sadness, because I knew how much my ancestors, and Cherokee ancestors in general, had sacrificed to reach this moment. I think that a lot of other tribal citizens felt that the day that we were celebrating the Supreme Court decision. I think we all felt that weight of history. And I wanted the reader to feel that weight of history \u2014 to understand this isn\u2019t a simple story of, \u201cYay, the tribes won!\u201d There\u2019s a lot that\u2019s implicated in that victory and a lot that was lost for that rare legal victory to happen.</p> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the book you hold multiple difficult truths at once, like how George Jacobs\u2019 death \u2014 which caused so much pain for his community \u2014 was the origin of the Murphy case and also resulted in a historic win for tribal sovereignty.

The remaking of the federal judiciary has a profound impact on tribes, because our cases are federal; they don\u2019t go through state court. And, unfortunately, the courts \u2014 dating back to before Trump \u2014 have not been reliable sources for justice for tribes. Even when the law is clearly on the tribe\u2019s side, courts have a very bad habit of bending and breaking the rules to satisfy the state or non-Native residents. One of the things that\u2019s really shocked me is how often our government institutions ignore the law when it comes to tribes and how hard tribes have to fight for just the law to be followed. Those weaknesses in our democracy have been there for a long time.We welcome reader letters. EmailHigh Country Newsateditor@hcn.orgor submit aletter to the editor.

Smith, High Country NewsMarch 25, 2025<h1>Rebecca Nagle considers Supreme Court wins and what\u2019s at stake for tribes under Trump</h1> <p class=\"byline\">by Anna V. Smith, High Country News <br />March 25, 2025</p> <p class=\"has-drop-cap\">During the forced<strong> </strong>removal of Muscogee (Creek) people from their ancestral lands in the Southeastern U.S., tribal members carried the embers and ashes of their town fires with them, determined to re-establish the flames in the new communities they planned to build in what\u2019s now known as Oklahoma. Those fires still burn today in places on the Muscogee Reservation.</p> <div class=\"wp-block-group alignright\"> <!-- RTT removed image (333291) --> <p class=\"has-text-align-left\"><em><em>By the Fire We Carry</em> </em><br />By Rebecca Nagle<br />352 pages, hardcover: $30<br />Harper, 2024.</p> </p></div> <p>In <em>By the Fire We Carry</em>, Cherokee journalist Rebecca Nagle documents the interwoven stories of tribal land dispossession, forced removal, a murder in a small tribal community, her own family history and three recent and consequential Supreme Court decisions about tribal jurisdiction over lands in Oklahoma. Two of them, <em>Murphy v. Oklahoma</em> and <em>McGirt v. Oklahoma, </em>centered on crimes on land that the state of Oklahoma argued was no longer part of the Muscogee and Cherokee Nations\u2019 respective reservations. In both cases, the Supreme Court upheld the tribes\u2019 arguments in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. But shortly after came <em>Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta</em>, in which the Supreme Court sidestepped a century of federal Indian law and gave states jurisdiction to prosecute crimes on tribal lands when the perpetrator was non-Native and the victim was Native. The connections Nagle makes span generations and offer insight into our current political turmoil, at a time when a second Trump administration is testing the limits of executive authority and the law.</p> <p>In a conversation with <em>High Country News</em>, Nagle discusses how the U.S. still wields its power of empire, what impact the Trump administration could have on tribal sovereignty, and the enduring weight of history.</p> <p><em>This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p> <p><strong><em>High Country News</em></strong>: <strong>In this book, you don\u2019t just focus on the 20-year histories of these three Supreme Court cases but also tell the stories of the Muscogee and Cherokee nations before the U.S. existed. Why did you decide to take such a long view?</strong></p> <p><strong>Rebecca Nagle:</strong> One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present. I also wanted people to get a sense of how history repeats itself, and how things like a lie that tribal land is lawless get used over and over again, or the excuse that, \u201cOh, <em>this</em> is actually what\u2019s best for Native people.\u201d I wanted people to be able to see and identify those patterns.&nbsp;</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present.</p> </blockquote> <p>When I found out about the <em>McGirt</em> decision and saw the implications that my tribe\u2019s reservation would be recognized again, it was a really overwhelming emotion of relief, of joy, but there was also a lot of sadness, because I knew how much my ancestors, and Cherokee ancestors in general, had sacrificed to reach this moment. I think that a lot of other tribal citizens felt that the day that we were celebrating the Supreme Court decision. I think we all felt that weight of history. And I wanted the reader to feel that weight of history \u2014 to understand this isn\u2019t a simple story of, \u201cYay, the tribes won!\u201d There\u2019s a lot that\u2019s implicated in that victory and a lot that was lost for that rare legal victory to happen.</p> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the book you hold multiple difficult truths at once, like how George Jacobs\u2019 death \u2014 which caused so much pain for his community \u2014 was the origin of the Murphy case and also resulted in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. Similarly, the truth of your ancestor, John Ridge, who signed a treaty that resulted in forced removal of the Cherokee people. It was against their wishes, and also what he thought he had to do to save his nation. How did you navigate that? It can be so easy to collapse these tensions to make for a simpler narrative.&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> Absolutely. As a journalist, my North Star is the truth. And I think the truth is complicated. I don\u2019t think we can tell the whole story of the <em>McGirt</em> victory without talking about the crimes and the tragedy that it originated in. And I think the same is true for my ancestors. I was sort of raised to think one thing, but I went back through the historical records and really tried to look at it for what it was. There\u2019s a lot that we can learn from the desperation of my ancestors and their decision to sign that treaty. We can learn just how violent U.S. policy was at that time, that they would make a decision like that. There\u2019s a cultural impulse to tell stories where there are clear heroes and clear villains, and victories like <em>McGirt</em> come from a good place, and things are clean-cut. I think that history is actually quite messy. I wanted a book that reflected that reality.</p> <!-- RTT removed image (333265) --> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the aftermath of the McGirt decision, the state of Oklahoma pushed a narrative of chaos and disruption in the criminal justice system, which some national outlets then repeated without much discernment.

Less than a fraction of a percent of the people staffing newsrooms are Native. Coverage of Indigenous issues very often fails to meet the standards of journalism.

To dispossess Indigenous people of their land, the U.S. government gave itself a lot of power over people who are not U.S. citizens. That power of empire is embedded in our Constitution, because our country wanted to take Indigenous land. We still see it manifested in deportation and shutting down asylum and separating families at the border and banning Muslims from entering our country.

Two of them, <em>Murphy v. Oklahoma</em> and <em>McGirt v. Oklahoma, </em>centered on crimes on land that the state of Oklahoma argued was no longer part of the Muscogee and Cherokee Nations\u2019 respective reservations. In both cases, the Supreme Court upheld the tribes\u2019 arguments in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. But shortly after came <em>Oklahoma v.

Smith, High Country NewsMarch 25, 2025<h1>Rebecca Nagle considers Supreme Court wins and what\u2019s at stake for tribes under Trump</h1> <p class=\"byline\">by Anna V. Smith, High Country News <br />March 25, 2025</p> <p class=\"has-drop-cap\">During the forced<strong> </strong>removal of Muscogee (Creek) people from their ancestral lands in the Southeastern U.S., tribal members carried the embers and ashes of their town fires with them, determined to re-establish the flames in the new communities they planned to build in what\u2019s now known as Oklahoma. Those fires still burn today in places on the Muscogee Reservation.</p> <div class=\"wp-block-group alignright\"> <!-- RTT removed image (333291) --> <p class=\"has-text-align-left\"><em><em>By the Fire We Carry</em> </em><br />By Rebecca Nagle<br />352 pages, hardcover: $30<br />Harper, 2024.</p> </p></div> <p>In <em>By the Fire We Carry</em>, Cherokee journalist Rebecca Nagle documents the interwoven stories of tribal land dispossession, forced removal, a murder in a small tribal community, her own family history and three recent and consequential Supreme Court decisions about tribal jurisdiction over lands in Oklahoma. Two of them, <em>Murphy v. Oklahoma</em> and <em>McGirt v. Oklahoma, </em>centered on crimes on land that the state of Oklahoma argued was no longer part of the Muscogee and Cherokee Nations\u2019 respective reservations. In both cases, the Supreme Court upheld the tribes\u2019 arguments in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. But shortly after came <em>Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta</em>, in which the Supreme Court sidestepped a century of federal Indian law and gave states jurisdiction to prosecute crimes on tribal lands when the perpetrator was non-Native and the victim was Native. The connections Nagle makes span generations and offer insight into our current political turmoil, at a time when a second Trump administration is testing the limits of executive authority and the law.</p> <p>In a conversation with <em>High Country News</em>, Nagle discusses how the U.S. still wields its power of empire, what impact the Trump administration could have on tribal sovereignty, and the enduring weight of history.</p> <p><em>This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p> <p><strong><em>High Country News</em></strong>: <strong>In this book, you don\u2019t just focus on the 20-year histories of these three Supreme Court cases but also tell the stories of the Muscogee and Cherokee nations before the U.S. existed. Why did you decide to take such a long view?</strong></p> <p><strong>Rebecca Nagle:</strong> One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present. I also wanted people to get a sense of how history repeats itself, and how things like a lie that tribal land is lawless get used over and over again, or the excuse that, \u201cOh, <em>this</em> is actually what\u2019s best for Native people.\u201d I wanted people to be able to see and identify those patterns.&nbsp;</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present.</p> </blockquote> <p>When I found out about the <em>McGirt</em> decision and saw the implications that my tribe\u2019s reservation would be recognized again, it was a really overwhelming emotion of relief, of joy, but there was also a lot of sadness, because I knew how much my ancestors, and Cherokee ancestors in general, had sacrificed to reach this moment. I think that a lot of other tribal citizens felt that the day that we were celebrating the Supreme Court decision. I think we all felt that weight of history. And I wanted the reader to feel that weight of history \u2014 to understand this isn\u2019t a simple story of, \u201cYay, the tribes won!\u201d There\u2019s a lot that\u2019s implicated in that victory and a lot that was lost for that rare legal victory to happen.</p> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the book you hold multiple difficult truths at once, like how George Jacobs\u2019 death \u2014 which caused so much pain for his community \u2014 was the origin of the Murphy case and also resulted in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. Similarly, the truth of your ancestor, John Ridge, who signed a treaty that resulted in forced removal of the Cherokee people. It was against their wishes, and also what he thought he had to do to save his nation. How did you navigate that? It can be so easy to collapse these tensions to make for a simpler narrative.&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> Absolutely. As a journalist, my North Star is the truth. And I think the truth is complicated. I don\u2019t think we can tell the whole story of the <em>McGirt</em> victory without talking about the crimes and the tragedy that it originated in. And I think the same is true for my ancestors. I was sort of raised to think one thing, but I went back through the historical records and really tried to look at it for what it was. There\u2019s a lot that we can learn from the desperation of my ancestors and their decision to sign that treaty. We can learn just how violent U.S. policy was at that time, that they would make a decision like that. There\u2019s a cultural impulse to tell stories where there are clear heroes and clear villains, and victories like <em>McGirt</em> come from a good place, and things are clean-cut. I think that history is actually quite messy. I wanted a book that reflected that reality.</p> <!-- RTT removed image (333265) --> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the aftermath of the McGirt decision, the state of Oklahoma pushed a narrative of chaos and disruption in the criminal justice system, which some national outlets then repeated without much discernment.

The connections Nagle makes span generations and offer insight into our current political turmoil, at a time when a second Trump administration is testing the limits of executive authority and the law.</p> <p>In a conversation with <em>High Country News</em>, Nagle discusses how the U.S. still wields its power of empire, what impact the Trump administration could have on tribal sovereignty, and the enduring weight of history.</p> <p><em>This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p> <p><strong><em>High Country News</em></strong>: <strong>In this book, you don\u2019t just focus on the 20-year histories of these three Supreme Court cases but also tell the stories of the Muscogee and Cherokee nations before the U.S. existed. Why did you decide to take such a long view?</strong></p> <p><strong>Rebecca Nagle:</strong> One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present. I also wanted people to get a sense of how history repeats itself, and how things like a lie that tribal land is lawless get used over and over again, or the excuse that, \u201cOh, <em>this</em> is actually what\u2019s best for Native people.\u201d I wanted people to be able to see and identify those patterns.&nbsp;</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present.</p> </blockquote> <p>When I found out about the <em>McGirt</em> decision and saw the implications that my tribe\u2019s reservation would be recognized again, it was a really overwhelming emotion of relief, of joy, but there was also a lot of sadness, because I knew how much my ancestors, and Cherokee ancestors in general, had sacrificed to reach this moment. I think that a lot of other tribal citizens felt that the day that we were celebrating the Supreme Court decision. I think we all felt that weight of history. And I wanted the reader to feel that weight of history \u2014 to understand this isn\u2019t a simple story of, \u201cYay, the tribes won!\u201d There\u2019s a lot that\u2019s implicated in that victory and a lot that was lost for that rare legal victory to happen.</p> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the book you hold multiple difficult truths at once, like how George Jacobs\u2019 death \u2014 which caused so much pain for his community \u2014 was the origin of the Murphy case and also resulted in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. Similarly, the truth of your ancestor, John Ridge, who signed a treaty that resulted in forced removal of the Cherokee people. It was against their wishes, and also what he thought he had to do to save his nation. How did you navigate that? It can be so easy to collapse these tensions to make for a simpler narrative.&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> Absolutely. As a journalist, my North Star is the truth. And I think the truth is complicated. I don\u2019t think we can tell the whole story of the <em>McGirt</em> victory without talking about the crimes and the tragedy that it originated in. And I think the same is true for my ancestors. I was sort of raised to think one thing, but I went back through the historical records and really tried to look at it for what it was. There\u2019s a lot that we can learn from the desperation of my ancestors and their decision to sign that treaty. We can learn just how violent U.S. policy was at that time, that they would make a decision like that. There\u2019s a cultural impulse to tell stories where there are clear heroes and clear villains, and victories like <em>McGirt</em> come from a good place, and things are clean-cut. I think that history is actually quite messy. I wanted a book that reflected that reality.</p> <!-- RTT removed image (333265) --> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the aftermath of the McGirt decision, the state of Oklahoma pushed a narrative of chaos and disruption in the criminal justice system, which some national outlets then repeated without much discernment. Can you talk about the role of the media \u2014 including the lack of Indigenous representation in newsrooms \u2014 and how that shapes the public\u2019s understanding of things like tribal sovereignty?</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> I think that it\u2019s a really big hindrance to our rights as Indigenous nations and to our sovereignty. Less than a fraction of a percent of the people staffing newsrooms are Native. Coverage of Indigenous issues very often fails to meet the standards of journalism. It doesn\u2019t have context, or a depth of knowledge of what\u2019s going on. They send reporters who\u2019ve never been on a reservation to do reporting about criminal justice on tribal land. It creates an environment where you can tell lies about tribes, and people will think that it\u2019s true.</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> </blockquote> <p>And unfortunately, that\u2019s what happened. In the wake of <em>McGirt</em>, (Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, R) made some very bold and outlandish claims about the number of criminal cases that could be prosecuted moving forward. I did some digging around with a fellow reporter, Allison Herrera, and Oklahoma\u2019s claims fell apart completely. But they were still repeated and cited by prominent outlets like the <em>Washington Post</em> and <em>The Wall Street Journal.</em> Oklahoma then cited those articles in their briefs, and some of that inaccurate information was actually in the (<em>Castro-Huerta</em>) Supreme Court decision. And so it was this tornado of disinformation that made it all the way up to the Supreme Court. Normally, we think that the <em>Washington Post</em> is a check on bad information, but not when it comes to tribes, which should be an embarrassment for them.</p> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>We\u2019re in a moment of major law and policy change under a new administration.

And I think the treatment of Indigenous nations is a glaring example of that, because we\u2019ve never had any kind of constitutional amendment or reform to change those laws and to change those policies. To dispossess Indigenous people of their land, the U.S. government gave itself a lot of power over people who are not U.S. citizens. That power of empire is embedded in our Constitution, because our country wanted to take Indigenous land.

Smith, High Country NewsMarch 25, 2025<h1>Rebecca Nagle considers Supreme Court wins and what\u2019s at stake for tribes under Trump</h1> <p class=\"byline\">by Anna V. Smith, High Country News <br />March 25, 2025</p> <p class=\"has-drop-cap\">During the forced<strong> </strong>removal of Muscogee (Creek) people from their ancestral lands in the Southeastern U.S., tribal members carried the embers and ashes of their town fires with them, determined to re-establish the flames in the new communities they planned to build in what\u2019s now known as Oklahoma. Those fires still burn today in places on the Muscogee Reservation.</p> <div class=\"wp-block-group alignright\"> <!-- RTT removed image (333291) --> <p class=\"has-text-align-left\"><em><em>By the Fire We Carry</em> </em><br />By Rebecca Nagle<br />352 pages, hardcover: $30<br />Harper, 2024.</p> </p></div> <p>In <em>By the Fire We Carry</em>, Cherokee journalist Rebecca Nagle documents the interwoven stories of tribal land dispossession, forced removal, a murder in a small tribal community, her own family history and three recent and consequential Supreme Court decisions about tribal jurisdiction over lands in Oklahoma. Two of them, <em>Murphy v. Oklahoma</em> and <em>McGirt v. Oklahoma, </em>centered on crimes on land that the state of Oklahoma argued was no longer part of the Muscogee and Cherokee Nations\u2019 respective reservations. In both cases, the Supreme Court upheld the tribes\u2019 arguments in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. But shortly after came <em>Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta</em>, in which the Supreme Court sidestepped a century of federal Indian law and gave states jurisdiction to prosecute crimes on tribal lands when the perpetrator was non-Native and the victim was Native.

Smith, High Country NewsMarch 25, 2025<h1>Rebecca Nagle considers Supreme Court wins and what\u2019s at stake for tribes under Trump</h1> <p class=\"byline\">by Anna V. Smith, High Country News <br />March 25, 2025</p> <p class=\"has-drop-cap\">During the forced<strong> </strong>removal of Muscogee (Creek) people from their ancestral lands in the Southeastern U.S., tribal members carried the embers and ashes of their town fires with them, determined to re-establish the flames in the new communities they planned to build in what\u2019s now known as Oklahoma. Those fires still burn today in places on the Muscogee Reservation.</p> <div class=\"wp-block-group alignright\"> <!-- RTT removed image (333291) --> <p class=\"has-text-align-left\"><em><em>By the Fire We Carry</em> </em><br />By Rebecca Nagle<br />352 pages, hardcover: $30<br />Harper, 2024.</p> </p></div> <p>In <em>By the Fire We Carry</em>, Cherokee journalist Rebecca Nagle documents the interwoven stories of tribal land dispossession, forced removal, a murder in a small tribal community, her own family history and three recent and consequential Supreme Court decisions about tribal jurisdiction over lands in Oklahoma. Two of them, <em>Murphy v. Oklahoma</em> and <em>McGirt v. Oklahoma, </em>centered on crimes on land that the state of Oklahoma argued was no longer part of the Muscogee and Cherokee Nations\u2019 respective reservations. In both cases, the Supreme Court upheld the tribes\u2019 arguments in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. But shortly after came <em>Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta</em>, in which the Supreme Court sidestepped a century of federal Indian law and gave states jurisdiction to prosecute crimes on tribal lands when the perpetrator was non-Native and the victim was Native. The connections Nagle makes span generations and offer insight into our current political turmoil, at a time when a second Trump administration is testing the limits of executive authority and the law.</p> <p>In a conversation with <em>High Country News</em>, Nagle discusses how the U.S. still wields its power of empire, what impact the Trump administration could have on tribal sovereignty, and the enduring weight of history.</p> <p><em>This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p> <p><strong><em>High Country News</em></strong>: <strong>In this book, you don\u2019t just focus on the 20-year histories of these three Supreme Court cases but also tell the stories of the Muscogee and Cherokee nations before the U.S. existed. Why did you decide to take such a long view?</strong></p> <p><strong>Rebecca Nagle:</strong> One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present. I also wanted people to get a sense of how history repeats itself, and how things like a lie that tribal land is lawless get used over and over again, or the excuse that, \u201cOh, <em>this</em> is actually what\u2019s best for Native people.\u201d I wanted people to be able to see and identify those patterns.&nbsp;</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present.</p> </blockquote> <p>When I found out about the <em>McGirt</em> decision and saw the implications that my tribe\u2019s reservation would be recognized again, it was a really overwhelming emotion of relief, of joy, but there was also a lot of sadness, because I knew how much my ancestors, and Cherokee ancestors in general, had sacrificed to reach this moment. I think that a lot of other tribal citizens felt that the day that we were celebrating the Supreme Court decision. I think we all felt that weight of history. And I wanted the reader to feel that weight of history \u2014 to understand this isn\u2019t a simple story of, \u201cYay, the tribes won!\u201d There\u2019s a lot that\u2019s implicated in that victory and a lot that was lost for that rare legal victory to happen.</p> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the book you hold multiple difficult truths at once, like how George Jacobs\u2019 death \u2014 which caused so much pain for his community \u2014 was the origin of the Murphy case and also resulted in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. Similarly, the truth of your ancestor, John Ridge, who signed a treaty that resulted in forced removal of the Cherokee people. It was against their wishes, and also what he thought he had to do to save his nation. How did you navigate that? It can be so easy to collapse these tensions to make for a simpler narrative.&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> Absolutely. As a journalist, my North Star is the truth. And I think the truth is complicated. I don\u2019t think we can tell the whole story of the <em>McGirt</em> victory without talking about the crimes and the tragedy that it originated in. And I think the same is true for my ancestors. I was sort of raised to think one thing, but I went back through the historical records and really tried to look at it for what it was. There\u2019s a lot that we can learn from the desperation of my ancestors and their decision to sign that treaty. We can learn just how violent U.S. policy was at that time, that they would make a decision like that. There\u2019s a cultural impulse to tell stories where there are clear heroes and clear villains, and victories like <em>McGirt</em> come from a good place, and things are clean-cut. I think that history is actually quite messy. I wanted a book that reflected that reality.</p> <!-- RTT removed image (333265) --> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the aftermath of the McGirt decision, the state of Oklahoma pushed a narrative of chaos and disruption in the criminal justice system, which some national outlets then repeated without much discernment. Can you talk about the role of the media \u2014 including the lack of Indigenous representation in newsrooms \u2014 and how that shapes the public\u2019s understanding of things like tribal sovereignty?</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> I think that it\u2019s a really big hindrance to our rights as Indigenous nations and to our sovereignty. Less than a fraction of a percent of the people staffing newsrooms are Native. Coverage of Indigenous issues very often fails to meet the standards of journalism. It doesn\u2019t have context, or a depth of knowledge of what\u2019s going on. They send reporters who\u2019ve never been on a reservation to do reporting about criminal justice on tribal land. It creates an environment where you can tell lies about tribes, and people will think that it\u2019s true.</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> </blockquote> <p>And unfortunately, that\u2019s what happened. In the wake of <em>McGirt</em>, (Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, R) made some very bold and outlandish claims about the number of criminal cases that could be prosecuted moving forward. I did some digging around with a fellow reporter, Allison Herrera, and Oklahoma\u2019s claims fell apart completely. But they were still repeated and cited by prominent outlets like the <em>Washington Post</em> and <em>The Wall Street Journal.</em> Oklahoma then cited those articles in their briefs, and some of that inaccurate information was actually in the (<em>Castro-Huerta</em>) Supreme Court decision. And so it was this tornado of disinformation that made it all the way up to the Supreme Court. Normally, we think that the <em>Washington Post</em> is a check on bad information, but not when it comes to tribes, which should be an embarrassment for them.</p> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>We\u2019re in a moment of major law and policy change under a new administration. What are some lessons from your reporting that apply to our current moment?</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> We talk about it as a problem that originates with Trump, instead of a problem that originates with some of the flaws in our democracy. And I think the treatment of Indigenous nations is a glaring example of that, because we\u2019ve never had any kind of constitutional amendment or reform to change those laws and to change those policies. To dispossess Indigenous people of their land, the U.S. government gave itself a lot of power over people who are not U.S. citizens. That power of empire is embedded in our Constitution, because our country wanted to take Indigenous land. We still see it manifested in deportation and shutting down asylum and separating families at the border and banning Muslims from entering our country. If we really don\u2019t want these types of policies to be enacted, there are some bigger questions about our democracy that as a society we haven\u2019t even begun to ask.</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p> If we really don\u2019t want these types of policies to be enacted, there are some bigger questions about our democracy that as a society we haven\u2019t even begun to ask.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>Given that, do you have any specific concerns about potential attacks on tribal sovereignty under a second Trump administration?</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> Everything has the capacity to get worse. A lot of tribal programs, whether it\u2019s (the Indian Health Service) or tribal courts, tribal law enforcement, rely on federal dollars. There\u2019s a lot specifically at stake for tribes under Trump. The remaking of the federal judiciary has a profound impact on tribes, because our cases are federal; they don\u2019t go through state court. And, unfortunately, the courts \u2014 dating back to before Trump \u2014 have not been reliable sources for justice for tribes. Even when the law is clearly on the tribe\u2019s side, courts have a very bad habit of bending and breaking the rules to satisfy the state or non-Native residents. One of the things that\u2019s really shocked me is how often our government institutions ignore the law when it comes to tribes and how hard tribes have to fight for just the law to be followed.

Smith, High Country NewsMarch 25, 2025<h1>Rebecca Nagle considers Supreme Court wins and what\u2019s at stake for tribes under Trump</h1> <p class=\"byline\">by Anna V. Smith, High Country News <br />March 25, 2025</p> <p class=\"has-drop-cap\">During the forced<strong> </strong>removal of Muscogee (Creek) people from their ancestral lands in the Southeastern U.S., tribal members carried the embers and ashes of their town fires with them, determined to re-establish the flames in the new communities they planned to build in what\u2019s now known as Oklahoma. Those fires still burn today in places on the Muscogee Reservation.</p> <div class=\"wp-block-group alignright\"> <!-- RTT removed image (333291) --> <p class=\"has-text-align-left\"><em><em>By the Fire We Carry</em> </em><br />By Rebecca Nagle<br />352 pages, hardcover: $30<br />Harper, 2024.</p> </p></div> <p>In <em>By the Fire We Carry</em>, Cherokee journalist Rebecca Nagle documents the interwoven stories of tribal land dispossession, forced removal, a murder in a small tribal community, her own family history and three recent and consequential Supreme Court decisions about tribal jurisdiction over lands in Oklahoma. Two of them, <em>Murphy v. Oklahoma</em> and <em>McGirt v. Oklahoma, </em>centered on crimes on land that the state of Oklahoma argued was no longer part of the Muscogee and Cherokee Nations\u2019 respective reservations. In both cases, the Supreme Court upheld the tribes\u2019 arguments in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. But shortly after came <em>Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta</em>, in which the Supreme Court sidestepped a century of federal Indian law and gave states jurisdiction to prosecute crimes on tribal lands when the perpetrator was non-Native and the victim was Native. The connections Nagle makes span generations and offer insight into our current political turmoil, at a time when a second Trump administration is testing the limits of executive authority and the law.</p> <p>In a conversation with <em>High Country News</em>, Nagle discusses how the U.S. still wields its power of empire, what impact the Trump administration could have on tribal sovereignty, and the enduring weight of history.</p> <p><em>This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p> <p><strong><em>High Country News</em></strong>: <strong>In this book, you don\u2019t just focus on the 20-year histories of these three Supreme Court cases but also tell the stories of the Muscogee and Cherokee nations before the U.S. existed. Why did you decide to take such a long view?</strong></p> <p><strong>Rebecca Nagle:</strong> One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present. I also wanted people to get a sense of how history repeats itself, and how things like a lie that tribal land is lawless get used over and over again, or the excuse that, \u201cOh, <em>this</em> is actually what\u2019s best for Native people.\u201d I wanted people to be able to see and identify those patterns.&nbsp;</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present.</p> </blockquote> <p>When I found out about the <em>McGirt</em> decision and saw the implications that my tribe\u2019s reservation would be recognized again, it was a really overwhelming emotion of relief, of joy, but there was also a lot of sadness, because I knew how much my ancestors, and Cherokee ancestors in general, had sacrificed to reach this moment. I think that a lot of other tribal citizens felt that the day that we were celebrating the Supreme Court decision. I think we all felt that weight of history. And I wanted the reader to feel that weight of history \u2014 to understand this isn\u2019t a simple story of, \u201cYay, the tribes won!\u201d There\u2019s a lot that\u2019s implicated in that victory and a lot that was lost for that rare legal victory to happen.</p> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the book you hold multiple difficult truths at once, like how George Jacobs\u2019 death \u2014 which caused so much pain for his community \u2014 was the origin of the Murphy case and also resulted in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. Similarly, the truth of your ancestor, John Ridge, who signed a treaty that resulted in forced removal of the Cherokee people. It was against their wishes, and also what he thought he had to do to save his nation. How did you navigate that? It can be so easy to collapse these tensions to make for a simpler narrative.&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> Absolutely. As a journalist, my North Star is the truth. And I think the truth is complicated. I don\u2019t think we can tell the whole story of the <em>McGirt</em> victory without talking about the crimes and the tragedy that it originated in. And I think the same is true for my ancestors. I was sort of raised to think one thing, but I went back through the historical records and really tried to look at it for what it was. There\u2019s a lot that we can learn from the desperation of my ancestors and their decision to sign that treaty. We can learn just how violent U.S. policy was at that time, that they would make a decision like that. There\u2019s a cultural impulse to tell stories where there are clear heroes and clear villains, and victories like <em>McGirt</em> come from a good place, and things are clean-cut. I think that history is actually quite messy. I wanted a book that reflected that reality.</p> <!-- RTT removed image (333265) --> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the aftermath of the McGirt decision, the state of Oklahoma pushed a narrative of chaos and disruption in the criminal justice system, which some national outlets then repeated without much discernment. Can you talk about the role of the media \u2014 including the lack of Indigenous representation in newsrooms \u2014 and how that shapes the public\u2019s understanding of things like tribal sovereignty?</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> I think that it\u2019s a really big hindrance to our rights as Indigenous nations and to our sovereignty. Less than a fraction of a percent of the people staffing newsrooms are Native. Coverage of Indigenous issues very often fails to meet the standards of journalism. It doesn\u2019t have context, or a depth of knowledge of what\u2019s going on. They send reporters who\u2019ve never been on a reservation to do reporting about criminal justice on tribal land. It creates an environment where you can tell lies about tribes, and people will think that it\u2019s true.</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> </blockquote> <p>And unfortunately, that\u2019s what happened. In the wake of <em>McGirt</em>, (Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, R) made some very bold and outlandish claims about the number of criminal cases that could be prosecuted moving forward. I did some digging around with a fellow reporter, Allison Herrera, and Oklahoma\u2019s claims fell apart completely. But they were still repeated and cited by prominent outlets like the <em>Washington Post</em> and <em>The Wall Street Journal.</em> Oklahoma then cited those articles in their briefs, and some of that inaccurate information was actually in the (<em>Castro-Huerta</em>) Supreme Court decision. And so it was this tornado of disinformation that made it all the way up to the Supreme Court. Normally, we think that the <em>Washington Post</em> is a check on bad information, but not when it comes to tribes, which should be an embarrassment for them.</p> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>We\u2019re in a moment of major law and policy change under a new administration. What are some lessons from your reporting that apply to our current moment?</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> We talk about it as a problem that originates with Trump, instead of a problem that originates with some of the flaws in our democracy. And I think the treatment of Indigenous nations is a glaring example of that, because we\u2019ve never had any kind of constitutional amendment or reform to change those laws and to change those policies. To dispossess Indigenous people of their land, the U.S. government gave itself a lot of power over people who are not U.S. citizens. That power of empire is embedded in our Constitution, because our country wanted to take Indigenous land. We still see it manifested in deportation and shutting down asylum and separating families at the border and banning Muslims from entering our country. If we really don\u2019t want these types of policies to be enacted, there are some bigger questions about our democracy that as a society we haven\u2019t even begun to ask.</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p> If we really don\u2019t want these types of policies to be enacted, there are some bigger questions about our democracy that as a society we haven\u2019t even begun to ask.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>Given that, do you have any specific concerns about potential attacks on tribal sovereignty under a second Trump administration?</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> Everything has the capacity to get worse. A lot of tribal programs, whether it\u2019s (the Indian Health Service) or tribal courts, tribal law enforcement, rely on federal dollars. There\u2019s a lot specifically at stake for tribes under Trump. The remaking of the federal judiciary has a profound impact on tribes, because our cases are federal; they don\u2019t go through state court. And, unfortunately, the courts \u2014 dating back to before Trump \u2014 have not been reliable sources for justice for tribes. Even when the law is clearly on the tribe\u2019s side, courts have a very bad habit of bending and breaking the rules to satisfy the state or non-Native residents. One of the things that\u2019s really shocked me is how often our government institutions ignore the law when it comes to tribes and how hard tribes have to fight for just the law to be followed.

Smith, High Country NewsMarch 25, 2025 By the Fire We CarryBy Rebecca Nagle352 pages, hardcover: $30Harper, 2024. InBy the Fire We Carry, Cherokee journalist Rebecca Nagle documents the interwoven stories of tribal land dispossession, forced removal, a murder in a small tribal community, her own family history and three recent and consequential Supreme Court decisions about tribal jurisdiction over lands in Oklahoma. Two of them,Murphy v. OklahomaandMcGirt v. Oklahoma,centered on crimes on land that the state of Oklahoma argued was no longer part of the Muscogee and Cherokee Nations\u2019 respective reservations. In both cases, the Supreme Court upheld the tribes\u2019 arguments in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. But shortly after cameOklahoma v. Castro-Huerta, in which the Supreme Court sidestepped a century of federal Indian law and gave states jurisdiction to prosecute crimes on tribal lands when the perpetrator was non-Native and the victim was Native. The connections Nagle makes span generations and offer insight into our current political turmoil, at a time when a second Trump administration is testing the limits of executive authority and the law.In a conversation withHigh Country News, Nagle discusses how the U.S. still wields its power of empire, what impact the Trump administration could have on tribal sovereignty, and the enduring weight of history.This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.High Country News:In this book, you don\u2019t just focus on the 20-year histories of these three Supreme Court cases but also tell the stories of the Muscogee and Cherokee nations before the U.S. existed. Why did you decide to take such a long view?Rebecca Nagle:One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present. I also wanted people to get a sense of how history repeats itself, and how things like a lie that tribal land is lawless get used over and over again, or the excuse that, \u201cOh,thisis actually what\u2019s best for Native people.\u201d I wanted people to be able to see and identify those patterns.One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present.When I found out about theMcGirtdecision and saw the implications that my tribe\u2019s reservation would be recognized again, it was a really overwhelming emotion of relief, of joy, but there was also a lot of sadness, because I knew how much my ancestors, and Cherokee ancestors in general, had sacrificed to reach this moment. I think that a lot of other tribal citizens felt that the day that we were celebrating the Supreme Court decision. I think we all felt that weight of history. And I wanted the reader to feel that weight of history \u2014 to understand this isn\u2019t a simple story of, \u201cYay, the tribes won!\u201d There\u2019s a lot that\u2019s implicated in that victory and a lot that was lost for that rare legal victory to happen.HCN:In the book you hold multiple difficult truths at once, like how George Jacobs\u2019 death \u2014 which caused so much pain for his community \u2014 was the origin of the Murphy case and also resulted in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. Similarly, the truth of your ancestor, John Ridge, who signed a treaty that resulted in forced removal of the Cherokee people. It was against their wishes, and also what he thought he had to do to save his nation. How did you navigate that? It can be so easy to collapse these tensions to make for a simpler narrative.RN:Absolutely. As a journalist, my North Star is the truth. And I think the truth is complicated. I don\u2019t think we can tell the whole story of theMcGirtvictory without talking about the crimes and the tragedy that it originated in. And I think the same is true for my ancestors. I was sort of raised to think one thing, but I went back through the historical records and really tried to look at it for what it was. There\u2019s a lot that we can learn from the desperation of my ancestors and their decision to sign that treaty. We can learn just how violent U.S. policy was at that time, that they would make a decision like that. There\u2019s a cultural impulse to tell stories where there are clear heroes and clear villains, and victories likeMcGirtcome from a good place, and things are clean-cut. I think that history is actually quite messy. I wanted a book that reflected that reality.Credit:Lauren CrowHCN:In the aftermath of the McGirt decision, the state of Oklahoma pushed a narrative of chaos and disruption in the criminal justice system, which some national outlets then repeated without much discernment. Can you talk about the role of the media \u2014 including the lack of Indigenous representation in newsrooms \u2014 and how that shapes the public\u2019s understanding of things like tribal sovereignty?RN:I think that it\u2019s a really big hindrance to our rights as Indigenous nations and to our sovereignty. Less than a fraction of a percent of the people staffing newsrooms are Native. Coverage of Indigenous issues very often fails to meet the standards of journalism. It doesn\u2019t have context, or a depth of knowledge of what\u2019s going on. They send reporters who\u2019ve never been on a reservation to do reporting about criminal justice on tribal land. It creates an environment where you can tell lies about tribes, and people will think that it\u2019s true.And unfortunately, that\u2019s what happened. In the wake ofMcGirt, (Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, R) made some very bold and outlandish claims about the number of criminal cases that could be prosecuted moving forward. I did some digging around with a fellow reporter, Allison Herrera, and Oklahoma\u2019s claims fell apart completely. But they were still repeated and cited by prominent outlets like theWashington PostandThe Wall Street Journal.Oklahoma then cited those articles in their briefs, and some of that inaccurate information was actually in the (Castro-Huerta) Supreme Court decision. And so it was this tornado of disinformation that made it all the way up to the Supreme Court. Normally, we think that theWashington Postis a check on bad information, but not when it comes to tribes, which should be an embarrassment for them.HCN:We\u2019re in a moment of major law and policy change under a new administration.

And I think the treatment of Indigenous nations is a glaring example of that, because we\u2019ve never had any kind of constitutional amendment or reform to change those laws and to change those policies. To dispossess Indigenous people of their land, the U.S. government gave itself a lot of power over people who are not U.S. citizens. That power of empire is embedded in our Constitution, because our country wanted to take Indigenous land. We still see it manifested in deportation and shutting down asylum and separating families at the border and banning Muslims from entering our country. If we really don\u2019t want these types of policies to be enacted, there are some bigger questions about our democracy that as a society we haven\u2019t even begun to ask.If we really don\u2019t want these types of policies to be enacted, there are some bigger questions about our democracy that as a society we haven\u2019t even begun to ask.HCN:Given that, do you have any specific concerns about potential attacks on tribal sovereignty under a second Trump administration?RN:Everything has the capacity to get worse. A lot of tribal programs, whether it\u2019s (the Indian Health Service) or tribal courts, tribal law enforcement, rely on federal dollars. There\u2019s a lot specifically at stake for tribes under Trump. The remaking of the federal judiciary has a profound impact on tribes, because our cases are federal; they don\u2019t go through state court. And, unfortunately, the courts \u2014 dating back to before Trump \u2014 have not been reliable sources for justice for tribes. Even when the law is clearly on the tribe\u2019s side, courts have a very bad habit of bending and breaking the rules to satisfy the state or non-Native residents. One of the things that\u2019s really shocked me is how often our government institutions ignore the law when it comes to tribes and how hard tribes have to fight for just the law to be followed.

Smith, High Country News <br />March 25, 2025</p> <p class=\"has-drop-cap\">During the forced<strong> </strong>removal of Muscogee (Creek) people from their ancestral lands in the Southeastern U.S., tribal members carried the embers and ashes of their town fires with them, determined to re-establish the flames in the new communities they planned to build in what\u2019s now known as Oklahoma. Those fires still burn today in places on the Muscogee Reservation.</p> <div class=\"wp-block-group alignright\"> <!-- RTT removed image (333291) --> <p class=\"has-text-align-left\"><em><em>By the Fire We Carry</em> </em><br />By Rebecca Nagle<br />352 pages, hardcover: $30<br />Harper, 2024.</p> </p></div> <p>In <em>By the Fire We Carry</em>, Cherokee journalist Rebecca Nagle documents the interwoven stories of tribal land dispossession, forced removal, a murder in a small tribal community, her own family history and three recent and consequential Supreme Court decisions about tribal jurisdiction over lands in Oklahoma. Two of them, <em>Murphy v. Oklahoma</em> and <em>McGirt v. Oklahoma, </em>centered on crimes on land that the state of Oklahoma argued was no longer part of the Muscogee and Cherokee Nations\u2019 respective reservations. In both cases, the Supreme Court upheld the tribes\u2019 arguments in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. But shortly after came <em>Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta</em>, in which the Supreme Court sidestepped a century of federal Indian law and gave states jurisdiction to prosecute crimes on tribal lands when the perpetrator was non-Native and the victim was Native. The connections Nagle makes span generations and offer insight into our current political turmoil, at a time when a second Trump administration is testing the limits of executive authority and the law.</p> <p>In a conversation with <em>High Country News</em>, Nagle discusses how the U.S. still wields its power of empire, what impact the Trump administration could have on tribal sovereignty, and the enduring weight of history.</p> <p><em>This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p> <p><strong><em>High Country News</em></strong>: <strong>In this book, you don\u2019t just focus on the 20-year histories of these three Supreme Court cases but also tell the stories of the Muscogee and Cherokee nations before the U.S. existed. Why did you decide to take such a long view?</strong></p> <p><strong>Rebecca Nagle:</strong> One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present. I also wanted people to get a sense of how history repeats itself, and how things like a lie that tribal land is lawless get used over and over again, or the excuse that, \u201cOh, <em>this</em> is actually what\u2019s best for Native people.\u201d I wanted people to be able to see and identify those patterns.&nbsp;</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present.</p> </blockquote> <p>When I found out about the <em>McGirt</em> decision and saw the implications that my tribe\u2019s reservation would be recognized again, it was a really overwhelming emotion of relief, of joy, but there was also a lot of sadness, because I knew how much my ancestors, and Cherokee ancestors in general, had sacrificed to reach this moment. I think that a lot of other tribal citizens felt that the day that we were celebrating the Supreme Court decision. I think we all felt that weight of history. And I wanted the reader to feel that weight of history \u2014 to understand this isn\u2019t a simple story of, \u201cYay, the tribes won!\u201d There\u2019s a lot that\u2019s implicated in that victory and a lot that was lost for that rare legal victory to happen.</p> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the book you hold multiple difficult truths at once, like how George Jacobs\u2019 death \u2014 which caused so much pain for his community \u2014 was the origin of the Murphy case and also resulted in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. Similarly, the truth of your ancestor, John Ridge, who signed a treaty that resulted in forced removal of the Cherokee people. It was against their wishes, and also what he thought he had to do to save his nation. How did you navigate that?

And I think the truth is complicated. I don\u2019t think we can tell the whole story of the <em>McGirt</em> victory without talking about the crimes and the tragedy that it originated in. And I think the same is true for my ancestors. I was sort of raised to think one thing, but I went back through the historical records and really tried to look at it for what it was.

Smith, High Country News <br />March 25, 2025</p> <p class=\"has-drop-cap\">During the forced<strong> </strong>removal of Muscogee (Creek) people from their ancestral lands in the Southeastern U.S., tribal members carried the embers and ashes of their town fires with them, determined to re-establish the flames in the new communities they planned to build in what\u2019s now known as Oklahoma. Those fires still burn today in places on the Muscogee Reservation.</p> <div class=\"wp-block-group alignright\"> <!-- RTT removed image (333291) --> <p class=\"has-text-align-left\"><em><em>By the Fire We Carry</em> </em><br />By Rebecca Nagle<br />352 pages, hardcover: $30<br />Harper, 2024.</p> </p></div> <p>In <em>By the Fire We Carry</em>, Cherokee journalist Rebecca Nagle documents the interwoven stories of tribal land dispossession, forced removal, a murder in a small tribal community, her own family history and three recent and consequential Supreme Court decisions about tribal jurisdiction over lands in Oklahoma. Two of them, <em>Murphy v. Oklahoma</em> and <em>McGirt v. Oklahoma, </em>centered on crimes on land that the state of Oklahoma argued was no longer part of the Muscogee and Cherokee Nations\u2019 respective reservations. In both cases, the Supreme Court upheld the tribes\u2019 arguments in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. But shortly after came <em>Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta</em>, in which the Supreme Court sidestepped a century of federal Indian law and gave states jurisdiction to prosecute crimes on tribal lands when the perpetrator was non-Native and the victim was Native. The connections Nagle makes span generations and offer insight into our current political turmoil, at a time when a second Trump administration is testing the limits of executive authority and the law.</p> <p>In a conversation with <em>High Country News</em>, Nagle discusses how the U.S. still wields its power of empire, what impact the Trump administration could have on tribal sovereignty, and the enduring weight of history.</p> <p><em>This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p> <p><strong><em>High Country News</em></strong>: <strong>In this book, you don\u2019t just focus on the 20-year histories of these three Supreme Court cases but also tell the stories of the Muscogee and Cherokee nations before the U.S. existed.

Smith, High Country NewsMarch 25, 2025<h1>Rebecca Nagle considers Supreme Court wins and what\u2019s at stake for tribes under Trump</h1> <p class=\"byline\">by Anna V. Smith, High Country News <br />March 25, 2025</p> <p class=\"has-drop-cap\">During the forced<strong> </strong>removal of Muscogee (Creek) people from their ancestral lands in the Southeastern U.S., tribal members carried the embers and ashes of their town fires with them, determined to re-establish the flames in the new communities they planned to build in what\u2019s now known as Oklahoma. Those fires still burn today in places on the Muscogee Reservation.</p> <div class=\"wp-block-group alignright\"> <!-- RTT removed image (333291) --> <p class=\"has-text-align-left\"><em><em>By the Fire We Carry</em> </em><br />By Rebecca Nagle<br />352 pages, hardcover: $30<br />Harper, 2024.</p> </p></div> <p>In <em>By the Fire We Carry</em>, Cherokee journalist Rebecca Nagle documents the interwoven stories of tribal land dispossession, forced removal, a murder in a small tribal community, her own family history and three recent and consequential Supreme Court decisions about tribal jurisdiction over lands in Oklahoma. Two of them, <em>Murphy v. Oklahoma</em> and <em>McGirt v. Oklahoma, </em>centered on crimes on land that the state of Oklahoma argued was no longer part of the Muscogee and Cherokee Nations\u2019 respective reservations. In both cases, the Supreme Court upheld the tribes\u2019 arguments in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. But shortly after came <em>Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta</em>, in which the Supreme Court sidestepped a century of federal Indian law and gave states jurisdiction to prosecute crimes on tribal lands when the perpetrator was non-Native and the victim was Native. The connections Nagle makes span generations and offer insight into our current political turmoil, at a time when a second Trump administration is testing the limits of executive authority and the law.</p> <p>In a conversation with <em>High Country News</em>, Nagle discusses how the U.S. still wields its power of empire, what impact the Trump administration could have on tribal sovereignty, and the enduring weight of history.</p> <p><em>This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p> <p><strong><em>High Country News</em></strong>: <strong>In this book, you don\u2019t just focus on the 20-year histories of these three Supreme Court cases but also tell the stories of the Muscogee and Cherokee nations before the U.S. existed.

Smith, High Country NewsMarch 25, 2025<h1>Rebecca Nagle considers Supreme Court wins and what\u2019s at stake for tribes under Trump</h1> <p class=\"byline\">by Anna V. Smith, High Country News <br />March 25, 2025</p> <p class=\"has-drop-cap\">During the forced<strong> </strong>removal of Muscogee (Creek) people from their ancestral lands in the Southeastern U.S., tribal members carried the embers and ashes of their town fires with them, determined to re-establish the flames in the new communities they planned to build in what\u2019s now known as Oklahoma. Those fires still burn today in places on the Muscogee Reservation.</p> <div class=\"wp-block-group alignright\"> <!-- RTT removed image (333291) --> <p class=\"has-text-align-left\"><em><em>By the Fire We Carry</em> </em><br />By Rebecca Nagle<br />352 pages, hardcover: $30<br />Harper, 2024.</p> </p></div> <p>In <em>By the Fire We Carry</em>, Cherokee journalist Rebecca Nagle documents the interwoven stories of tribal land dispossession, forced removal, a murder in a small tribal community, her own family history and three recent and consequential Supreme Court decisions about tribal jurisdiction over lands in Oklahoma. Two of them, <em>Murphy v. Oklahoma</em> and <em>McGirt v. Oklahoma, </em>centered on crimes on land that the state of Oklahoma argued was no longer part of the Muscogee and Cherokee Nations\u2019 respective reservations. In both cases, the Supreme Court upheld the tribes\u2019 arguments in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. But shortly after came <em>Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta</em>, in which the Supreme Court sidestepped a century of federal Indian law and gave states jurisdiction to prosecute crimes on tribal lands when the perpetrator was non-Native and the victim was Native. The connections Nagle makes span generations and offer insight into our current political turmoil, at a time when a second Trump administration is testing the limits of executive authority and the law.</p> <p>In a conversation with <em>High Country News</em>, Nagle discusses how the U.S. still wields its power of empire, what impact the Trump administration could have on tribal sovereignty, and the enduring weight of history.</p> <p><em>This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p> <p><strong><em>High Country News</em></strong>: <strong>In this book, you don\u2019t just focus on the 20-year histories of these three Supreme Court cases but also tell the stories of the Muscogee and Cherokee nations before the U.S. existed. Why did you decide to take such a long view?</strong></p> <p><strong>Rebecca Nagle:</strong> One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present. I also wanted people to get a sense of how history repeats itself, and how things like a lie that tribal land is lawless get used over and over again, or the excuse that, \u201cOh, <em>this</em> is actually what\u2019s best for Native people.\u201d I wanted people to be able to see and identify those patterns.&nbsp;</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present.</p> </blockquote> <p>When I found out about the <em>McGirt</em> decision and saw the implications that my tribe\u2019s reservation would be recognized again, it was a really overwhelming emotion of relief, of joy, but there was also a lot of sadness, because I knew how much my ancestors, and Cherokee ancestors in general, had sacrificed to reach this moment. I think that a lot of other tribal citizens felt that the day that we were celebrating the Supreme Court decision. I think we all felt that weight of history. And I wanted the reader to feel that weight of history \u2014 to understand this isn\u2019t a simple story of, \u201cYay, the tribes won!\u201d There\u2019s a lot that\u2019s implicated in that victory and a lot that was lost for that rare legal victory to happen.</p> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the book you hold multiple difficult truths at once, like how George Jacobs\u2019 death \u2014 which caused so much pain for his community \u2014 was the origin of the Murphy case and also resulted in a historic win for tribal sovereignty.

There\u2019s a lot that we can learn from the desperation of my ancestors and their decision to sign that treaty. We can learn just how violent U.S. policy was at that time, that they would make a decision like that. There\u2019s a cultural impulse to tell stories where there are clear heroes and clear villains, and victories like <em>McGirt</em> come from a good place, and things are clean-cut.

And I think the treatment of Indigenous nations is a glaring example of that, because we\u2019ve never had any kind of constitutional amendment or reform to change those laws and to change those policies. To dispossess Indigenous people of their land, the U.S. government gave itself a lot of power over people who are not U.S. citizens. That power of empire is embedded in our Constitution, because our country wanted to take Indigenous land. We still see it manifested in deportation and shutting down asylum and separating families at the border and banning Muslims from entering our country.

As a journalist, my North Star is the truth. And I think the truth is complicated. I don\u2019t think we can tell the whole story of theMcGirtvictory without talking about the crimes and the tragedy that it originated in. And I think the same is true for my ancestors. I was sort of raised to think one thing, but I went back through the historical records and really tried to look at it for what it was. There\u2019s a lot that we can learn from the desperation of my ancestors and their decision to sign that treaty. We can learn just how violent U.S. policy was at that time, that they would make a decision like that. There\u2019s a cultural impulse to tell stories where there are clear heroes and clear villains, and victories likeMcGirtcome from a good place, and things are clean-cut. I think that history is actually quite messy. I wanted a book that reflected that reality.Credit:Lauren CrowHCN:In the aftermath of the McGirt decision, the state of Oklahoma pushed a narrative of chaos and disruption in the criminal justice system, which some national outlets then repeated without much discernment.

Less than a fraction of a percent of the people staffing newsrooms are Native. Coverage of Indigenous issues very often fails to meet the standards of journalism. It doesn\u2019t have context, or a depth of knowledge of what\u2019s going on. They send reporters who\u2019ve never been on a reservation to do reporting about criminal justice on tribal land. It creates an environment where you can tell lies about tribes, and people will think that it\u2019s true.And unfortunately, that\u2019s what happened. In the wake ofMcGirt, (Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, R) made some very bold and outlandish claims about the number of criminal cases that could be prosecuted moving forward. I did some digging around with a fellow reporter, Allison Herrera, and Oklahoma\u2019s claims fell apart completely. But they were still repeated and cited by prominent outlets like theWashington PostandThe Wall Street Journal.Oklahoma then cited those articles in their briefs, and some of that inaccurate information was actually in the (Castro-Huerta) Supreme Court decision. And so it was this tornado of disinformation that made it all the way up to the Supreme Court.

Smith, High Country NewsMarch 25, 2025<h1>Rebecca Nagle considers Supreme Court wins and what\u2019s at stake for tribes under Trump</h1> <p class=\"byline\">by Anna V. Smith, High Country News <br />March 25, 2025</p> <p class=\"has-drop-cap\">During the forced<strong> </strong>removal of Muscogee (Creek) people from their ancestral lands in the Southeastern U.S., tribal members carried the embers and ashes of their town fires with them, determined to re-establish the flames in the new communities they planned to build in what\u2019s now known as Oklahoma. Those fires still burn today in places on the Muscogee Reservation.</p> <div class=\"wp-block-group alignright\"> <!-- RTT removed image (333291) --> <p class=\"has-text-align-left\"><em><em>By the Fire We Carry</em> </em><br />By Rebecca Nagle<br />352 pages, hardcover: $30<br />Harper, 2024.</p> </p></div> <p>In <em>By the Fire We Carry</em>, Cherokee journalist Rebecca Nagle documents the interwoven stories of tribal land dispossession, forced removal, a murder in a small tribal community, her own family history and three recent and consequential Supreme Court decisions about tribal jurisdiction over lands in Oklahoma. Two of them, <em>Murphy v. Oklahoma</em> and <em>McGirt v. Oklahoma, </em>centered on crimes on land that the state of Oklahoma argued was no longer part of the Muscogee and Cherokee Nations\u2019 respective reservations. In both cases, the Supreme Court upheld the tribes\u2019 arguments in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. But shortly after came <em>Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta</em>, in which the Supreme Court sidestepped a century of federal Indian law and gave states jurisdiction to prosecute crimes on tribal lands when the perpetrator was non-Native and the victim was Native. The connections Nagle makes span generations and offer insight into our current political turmoil, at a time when a second Trump administration is testing the limits of executive authority and the law.</p> <p>In a conversation with <em>High Country News</em>, Nagle discusses how the U.S. still wields its power of empire, what impact the Trump administration could have on tribal sovereignty, and the enduring weight of history.</p> <p><em>This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p> <p><strong><em>High Country News</em></strong>: <strong>In this book, you don\u2019t just focus on the 20-year histories of these three Supreme Court cases but also tell the stories of the Muscogee and Cherokee nations before the U.S. existed. Why did you decide to take such a long view?</strong></p> <p><strong>Rebecca Nagle:</strong> One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present. I also wanted people to get a sense of how history repeats itself, and how things like a lie that tribal land is lawless get used over and over again, or the excuse that, \u201cOh, <em>this</em> is actually what\u2019s best for Native people.\u201d I wanted people to be able to see and identify those patterns.&nbsp;</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present.</p> </blockquote> <p>When I found out about the <em>McGirt</em> decision and saw the implications that my tribe\u2019s reservation would be recognized again, it was a really overwhelming emotion of relief, of joy, but there was also a lot of sadness, because I knew how much my ancestors, and Cherokee ancestors in general, had sacrificed to reach this moment. I think that a lot of other tribal citizens felt that the day that we were celebrating the Supreme Court decision. I think we all felt that weight of history. And I wanted the reader to feel that weight of history \u2014 to understand this isn\u2019t a simple story of, \u201cYay, the tribes won!\u201d There\u2019s a lot that\u2019s implicated in that victory and a lot that was lost for that rare legal victory to happen.</p> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the book you hold multiple difficult truths at once, like how George Jacobs\u2019 death \u2014 which caused so much pain for his community \u2014 was the origin of the Murphy case and also resulted in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. Similarly, the truth of your ancestor, John Ridge, who signed a treaty that resulted in forced removal of the Cherokee people. It was against their wishes, and also what he thought he had to do to save his nation. How did you navigate that? It can be so easy to collapse these tensions to make for a simpler narrative.&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> Absolutely. As a journalist, my North Star is the truth.

Smith, High Country NewsMarch 25, 2025<h1>Rebecca Nagle considers Supreme Court wins and what\u2019s at stake for tribes under Trump</h1> <p class=\"byline\">by Anna V. Smith, High Country News <br />March 25, 2025</p> <p class=\"has-drop-cap\">During the forced<strong> </strong>removal of Muscogee (Creek) people from their ancestral lands in the Southeastern U.S., tribal members carried the embers and ashes of their town fires with them, determined to re-establish the flames in the new communities they planned to build in what\u2019s now known as Oklahoma. Those fires still burn today in places on the Muscogee Reservation.</p> <div class=\"wp-block-group alignright\"> <!-- RTT removed image (333291) --> <p class=\"has-text-align-left\"><em><em>By the Fire We Carry</em> </em><br />By Rebecca Nagle<br />352 pages, hardcover: $30<br />Harper, 2024.</p> </p></div> <p>In <em>By the Fire We Carry</em>, Cherokee journalist Rebecca Nagle documents the interwoven stories of tribal land dispossession, forced removal, a murder in a small tribal community, her own family history and three recent and consequential Supreme Court decisions about tribal jurisdiction over lands in Oklahoma. Two of them, <em>Murphy v. Oklahoma</em> and <em>McGirt v. Oklahoma, </em>centered on crimes on land that the state of Oklahoma argued was no longer part of the Muscogee and Cherokee Nations\u2019 respective reservations. In both cases, the Supreme Court upheld the tribes\u2019 arguments in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. But shortly after came <em>Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta</em>, in which the Supreme Court sidestepped a century of federal Indian law and gave states jurisdiction to prosecute crimes on tribal lands when the perpetrator was non-Native and the victim was Native. The connections Nagle makes span generations and offer insight into our current political turmoil, at a time when a second Trump administration is testing the limits of executive authority and the law.</p> <p>In a conversation with <em>High Country News</em>, Nagle discusses how the U.S. still wields its power of empire, what impact the Trump administration could have on tribal sovereignty, and the enduring weight of history.</p> <p><em>This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p> <p><strong><em>High Country News</em></strong>: <strong>In this book, you don\u2019t just focus on the 20-year histories of these three Supreme Court cases but also tell the stories of the Muscogee and Cherokee nations before the U.S. existed. Why did you decide to take such a long view?</strong></p> <p><strong>Rebecca Nagle:</strong> One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present. I also wanted people to get a sense of how history repeats itself, and how things like a lie that tribal land is lawless get used over and over again, or the excuse that, \u201cOh, <em>this</em> is actually what\u2019s best for Native people.\u201d I wanted people to be able to see and identify those patterns.&nbsp;</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present.</p> </blockquote> <p>When I found out about the <em>McGirt</em> decision and saw the implications that my tribe\u2019s reservation would be recognized again, it was a really overwhelming emotion of relief, of joy, but there was also a lot of sadness, because I knew how much my ancestors, and Cherokee ancestors in general, had sacrificed to reach this moment. I think that a lot of other tribal citizens felt that the day that we were celebrating the Supreme Court decision. I think we all felt that weight of history. And I wanted the reader to feel that weight of history \u2014 to understand this isn\u2019t a simple story of, \u201cYay, the tribes won!\u201d There\u2019s a lot that\u2019s implicated in that victory and a lot that was lost for that rare legal victory to happen.</p> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the book you hold multiple difficult truths at once, like how George Jacobs\u2019 death \u2014 which caused so much pain for his community \u2014 was the origin of the Murphy case and also resulted in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. Similarly, the truth of your ancestor, John Ridge, who signed a treaty that resulted in forced removal of the Cherokee people. It was against their wishes, and also what he thought he had to do to save his nation. How did you navigate that? It can be so easy to collapse these tensions to make for a simpler narrative.&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> Absolutely. As a journalist, my North Star is the truth. And I think the truth is complicated. I don\u2019t think we can tell the whole story of the <em>McGirt</em> victory without talking about the crimes and the tragedy that it originated in. And I think the same is true for my ancestors. I was sort of raised to think one thing, but I went back through the historical records and really tried to look at it for what it was. There\u2019s a lot that we can learn from the desperation of my ancestors and their decision to sign that treaty. We can learn just how violent U.S. policy was at that time, that they would make a decision like that. There\u2019s a cultural impulse to tell stories where there are clear heroes and clear villains, and victories like <em>McGirt</em> come from a good place, and things are clean-cut. I think that history is actually quite messy. I wanted a book that reflected that reality.</p> <!-- RTT removed image (333265) --> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the aftermath of the McGirt decision, the state of Oklahoma pushed a narrative of chaos and disruption in the criminal justice system, which some national outlets then repeated without much discernment. Can you talk about the role of the media \u2014 including the lack of Indigenous representation in newsrooms \u2014 and how that shapes the public\u2019s understanding of things like tribal sovereignty?</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> I think that it\u2019s a really big hindrance to our rights as Indigenous nations and to our sovereignty. Less than a fraction of a percent of the people staffing newsrooms are Native. Coverage of Indigenous issues very often fails to meet the standards of journalism. It doesn\u2019t have context, or a depth of knowledge of what\u2019s going on. They send reporters who\u2019ve never been on a reservation to do reporting about criminal justice on tribal land.

In the wake of <em>McGirt</em>, (Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, R) made some very bold and outlandish claims about the number of criminal cases that could be prosecuted moving forward. I did some digging around with a fellow reporter, Allison Herrera, and Oklahoma\u2019s claims fell apart completely. But they were still repeated and cited by prominent outlets like the <em>Washington Post</em> and <em>The Wall Street Journal.</em> Oklahoma then cited those articles in their briefs, and some of that inaccurate information was actually in the (<em>Castro-Huerta</em>) Supreme Court decision. And so it was this tornado of disinformation that made it all the way up to the Supreme Court. Normally, we think that the <em>Washington Post</em> is a check on bad information, but not when it comes to tribes, which should be an embarrassment for them.</p> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>We\u2019re in a moment of major law and policy change under a new administration.

And I think the treatment of Indigenous nations is a glaring example of that, because we\u2019ve never had any kind of constitutional amendment or reform to change those laws and to change those policies. To dispossess Indigenous people of their land, the U.S. government gave itself a lot of power over people who are not U.S. citizens. That power of empire is embedded in our Constitution, because our country wanted to take Indigenous land. We still see it manifested in deportation and shutting down asylum and separating families at the border and banning Muslims from entering our country. If we really don\u2019t want these types of policies to be enacted, there are some bigger questions about our democracy that as a society we haven\u2019t even begun to ask.</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p> If we really don\u2019t want these types of policies to be enacted, there are some bigger questions about our democracy that as a society we haven\u2019t even begun to ask.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>Given that, do you have any specific concerns about potential attacks on tribal sovereignty under a second Trump administration?</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> Everything has the capacity to get worse.

Even when the law is clearly on the tribe\u2019s side, courts have a very bad habit of bending and breaking the rules to satisfy the state or non-Native residents. One of the things that\u2019s really shocked me is how often our government institutions ignore the law when it comes to tribes and how hard tribes have to fight for just the law to be followed.

The remaking of the federal judiciary has a profound impact on tribes, because our cases are federal; they don\u2019t go through state court.

Smith, High Country NewsMarch 25, 2025<h1>Rebecca Nagle considers Supreme Court wins and what\u2019s at stake for tribes under Trump</h1> <p class=\"byline\">by Anna V. Smith, High Country News <br />March 25, 2025</p> <p class=\"has-drop-cap\">During the forced<strong> </strong>removal of Muscogee (Creek) people from their ancestral lands in the Southeastern U.S., tribal members carried the embers and ashes of their town fires with them, determined to re-establish the flames in the new communities they planned to build in what\u2019s now known as Oklahoma. Those fires still burn today in places on the Muscogee Reservation.</p> <div class=\"wp-block-group alignright\"> <!-- RTT removed image (333291) --> <p class=\"has-text-align-left\"><em><em>By the Fire We Carry</em> </em><br />By Rebecca Nagle<br />352 pages, hardcover: $30<br />Harper, 2024.</p> </p></div> <p>In <em>By the Fire We Carry</em>, Cherokee journalist Rebecca Nagle documents the interwoven stories of tribal land dispossession, forced removal, a murder in a small tribal community, her own family history and three recent and consequential Supreme Court decisions about tribal jurisdiction over lands in Oklahoma. Two of them, <em>Murphy v. Oklahoma</em> and <em>McGirt v. Oklahoma, </em>centered on crimes on land that the state of Oklahoma argued was no longer part of the Muscogee and Cherokee Nations\u2019 respective reservations. In both cases, the Supreme Court upheld the tribes\u2019 arguments in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. But shortly after came <em>Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta</em>, in which the Supreme Court sidestepped a century of federal Indian law and gave states jurisdiction to prosecute crimes on tribal lands when the perpetrator was non-Native and the victim was Native. The connections Nagle makes span generations and offer insight into our current political turmoil, at a time when a second Trump administration is testing the limits of executive authority and the law.</p> <p>In a conversation with <em>High Country News</em>, Nagle discusses how the U.S. still wields its power of empire, what impact the Trump administration could have on tribal sovereignty, and the enduring weight of history.</p> <p><em>This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p> <p><strong><em>High Country News</em></strong>: <strong>In this book, you don\u2019t just focus on the 20-year histories of these three Supreme Court cases but also tell the stories of the Muscogee and Cherokee nations before the U.S. existed. Why did you decide to take such a long view?</strong></p> <p><strong>Rebecca Nagle:</strong> One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present. I also wanted people to get a sense of how history repeats itself, and how things like a lie that tribal land is lawless get used over and over again, or the excuse that, \u201cOh, <em>this</em> is actually what\u2019s best for Native people.\u201d I wanted people to be able to see and identify those patterns.&nbsp;</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present.</p> </blockquote> <p>When I found out about the <em>McGirt</em> decision and saw the implications that my tribe\u2019s reservation would be recognized again, it was a really overwhelming emotion of relief, of joy, but there was also a lot of sadness, because I knew how much my ancestors, and Cherokee ancestors in general, had sacrificed to reach this moment. I think that a lot of other tribal citizens felt that the day that we were celebrating the Supreme Court decision. I think we all felt that weight of history. And I wanted the reader to feel that weight of history \u2014 to understand this isn\u2019t a simple story of, \u201cYay, the tribes won!\u201d There\u2019s a lot that\u2019s implicated in that victory and a lot that was lost for that rare legal victory to happen.</p> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the book you hold multiple difficult truths at once, like how George Jacobs\u2019 death \u2014 which caused so much pain for his community \u2014 was the origin of the Murphy case and also resulted in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. Similarly, the truth of your ancestor, John Ridge, who signed a treaty that resulted in forced removal of the Cherokee people. It was against their wishes, and also what he thought he had to do to save his nation. How did you navigate that? It can be so easy to collapse these tensions to make for a simpler narrative.&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> Absolutely. As a journalist, my North Star is the truth. And I think the truth is complicated. I don\u2019t think we can tell the whole story of the <em>McGirt</em> victory without talking about the crimes and the tragedy that it originated in. And I think the same is true for my ancestors. I was sort of raised to think one thing, but I went back through the historical records and really tried to look at it for what it was. There\u2019s a lot that we can learn from the desperation of my ancestors and their decision to sign that treaty. We can learn just how violent U.S. policy was at that time, that they would make a decision like that. There\u2019s a cultural impulse to tell stories where there are clear heroes and clear villains, and victories like <em>McGirt</em> come from a good place, and things are clean-cut. I think that history is actually quite messy. I wanted a book that reflected that reality.</p> <!-- RTT removed image (333265) --> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the aftermath of the McGirt decision, the state of Oklahoma pushed a narrative of chaos and disruption in the criminal justice system, which some national outlets then repeated without much discernment. Can you talk about the role of the media \u2014 including the lack of Indigenous representation in newsrooms \u2014 and how that shapes the public\u2019s understanding of things like tribal sovereignty?</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> I think that it\u2019s a really big hindrance to our rights as Indigenous nations and to our sovereignty. Less than a fraction of a percent of the people staffing newsrooms are Native. Coverage of Indigenous issues very often fails to meet the standards of journalism. It doesn\u2019t have context, or a depth of knowledge of what\u2019s going on. They send reporters who\u2019ve never been on a reservation to do reporting about criminal justice on tribal land. It creates an environment where you can tell lies about tribes, and people will think that it\u2019s true.</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> </blockquote> <p>And unfortunately, that\u2019s what happened.

There\u2019s a lot that we can learn from the desperation of my ancestors and their decision to sign that treaty. We can learn just how violent U.S. policy was at that time, that they would make a decision like that. There\u2019s a cultural impulse to tell stories where there are clear heroes and clear villains, and victories like <em>McGirt</em> come from a good place, and things are clean-cut.

Smith, High Country NewsMarch 25, 2025<h1>Rebecca Nagle considers Supreme Court wins and what\u2019s at stake for tribes under Trump</h1> <p class=\"byline\">by Anna V. Smith, High Country News <br />March 25, 2025</p> <p class=\"has-drop-cap\">During the forced<strong> </strong>removal of Muscogee (Creek) people from their ancestral lands in the Southeastern U.S., tribal members carried the embers and ashes of their town fires with them, determined to re-establish the flames in the new communities they planned to build in what\u2019s now known as Oklahoma. Those fires still burn today in places on the Muscogee Reservation.</p> <div class=\"wp-block-group alignright\"> <!-- RTT removed image (333291) --> <p class=\"has-text-align-left\"><em><em>By the Fire We Carry</em> </em><br />By Rebecca Nagle<br />352 pages, hardcover: $30<br />Harper, 2024.</p> </p></div> <p>In <em>By the Fire We Carry</em>, Cherokee journalist Rebecca Nagle documents the interwoven stories of tribal land dispossession, forced removal, a murder in a small tribal community, her own family history and three recent and consequential Supreme Court decisions about tribal jurisdiction over lands in Oklahoma. Two of them, <em>Murphy v. Oklahoma</em> and <em>McGirt v. Oklahoma, </em>centered on crimes on land that the state of Oklahoma argued was no longer part of the Muscogee and Cherokee Nations\u2019 respective reservations. In both cases, the Supreme Court upheld the tribes\u2019 arguments in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. But shortly after came <em>Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta</em>, in which the Supreme Court sidestepped a century of federal Indian law and gave states jurisdiction to prosecute crimes on tribal lands when the perpetrator was non-Native and the victim was Native. The connections Nagle makes span generations and offer insight into our current political turmoil, at a time when a second Trump administration is testing the limits of executive authority and the law.</p> <p>In a conversation with <em>High Country News</em>, Nagle discusses how the U.S. still wields its power of empire, what impact the Trump administration could have on tribal sovereignty, and the enduring weight of history.</p> <p><em>This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p> <p><strong><em>High Country News</em></strong>: <strong>In this book, you don\u2019t just focus on the 20-year histories of these three Supreme Court cases but also tell the stories of the Muscogee and Cherokee nations before the U.S. existed. Why did you decide to take such a long view?</strong></p> <p><strong>Rebecca Nagle:</strong> One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present. I also wanted people to get a sense of how history repeats itself, and how things like a lie that tribal land is lawless get used over and over again, or the excuse that, \u201cOh, <em>this</em> is actually what\u2019s best for Native people.\u201d I wanted people to be able to see and identify those patterns.&nbsp;</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present.</p> </blockquote> <p>When I found out about the <em>McGirt</em> decision and saw the implications that my tribe\u2019s reservation would be recognized again, it was a really overwhelming emotion of relief, of joy, but there was also a lot of sadness, because I knew how much my ancestors, and Cherokee ancestors in general, had sacrificed to reach this moment. I think that a lot of other tribal citizens felt that the day that we were celebrating the Supreme Court decision. I think we all felt that weight of history. And I wanted the reader to feel that weight of history \u2014 to understand this isn\u2019t a simple story of, \u201cYay, the tribes won!\u201d There\u2019s a lot that\u2019s implicated in that victory and a lot that was lost for that rare legal victory to happen.</p> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the book you hold multiple difficult truths at once, like how George Jacobs\u2019 death \u2014 which caused so much pain for his community \u2014 was the origin of the Murphy case and also resulted in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. Similarly, the truth of your ancestor, John Ridge, who signed a treaty that resulted in forced removal of the Cherokee people. It was against their wishes, and also what he thought he had to do to save his nation. How did you navigate that? It can be so easy to collapse these tensions to make for a simpler narrative.&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> Absolutely. As a journalist, my North Star is the truth. And I think the truth is complicated. I don\u2019t think we can tell the whole story of the <em>McGirt</em> victory without talking about the crimes and the tragedy that it originated in. And I think the same is true for my ancestors. I was sort of raised to think one thing, but I went back through the historical records and really tried to look at it for what it was.

Why did you decide to take such a long view?</strong></p> <p><strong>Rebecca Nagle:</strong> One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present. I also wanted people to get a sense of how history repeats itself, and how things like a lie that tribal land is lawless get used over and over again, or the excuse that, \u201cOh, <em>this</em> is actually what\u2019s best for Native people.\u201d I wanted people to be able to see and identify those patterns.&nbsp;</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present.</p> </blockquote> <p>When I found out about the <em>McGirt</em> decision and saw the implications that my tribe\u2019s reservation would be recognized again, it was a really overwhelming emotion of relief, of joy, but there was also a lot of sadness, because I knew how much my ancestors, and Cherokee ancestors in general, had sacrificed to reach this moment. I think that a lot of other tribal citizens felt that the day that we were celebrating the Supreme Court decision. I think we all felt that weight of history. And I wanted the reader to feel that weight of history \u2014 to understand this isn\u2019t a simple story of, \u201cYay, the tribes won!\u201d There\u2019s a lot that\u2019s implicated in that victory and a lot that was lost for that rare legal victory to happen.</p> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the book you hold multiple difficult truths at once, like how George Jacobs\u2019 death \u2014 which caused so much pain for his community \u2014 was the origin of the Murphy case and also resulted in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. Similarly, the truth of your ancestor, John Ridge, who signed a treaty that resulted in forced removal of the Cherokee people. It was against their wishes, and also what he thought he had to do to save his nation. How did you navigate that? It can be so easy to collapse these tensions to make for a simpler narrative.&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> Absolutely. As a journalist, my North Star is the truth. And I think the truth is complicated. I don\u2019t think we can tell the whole story of the <em>McGirt</em> victory without talking about the crimes and the tragedy that it originated in. And I think the same is true for my ancestors. I was sort of raised to think one thing, but I went back through the historical records and really tried to look at it for what it was. There\u2019s a lot that we can learn from the desperation of my ancestors and their decision to sign that treaty. We can learn just how violent U.S. policy was at that time, that they would make a decision like that. There\u2019s a cultural impulse to tell stories where there are clear heroes and clear villains, and victories like <em>McGirt</em> come from a good place, and things are clean-cut. I think that history is actually quite messy. I wanted a book that reflected that reality.</p> <!-- RTT removed image (333265) --> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the aftermath of the McGirt decision, the state of Oklahoma pushed a narrative of chaos and disruption in the criminal justice system, which some national outlets then repeated without much discernment. Can you talk about the role of the media \u2014 including the lack of Indigenous representation in newsrooms \u2014 and how that shapes the public\u2019s understanding of things like tribal sovereignty?</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> I think that it\u2019s a really big hindrance to our rights as Indigenous nations and to our sovereignty. Less than a fraction of a percent of the people staffing newsrooms are Native. Coverage of Indigenous issues very often fails to meet the standards of journalism. It doesn\u2019t have context, or a depth of knowledge of what\u2019s going on. They send reporters who\u2019ve never been on a reservation to do reporting about criminal justice on tribal land. It creates an environment where you can tell lies about tribes, and people will think that it\u2019s true.</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> </blockquote> <p>And unfortunately, that\u2019s what happened. In the wake of <em>McGirt</em>, (Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, R) made some very bold and outlandish claims about the number of criminal cases that could be prosecuted moving forward. I did some digging around with a fellow reporter, Allison Herrera, and Oklahoma\u2019s claims fell apart completely. But they were still repeated and cited by prominent outlets like the <em>Washington Post</em> and <em>The Wall Street Journal.</em> Oklahoma then cited those articles in their briefs, and some of that inaccurate information was actually in the (<em>Castro-Huerta</em>) Supreme Court decision. And so it was this tornado of disinformation that made it all the way up to the Supreme Court. Normally, we think that the <em>Washington Post</em> is a check on bad information, but not when it comes to tribes, which should be an embarrassment for them.</p> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>We\u2019re in a moment of major law and policy change under a new administration. What are some lessons from your reporting that apply to our current moment?</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> We talk about it as a problem that originates with Trump, instead of a problem that originates with some of the flaws in our democracy. And I think the treatment of Indigenous nations is a glaring example of that, because we\u2019ve never had any kind of constitutional amendment or reform to change those laws and to change those policies. To dispossess Indigenous people of their land, the U.S. government gave itself a lot of power over people who are not U.S. citizens. That power of empire is embedded in our Constitution, because our country wanted to take Indigenous land. We still see it manifested in deportation and shutting down asylum and separating families at the border and banning Muslims from entering our country. If we really don\u2019t want these types of policies to be enacted, there are some bigger questions about our democracy that as a society we haven\u2019t even begun to ask.</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p> If we really don\u2019t want these types of policies to be enacted, there are some bigger questions about our democracy that as a society we haven\u2019t even begun to ask.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>Given that, do you have any specific concerns about potential attacks on tribal sovereignty under a second Trump administration?</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> Everything has the capacity to get worse. A lot of tribal programs, whether it\u2019s (the Indian Health Service) or tribal courts, tribal law enforcement, rely on federal dollars. There\u2019s a lot specifically at stake for tribes under Trump. The remaking of the federal judiciary has a profound impact on tribes, because our cases are federal; they don\u2019t go through state court. And, unfortunately, the courts \u2014 dating back to before Trump \u2014 have not been reliable sources for justice for tribes. Even when the law is clearly on the tribe\u2019s side, courts have a very bad habit of bending and breaking the rules to satisfy the state or non-Native residents. One of the things that\u2019s really shocked me is how often our government institutions ignore the law when it comes to tribes and how hard tribes have to fight for just the law to be followed.

Smith, High Country News <br />March 25, 2025</p> <p class=\"has-drop-cap\">During the forced<strong> </strong>removal of Muscogee (Creek) people from their ancestral lands in the Southeastern U.S., tribal members carried the embers and ashes of their town fires with them, determined to re-establish the flames in the new communities they planned to build in what\u2019s now known as Oklahoma. Those fires still burn today in places on the Muscogee Reservation.</p> <div class=\"wp-block-group alignright\"> <!-- RTT removed image (333291) --> <p class=\"has-text-align-left\"><em><em>By the Fire We Carry</em> </em><br />By Rebecca Nagle<br />352 pages, hardcover: $30<br />Harper, 2024.</p> </p></div> <p>In <em>By the Fire We Carry</em>, Cherokee journalist Rebecca Nagle documents the interwoven stories of tribal land dispossession, forced removal, a murder in a small tribal community, her own family history and three recent and consequential Supreme Court decisions about tribal jurisdiction over lands in Oklahoma. Two of them, <em>Murphy v. Oklahoma</em> and <em>McGirt v. Oklahoma, </em>centered on crimes on land that the state of Oklahoma argued was no longer part of the Muscogee and Cherokee Nations\u2019 respective reservations. In both cases, the Supreme Court upheld the tribes\u2019 arguments in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. But shortly after came <em>Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta</em>, in which the Supreme Court sidestepped a century of federal Indian law and gave states jurisdiction to prosecute crimes on tribal lands when the perpetrator was non-Native and the victim was Native. The connections Nagle makes span generations and offer insight into our current political turmoil, at a time when a second Trump administration is testing the limits of executive authority and the law.</p> <p>In a conversation with <em>High Country News</em>, Nagle discusses how the U.S. still wields its power of empire, what impact the Trump administration could have on tribal sovereignty, and the enduring weight of history.</p> <p><em>This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p> <p><strong><em>High Country News</em></strong>: <strong>In this book, you don\u2019t just focus on the 20-year histories of these three Supreme Court cases but also tell the stories of the Muscogee and Cherokee nations before the U.S. existed.

Why did you decide to take such a long view?Rebecca Nagle:One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present. I also wanted people to get a sense of how history repeats itself, and how things like a lie that tribal land is lawless get used over and over again, or the excuse that, \u201cOh,thisis actually what\u2019s best for Native people.\u201d I wanted people to be able to see and identify those patterns.One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present.When I found out about theMcGirtdecision and saw the implications that my tribe\u2019s reservation would be recognized again, it was a really overwhelming emotion of relief, of joy, but there was also a lot of sadness, because I knew how much my ancestors, and Cherokee ancestors in general, had sacrificed to reach this moment. I think that a lot of other tribal citizens felt that the day that we were celebrating the Supreme Court decision. I think we all felt that weight of history. And I wanted the reader to feel that weight of history \u2014 to understand this isn\u2019t a simple story of, \u201cYay, the tribes won!\u201d There\u2019s a lot that\u2019s implicated in that victory and a lot that was lost for that rare legal victory to happen.HCN:In the book you hold multiple difficult truths at once, like how George Jacobs\u2019 death \u2014 which caused so much pain for his community \u2014 was the origin of the Murphy case and also resulted in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. Similarly, the truth of your ancestor, John Ridge, who signed a treaty that resulted in forced removal of the Cherokee people. It was against their wishes, and also what he thought he had to do to save his nation. How did you navigate that? It can be so easy to collapse these tensions to make for a simpler narrative.RN:Absolutely. As a journalist, my North Star is the truth. And I think the truth is complicated. I don\u2019t think we can tell the whole story of theMcGirtvictory without talking about the crimes and the tragedy that it originated in. And I think the same is true for my ancestors. I was sort of raised to think one thing, but I went back through the historical records and really tried to look at it for what it was. There\u2019s a lot that we can learn from the desperation of my ancestors and their decision to sign that treaty. We can learn just how violent U.S. policy was at that time, that they would make a decision like that. There\u2019s a cultural impulse to tell stories where there are clear heroes and clear villains, and victories likeMcGirtcome from a good place, and things are clean-cut. I think that history is actually quite messy. I wanted a book that reflected that reality.Credit:Lauren CrowHCN:In the aftermath of the McGirt decision, the state of Oklahoma pushed a narrative of chaos and disruption in the criminal justice system, which some national outlets then repeated without much discernment. Can you talk about the role of the media \u2014 including the lack of Indigenous representation in newsrooms \u2014 and how that shapes the public\u2019s understanding of things like tribal sovereignty?RN:I think that it\u2019s a really big hindrance to our rights as Indigenous nations and to our sovereignty. Less than a fraction of a percent of the people staffing newsrooms are Native. Coverage of Indigenous issues very often fails to meet the standards of journalism. It doesn\u2019t have context, or a depth of knowledge of what\u2019s going on. They send reporters who\u2019ve never been on a reservation to do reporting about criminal justice on tribal land. It creates an environment where you can tell lies about tribes, and people will think that it\u2019s true.And unfortunately, that\u2019s what happened. In the wake ofMcGirt, (Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, R) made some very bold and outlandish claims about the number of criminal cases that could be prosecuted moving forward. I did some digging around with a fellow reporter, Allison Herrera, and Oklahoma\u2019s claims fell apart completely. But they were still repeated and cited by prominent outlets like theWashington PostandThe Wall Street Journal.Oklahoma then cited those articles in their briefs, and some of that inaccurate information was actually in the (Castro-Huerta) Supreme Court decision. And so it was this tornado of disinformation that made it all the way up to the Supreme Court. Normally, we think that theWashington Postis a check on bad information, but not when it comes to tribes, which should be an embarrassment for them.HCN:We\u2019re in a moment of major law and policy change under a new administration.

Smith, High Country NewsMarch 25, 2025<h1>Rebecca Nagle considers Supreme Court wins and what\u2019s at stake for tribes under Trump</h1> <p class=\"byline\">by Anna V. Smith, High Country News <br />March 25, 2025</p> <p class=\"has-drop-cap\">During the forced<strong> </strong>removal of Muscogee (Creek) people from their ancestral lands in the Southeastern U.S., tribal members carried the embers and ashes of their town fires with them, determined to re-establish the flames in the new communities they planned to build in what\u2019s now known as Oklahoma. Those fires still burn today in places on the Muscogee Reservation.</p> <div class=\"wp-block-group alignright\"> <!-- RTT removed image (333291) --> <p class=\"has-text-align-left\"><em><em>By the Fire We Carry</em> </em><br />By Rebecca Nagle<br />352 pages, hardcover: $30<br />Harper, 2024.</p> </p></div> <p>In <em>By the Fire We Carry</em>, Cherokee journalist Rebecca Nagle documents the interwoven stories of tribal land dispossession, forced removal, a murder in a small tribal community, her own family history and three recent and consequential Supreme Court decisions about tribal jurisdiction over lands in Oklahoma. Two of them, <em>Murphy v. Oklahoma</em> and <em>McGirt v. Oklahoma, </em>centered on crimes on land that the state of Oklahoma argued was no longer part of the Muscogee and Cherokee Nations\u2019 respective reservations. In both cases, the Supreme Court upheld the tribes\u2019 arguments in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. But shortly after came <em>Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta</em>, in which the Supreme Court sidestepped a century of federal Indian law and gave states jurisdiction to prosecute crimes on tribal lands when the perpetrator was non-Native and the victim was Native. The connections Nagle makes span generations and offer insight into our current political turmoil, at a time when a second Trump administration is testing the limits of executive authority and the law.</p> <p>In a conversation with <em>High Country News</em>, Nagle discusses how the U.S. still wields its power of empire, what impact the Trump administration could have on tribal sovereignty, and the enduring weight of history.</p> <p><em>This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p> <p><strong><em>High Country News</em></strong>: <strong>In this book, you don\u2019t just focus on the 20-year histories of these three Supreme Court cases but also tell the stories of the Muscogee and Cherokee nations before the U.S. existed.

Smith, High Country News <br />March 25, 2025</p> <p class=\"has-drop-cap\">During the forced<strong> </strong>removal of Muscogee (Creek) people from their ancestral lands in the Southeastern U.S., tribal members carried the embers and ashes of their town fires with them, determined to re-establish the flames in the new communities they planned to build in what\u2019s now known as Oklahoma. Those fires still burn today in places on the Muscogee Reservation.</p> <div class=\"wp-block-group alignright\"> <!-- RTT removed image (333291) --> <p class=\"has-text-align-left\"><em><em>By the Fire We Carry</em> </em><br />By Rebecca Nagle<br />352 pages, hardcover: $30<br />Harper, 2024.</p> </p></div> <p>In <em>By the Fire We Carry</em>, Cherokee journalist Rebecca Nagle documents the interwoven stories of tribal land dispossession, forced removal, a murder in a small tribal community, her own family history and three recent and consequential Supreme Court decisions about tribal jurisdiction over lands in Oklahoma. Two of them, <em>Murphy v. Oklahoma</em> and <em>McGirt v. Oklahoma, </em>centered on crimes on land that the state of Oklahoma argued was no longer part of the Muscogee and Cherokee Nations\u2019 respective reservations. In both cases, the Supreme Court upheld the tribes\u2019 arguments in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. But shortly after came <em>Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta</em>, in which the Supreme Court sidestepped a century of federal Indian law and gave states jurisdiction to prosecute crimes on tribal lands when the perpetrator was non-Native and the victim was Native. The connections Nagle makes span generations and offer insight into our current political turmoil, at a time when a second Trump administration is testing the limits of executive authority and the law.</p> <p>In a conversation with <em>High Country News</em>, Nagle discusses how the U.S. still wields its power of empire, what impact the Trump administration could have on tribal sovereignty, and the enduring weight of history.</p> <p><em>This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p> <p><strong><em>High Country News</em></strong>: <strong>In this book, you don\u2019t just focus on the 20-year histories of these three Supreme Court cases but also tell the stories of the Muscogee and Cherokee nations before the U.S. existed. Why did you decide to take such a long view?</strong></p> <p><strong>Rebecca Nagle:</strong> One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present. I also wanted people to get a sense of how history repeats itself, and how things like a lie that tribal land is lawless get used over and over again, or the excuse that, \u201cOh, <em>this</em> is actually what\u2019s best for Native people.\u201d I wanted people to be able to see and identify those patterns.&nbsp;</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present.</p> </blockquote> <p>When I found out about the <em>McGirt</em> decision and saw the implications that my tribe\u2019s reservation would be recognized again, it was a really overwhelming emotion of relief, of joy, but there was also a lot of sadness, because I knew how much my ancestors, and Cherokee ancestors in general, had sacrificed to reach this moment. I think that a lot of other tribal citizens felt that the day that we were celebrating the Supreme Court decision. I think we all felt that weight of history. And I wanted the reader to feel that weight of history \u2014 to understand this isn\u2019t a simple story of, \u201cYay, the tribes won!\u201d There\u2019s a lot that\u2019s implicated in that victory and a lot that was lost for that rare legal victory to happen.</p> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the book you hold multiple difficult truths at once, like how George Jacobs\u2019 death \u2014 which caused so much pain for his community \u2014 was the origin of the Murphy case and also resulted in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. Similarly, the truth of your ancestor, John Ridge, who signed a treaty that resulted in forced removal of the Cherokee people.

And I think the truth is complicated. I don\u2019t think we can tell the whole story of the <em>McGirt</em> victory without talking about the crimes and the tragedy that it originated in. And I think the same is true for my ancestors. I was sort of raised to think one thing, but I went back through the historical records and really tried to look at it for what it was. There\u2019s a lot that we can learn from the desperation of my ancestors and their decision to sign that treaty. We can learn just how violent U.S. policy was at that time, that they would make a decision like that. There\u2019s a cultural impulse to tell stories where there are clear heroes and clear villains, and victories like <em>McGirt</em> come from a good place, and things are clean-cut. I think that history is actually quite messy. I wanted a book that reflected that reality.</p> <!-- RTT removed image (333265) --> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the aftermath of the McGirt decision, the state of Oklahoma pushed a narrative of chaos and disruption in the criminal justice system, which some national outlets then repeated without much discernment.

Less than a fraction of a percent of the people staffing newsrooms are Native. Coverage of Indigenous issues very often fails to meet the standards of journalism.

Smith, High Country NewsMarch 25, 2025<h1>Rebecca Nagle considers Supreme Court wins and what\u2019s at stake for tribes under Trump</h1> <p class=\"byline\">by Anna V. Smith, High Country News <br />March 25, 2025</p> <p class=\"has-drop-cap\">During the forced<strong> </strong>removal of Muscogee (Creek) people from their ancestral lands in the Southeastern U.S., tribal members carried the embers and ashes of their town fires with them, determined to re-establish the flames in the new communities they planned to build in what\u2019s now known as Oklahoma. Those fires still burn today in places on the Muscogee Reservation.</p> <div class=\"wp-block-group alignright\"> <!-- RTT removed image (333291) --> <p class=\"has-text-align-left\"><em><em>By the Fire We Carry</em> </em><br />By Rebecca Nagle<br />352 pages, hardcover: $30<br />Harper, 2024.</p> </p></div> <p>In <em>By the Fire We Carry</em>, Cherokee journalist Rebecca Nagle documents the interwoven stories of tribal land dispossession, forced removal, a murder in a small tribal community, her own family history and three recent and consequential Supreme Court decisions about tribal jurisdiction over lands in Oklahoma. Two of them, <em>Murphy v. Oklahoma</em> and <em>McGirt v. Oklahoma, </em>centered on crimes on land that the state of Oklahoma argued was no longer part of the Muscogee and Cherokee Nations\u2019 respective reservations. In both cases, the Supreme Court upheld the tribes\u2019 arguments in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. But shortly after came <em>Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta</em>, in which the Supreme Court sidestepped a century of federal Indian law and gave states jurisdiction to prosecute crimes on tribal lands when the perpetrator was non-Native and the victim was Native. The connections Nagle makes span generations and offer insight into our current political turmoil, at a time when a second Trump administration is testing the limits of executive authority and the law.</p> <p>In a conversation with <em>High Country News</em>, Nagle discusses how the U.S. still wields its power of empire, what impact the Trump administration could have on tribal sovereignty, and the enduring weight of history.</p> <p><em>This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p> <p><strong><em>High Country News</em></strong>: <strong>In this book, you don\u2019t just focus on the 20-year histories of these three Supreme Court cases but also tell the stories of the Muscogee and Cherokee nations before the U.S. existed.

Similarly, the truth of your ancestor, John Ridge, who signed a treaty that resulted in forced removal of the Cherokee people. It was against their wishes, and also what he thought he had to do to save his nation. How did you navigate that? It can be so easy to collapse these tensions to make for a simpler narrative.RN:Absolutely. As a journalist, my North Star is the truth. And I think the truth is complicated. I don\u2019t think we can tell the whole story of theMcGirtvictory without talking about the crimes and the tragedy that it originated in. And I think the same is true for my ancestors. I was sort of raised to think one thing, but I went back through the historical records and really tried to look at it for what it was. There\u2019s a lot that we can learn from the desperation of my ancestors and their decision to sign that treaty. We can learn just how violent U.S. policy was at that time, that they would make a decision like that. There\u2019s a cultural impulse to tell stories where there are clear heroes and clear villains, and victories likeMcGirtcome from a good place, and things are clean-cut. I think that history is actually quite messy. I wanted a book that reflected that reality.Credit:Lauren CrowHCN:In the aftermath of the McGirt decision, the state of Oklahoma pushed a narrative of chaos and disruption in the criminal justice system, which some national outlets then repeated without much discernment. Can you talk about the role of the media \u2014 including the lack of Indigenous representation in newsrooms \u2014 and how that shapes the public\u2019s understanding of things like tribal sovereignty?RN:I think that it\u2019s a really big hindrance to our rights as Indigenous nations and to our sovereignty. Less than a fraction of a percent of the people staffing newsrooms are Native. Coverage of Indigenous issues very often fails to meet the standards of journalism. It doesn\u2019t have context, or a depth of knowledge of what\u2019s going on. They send reporters who\u2019ve never been on a reservation to do reporting about criminal justice on tribal land. It creates an environment where you can tell lies about tribes, and people will think that it\u2019s true.And unfortunately, that\u2019s what happened. In the wake ofMcGirt, (Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, R) made some very bold and outlandish claims about the number of criminal cases that could be prosecuted moving forward. I did some digging around with a fellow reporter, Allison Herrera, and Oklahoma\u2019s claims fell apart completely. But they were still repeated and cited by prominent outlets like theWashington PostandThe Wall Street Journal.Oklahoma then cited those articles in their briefs, and some of that inaccurate information was actually in the (Castro-Huerta) Supreme Court decision. And so it was this tornado of disinformation that made it all the way up to the Supreme Court. Normally, we think that theWashington Postis a check on bad information, but not when it comes to tribes, which should be an embarrassment for them.HCN:We\u2019re in a moment of major law and policy change under a new administration.

A lot of tribal programs, whether it\u2019s (the Indian Health Service) or tribal courts, tribal law enforcement, rely on federal dollars. There\u2019s a lot specifically at stake for tribes under Trump. The remaking of the federal judiciary has a profound impact on tribes, because our cases are federal; they don\u2019t go through state court. And, unfortunately, the courts \u2014 dating back to before Trump \u2014 have not been reliable sources for justice for tribes. Even when the law is clearly on the tribe\u2019s side, courts have a very bad habit of bending and breaking the rules to satisfy the state or non-Native residents. One of the things that\u2019s really shocked me is how often our government institutions ignore the law when it comes to tribes and how hard tribes have to fight for just the law to be followed.

Smith, High Country NewsMarch 25, 2025<h1>Rebecca Nagle considers Supreme Court wins and what\u2019s at stake for tribes under Trump</h1> <p class=\"byline\">by Anna V. Smith, High Country News <br />March 25, 2025</p> <p class=\"has-drop-cap\">During the forced<strong> </strong>removal of Muscogee (Creek) people from their ancestral lands in the Southeastern U.S., tribal members carried the embers and ashes of their town fires with them, determined to re-establish the flames in the new communities they planned to build in what\u2019s now known as Oklahoma. Those fires still burn today in places on the Muscogee Reservation.</p> <div class=\"wp-block-group alignright\"> <!-- RTT removed image (333291) --> <p class=\"has-text-align-left\"><em><em>By the Fire We Carry</em> </em><br />By Rebecca Nagle<br />352 pages, hardcover: $30<br />Harper, 2024.</p> </p></div> <p>In <em>By the Fire We Carry</em>, Cherokee journalist Rebecca Nagle documents the interwoven stories of tribal land dispossession, forced removal, a murder in a small tribal community, her own family history and three recent and consequential Supreme Court decisions about tribal jurisdiction over lands in Oklahoma. Two of them, <em>Murphy v. Oklahoma</em> and <em>McGirt v. Oklahoma, </em>centered on crimes on land that the state of Oklahoma argued was no longer part of the Muscogee and Cherokee Nations\u2019 respective reservations. In both cases, the Supreme Court upheld the tribes\u2019 arguments in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. But shortly after came <em>Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta</em>, in which the Supreme Court sidestepped a century of federal Indian law and gave states jurisdiction to prosecute crimes on tribal lands when the perpetrator was non-Native and the victim was Native. The connections Nagle makes span generations and offer insight into our current political turmoil, at a time when a second Trump administration is testing the limits of executive authority and the law.</p> <p>In a conversation with <em>High Country News</em>, Nagle discusses how the U.S. still wields its power of empire, what impact the Trump administration could have on tribal sovereignty, and the enduring weight of history.</p> <p><em>This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p> <p><strong><em>High Country News</em></strong>: <strong>In this book, you don\u2019t just focus on the 20-year histories of these three Supreme Court cases but also tell the stories of the Muscogee and Cherokee nations before the U.S. existed. Why did you decide to take such a long view?</strong></p> <p><strong>Rebecca Nagle:</strong> One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present. I also wanted people to get a sense of how history repeats itself, and how things like a lie that tribal land is lawless get used over and over again, or the excuse that, \u201cOh, <em>this</em> is actually what\u2019s best for Native people.\u201d I wanted people to be able to see and identify those patterns.&nbsp;</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present.</p> </blockquote> <p>When I found out about the <em>McGirt</em> decision and saw the implications that my tribe\u2019s reservation would be recognized again, it was a really overwhelming emotion of relief, of joy, but there was also a lot of sadness, because I knew how much my ancestors, and Cherokee ancestors in general, had sacrificed to reach this moment. I think that a lot of other tribal citizens felt that the day that we were celebrating the Supreme Court decision. I think we all felt that weight of history. And I wanted the reader to feel that weight of history \u2014 to understand this isn\u2019t a simple story of, \u201cYay, the tribes won!\u201d There\u2019s a lot that\u2019s implicated in that victory and a lot that was lost for that rare legal victory to happen.</p> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the book you hold multiple difficult truths at once, like how George Jacobs\u2019 death \u2014 which caused so much pain for his community \u2014 was the origin of the Murphy case and also resulted in a historic win for tribal sovereignty.

Smith, High Country NewsMarch 25, 2025<h1>Rebecca Nagle considers Supreme Court wins and what\u2019s at stake for tribes under Trump</h1> <p class=\"byline\">by Anna V. Smith, High Country News <br />March 25, 2025</p> <p class=\"has-drop-cap\">During the forced<strong> </strong>removal of Muscogee (Creek) people from their ancestral lands in the Southeastern U.S., tribal members carried the embers and ashes of their town fires with them, determined to re-establish the flames in the new communities they planned to build in what\u2019s now known as Oklahoma. Those fires still burn today in places on the Muscogee Reservation.</p> <div class=\"wp-block-group alignright\"> <!-- RTT removed image (333291) --> <p class=\"has-text-align-left\"><em><em>By the Fire We Carry</em> </em><br />By Rebecca Nagle<br />352 pages, hardcover: $30<br />Harper, 2024.</p> </p></div> <p>In <em>By the Fire We Carry</em>, Cherokee journalist Rebecca Nagle documents the interwoven stories of tribal land dispossession, forced removal, a murder in a small tribal community, her own family history and three recent and consequential Supreme Court decisions about tribal jurisdiction over lands in Oklahoma. Two of them, <em>Murphy v. Oklahoma</em> and <em>McGirt v. Oklahoma, </em>centered on crimes on land that the state of Oklahoma argued was no longer part of the Muscogee and Cherokee Nations\u2019 respective reservations. In both cases, the Supreme Court upheld the tribes\u2019 arguments in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. But shortly after came <em>Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta</em>, in which the Supreme Court sidestepped a century of federal Indian law and gave states jurisdiction to prosecute crimes on tribal lands when the perpetrator was non-Native and the victim was Native. The connections Nagle makes span generations and offer insight into our current political turmoil, at a time when a second Trump administration is testing the limits of executive authority and the law.</p> <p>In a conversation with <em>High Country News</em>, Nagle discusses how the U.S. still wields its power of empire, what impact the Trump administration could have on tribal sovereignty, and the enduring weight of history.</p> <p><em>This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p> <p><strong><em>High Country News</em></strong>: <strong>In this book, you don\u2019t just focus on the 20-year histories of these three Supreme Court cases but also tell the stories of the Muscogee and Cherokee nations before the U.S. existed. Why did you decide to take such a long view?</strong></p> <p><strong>Rebecca Nagle:</strong> One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present. I also wanted people to get a sense of how history repeats itself, and how things like a lie that tribal land is lawless get used over and over again, or the excuse that, \u201cOh, <em>this</em> is actually what\u2019s best for Native people.\u201d I wanted people to be able to see and identify those patterns.&nbsp;</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present.</p> </blockquote> <p>When I found out about the <em>McGirt</em> decision and saw the implications that my tribe\u2019s reservation would be recognized again, it was a really overwhelming emotion of relief, of joy, but there was also a lot of sadness, because I knew how much my ancestors, and Cherokee ancestors in general, had sacrificed to reach this moment. I think that a lot of other tribal citizens felt that the day that we were celebrating the Supreme Court decision. I think we all felt that weight of history. And I wanted the reader to feel that weight of history \u2014 to understand this isn\u2019t a simple story of, \u201cYay, the tribes won!\u201d There\u2019s a lot that\u2019s implicated in that victory and a lot that was lost for that rare legal victory to happen.</p> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the book you hold multiple difficult truths at once, like how George Jacobs\u2019 death \u2014 which caused so much pain for his community \u2014 was the origin of the Murphy case and also resulted in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. Similarly, the truth of your ancestor, John Ridge, who signed a treaty that resulted in forced removal of the Cherokee people. It was against their wishes, and also what he thought he had to do to save his nation. How did you navigate that? It can be so easy to collapse these tensions to make for a simpler narrative.&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> Absolutely. As a journalist, my North Star is the truth. And I think the truth is complicated. I don\u2019t think we can tell the whole story of the <em>McGirt</em> victory without talking about the crimes and the tragedy that it originated in. And I think the same is true for my ancestors. I was sort of raised to think one thing, but I went back through the historical records and really tried to look at it for what it was. There\u2019s a lot that we can learn from the desperation of my ancestors and their decision to sign that treaty. We can learn just how violent U.S. policy was at that time, that they would make a decision like that. There\u2019s a cultural impulse to tell stories where there are clear heroes and clear villains, and victories like <em>McGirt</em> come from a good place, and things are clean-cut. I think that history is actually quite messy. I wanted a book that reflected that reality.</p> <!-- RTT removed image (333265) --> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the aftermath of the McGirt decision, the state of Oklahoma pushed a narrative of chaos and disruption in the criminal justice system, which some national outlets then repeated without much discernment.

Less than a fraction of a percent of the people staffing newsrooms are Native. Coverage of Indigenous issues very often fails to meet the standards of journalism. It doesn\u2019t have context, or a depth of knowledge of what\u2019s going on. They send reporters who\u2019ve never been on a reservation to do reporting about criminal justice on tribal land.

But they were still repeated and cited by prominent outlets like the <em>Washington Post</em> and <em>The Wall Street Journal.</em> Oklahoma then cited those articles in their briefs, and some of that inaccurate information was actually in the (<em>Castro-Huerta</em>) Supreme Court decision.

And I think the treatment of Indigenous nations is a glaring example of that, because we\u2019ve never had any kind of constitutional amendment or reform to change those laws and to change those policies. To dispossess Indigenous people of their land, the U.S. government gave itself a lot of power over people who are not U.S. citizens. That power of empire is embedded in our Constitution, because our country wanted to take Indigenous land. We still see it manifested in deportation and shutting down asylum and separating families at the border and banning Muslims from entering our country. If we really don\u2019t want these types of policies to be enacted, there are some bigger questions about our democracy that as a society we haven\u2019t even begun to ask.</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p> If we really don\u2019t want these types of policies to be enacted, there are some bigger questions about our democracy that as a society we haven\u2019t even begun to ask.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>Given that, do you have any specific concerns about potential attacks on tribal sovereignty under a second Trump administration?</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> Everything has the capacity to get worse.

One of the things that\u2019s really shocked me is how often our government institutions ignore the law when it comes to tribes and how hard tribes have to fight for just the law to be followed.

Two of them, <em>Murphy v. Oklahoma</em> and <em>McGirt v. Oklahoma, </em>centered on crimes on land that the state of Oklahoma argued was no longer part of the Muscogee and Cherokee Nations\u2019 respective reservations. In both cases, the Supreme Court upheld the tribes\u2019 arguments in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. But shortly after came <em>Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta</em>, in which the Supreme Court sidestepped a century of federal Indian law and gave states jurisdiction to prosecute crimes on tribal lands when the perpetrator was non-Native and the victim was Native.

The remaking of the federal judiciary has a profound impact on tribes, because our cases are federal; they don\u2019t go through state court.

Smith, High Country NewsMarch 25, 2025<h1>Rebecca Nagle considers Supreme Court wins and what\u2019s at stake for tribes under Trump</h1> <p class=\"byline\">by Anna V. Smith, High Country News <br />March 25, 2025</p> <p class=\"has-drop-cap\">During the forced<strong> </strong>removal of Muscogee (Creek) people from their ancestral lands in the Southeastern U.S., tribal members carried the embers and ashes of their town fires with them, determined to re-establish the flames in the new communities they planned to build in what\u2019s now known as Oklahoma. Those fires still burn today in places on the Muscogee Reservation.</p> <div class=\"wp-block-group alignright\"> <!-- RTT removed image (333291) --> <p class=\"has-text-align-left\"><em><em>By the Fire We Carry</em> </em><br />By Rebecca Nagle<br />352 pages, hardcover: $30<br />Harper, 2024.</p> </p></div> <p>In <em>By the Fire We Carry</em>, Cherokee journalist Rebecca Nagle documents the interwoven stories of tribal land dispossession, forced removal, a murder in a small tribal community, her own family history and three recent and consequential Supreme Court decisions about tribal jurisdiction over lands in Oklahoma. Two of them, <em>Murphy v. Oklahoma</em> and <em>McGirt v. Oklahoma, </em>centered on crimes on land that the state of Oklahoma argued was no longer part of the Muscogee and Cherokee Nations\u2019 respective reservations. In both cases, the Supreme Court upheld the tribes\u2019 arguments in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. But shortly after came <em>Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta</em>, in which the Supreme Court sidestepped a century of federal Indian law and gave states jurisdiction to prosecute crimes on tribal lands when the perpetrator was non-Native and the victim was Native. The connections Nagle makes span generations and offer insight into our current political turmoil, at a time when a second Trump administration is testing the limits of executive authority and the law.</p> <p>In a conversation with <em>High Country News</em>, Nagle discusses how the U.S. still wields its power of empire, what impact the Trump administration could have on tribal sovereignty, and the enduring weight of history.</p> <p><em>This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p> <p><strong><em>High Country News</em></strong>: <strong>In this book, you don\u2019t just focus on the 20-year histories of these three Supreme Court cases but also tell the stories of the Muscogee and Cherokee nations before the U.S. existed. Why did you decide to take such a long view?</strong></p> <p><strong>Rebecca Nagle:</strong> One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present. I also wanted people to get a sense of how history repeats itself, and how things like a lie that tribal land is lawless get used over and over again, or the excuse that, \u201cOh, <em>this</em> is actually what\u2019s best for Native people.\u201d I wanted people to be able to see and identify those patterns.&nbsp;</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present.</p> </blockquote> <p>When I found out about the <em>McGirt</em> decision and saw the implications that my tribe\u2019s reservation would be recognized again, it was a really overwhelming emotion of relief, of joy, but there was also a lot of sadness, because I knew how much my ancestors, and Cherokee ancestors in general, had sacrificed to reach this moment. I think that a lot of other tribal citizens felt that the day that we were celebrating the Supreme Court decision. I think we all felt that weight of history. And I wanted the reader to feel that weight of history \u2014 to understand this isn\u2019t a simple story of, \u201cYay, the tribes won!\u201d There\u2019s a lot that\u2019s implicated in that victory and a lot that was lost for that rare legal victory to happen.</p> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the book you hold multiple difficult truths at once, like how George Jacobs\u2019 death \u2014 which caused so much pain for his community \u2014 was the origin of the Murphy case and also resulted in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. Similarly, the truth of your ancestor, John Ridge, who signed a treaty that resulted in forced removal of the Cherokee people. It was against their wishes, and also what he thought he had to do to save his nation. How did you navigate that? It can be so easy to collapse these tensions to make for a simpler narrative.&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> Absolutely. As a journalist, my North Star is the truth. And I think the truth is complicated. I don\u2019t think we can tell the whole story of the <em>McGirt</em> victory without talking about the crimes and the tragedy that it originated in. And I think the same is true for my ancestors. I was sort of raised to think one thing, but I went back through the historical records and really tried to look at it for what it was. There\u2019s a lot that we can learn from the desperation of my ancestors and their decision to sign that treaty. We can learn just how violent U.S. policy was at that time, that they would make a decision like that. There\u2019s a cultural impulse to tell stories where there are clear heroes and clear villains, and victories like <em>McGirt</em> come from a good place, and things are clean-cut. I think that history is actually quite messy. I wanted a book that reflected that reality.</p> <!-- RTT removed image (333265) --> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the aftermath of the McGirt decision, the state of Oklahoma pushed a narrative of chaos and disruption in the criminal justice system, which some national outlets then repeated without much discernment. Can you talk about the role of the media \u2014 including the lack of Indigenous representation in newsrooms \u2014 and how that shapes the public\u2019s understanding of things like tribal sovereignty?</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> I think that it\u2019s a really big hindrance to our rights as Indigenous nations and to our sovereignty.

And I think the truth is complicated. I don\u2019t think we can tell the whole story of the <em>McGirt</em> victory without talking about the crimes and the tragedy that it originated in. And I think the same is true for my ancestors. I was sort of raised to think one thing, but I went back through the historical records and really tried to look at it for what it was. There\u2019s a lot that we can learn from the desperation of my ancestors and their decision to sign that treaty. We can learn just how violent U.S. policy was at that time, that they would make a decision like that. There\u2019s a cultural impulse to tell stories where there are clear heroes and clear villains, and victories like <em>McGirt</em> come from a good place, and things are clean-cut.

Less than a fraction of a percent of the people staffing newsrooms are Native. Coverage of Indigenous issues very often fails to meet the standards of journalism. It doesn\u2019t have context, or a depth of knowledge of what\u2019s going on. They send reporters who\u2019ve never been on a reservation to do reporting about criminal justice on tribal land.

But they were still repeated and cited by prominent outlets like the <em>Washington Post</em> and <em>The Wall Street Journal.</em> Oklahoma then cited those articles in their briefs, and some of that inaccurate information was actually in the (<em>Castro-Huerta</em>) Supreme Court decision.

Smith, High Country NewsMarch 25, 2025<h1>Rebecca Nagle considers Supreme Court wins and what\u2019s at stake for tribes under Trump</h1> <p class=\"byline\">by Anna V. Smith, High Country News <br />March 25, 2025</p> <p class=\"has-drop-cap\">During the forced<strong> </strong>removal of Muscogee (Creek) people from their ancestral lands in the Southeastern U.S., tribal members carried the embers and ashes of their town fires with them, determined to re-establish the flames in the new communities they planned to build in what\u2019s now known as Oklahoma. Those fires still burn today in places on the Muscogee Reservation.</p> <div class=\"wp-block-group alignright\"> <!-- RTT removed image (333291) --> <p class=\"has-text-align-left\"><em><em>By the Fire We Carry</em> </em><br />By Rebecca Nagle<br />352 pages, hardcover: $30<br />Harper, 2024.</p> </p></div> <p>In <em>By the Fire We Carry</em>, Cherokee journalist Rebecca Nagle documents the interwoven stories of tribal land dispossession, forced removal, a murder in a small tribal community, her own family history and three recent and consequential Supreme Court decisions about tribal jurisdiction over lands in Oklahoma. Two of them, <em>Murphy v. Oklahoma</em> and <em>McGirt v. Oklahoma, </em>centered on crimes on land that the state of Oklahoma argued was no longer part of the Muscogee and Cherokee Nations\u2019 respective reservations. In both cases, the Supreme Court upheld the tribes\u2019 arguments in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. But shortly after came <em>Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta</em>, in which the Supreme Court sidestepped a century of federal Indian law and gave states jurisdiction to prosecute crimes on tribal lands when the perpetrator was non-Native and the victim was Native. The connections Nagle makes span generations and offer insight into our current political turmoil, at a time when a second Trump administration is testing the limits of executive authority and the law.</p> <p>In a conversation with <em>High Country News</em>, Nagle discusses how the U.S. still wields its power of empire, what impact the Trump administration could have on tribal sovereignty, and the enduring weight of history.</p> <p><em>This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p> <p><strong><em>High Country News</em></strong>: <strong>In this book, you don\u2019t just focus on the 20-year histories of these three Supreme Court cases but also tell the stories of the Muscogee and Cherokee nations before the U.S. existed. Why did you decide to take such a long view?</strong></p> <p><strong>Rebecca Nagle:</strong> One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present. I also wanted people to get a sense of how history repeats itself, and how things like a lie that tribal land is lawless get used over and over again, or the excuse that, \u201cOh, <em>this</em> is actually what\u2019s best for Native people.\u201d I wanted people to be able to see and identify those patterns.&nbsp;</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present.</p> </blockquote> <p>When I found out about the <em>McGirt</em> decision and saw the implications that my tribe\u2019s reservation would be recognized again, it was a really overwhelming emotion of relief, of joy, but there was also a lot of sadness, because I knew how much my ancestors, and Cherokee ancestors in general, had sacrificed to reach this moment.

Smith, High Country NewsMarch 25, 2025<h1>Rebecca Nagle considers Supreme Court wins and what\u2019s at stake for tribes under Trump</h1> <p class=\"byline\">by Anna V. Smith, High Country News <br />March 25, 2025</p> <p class=\"has-drop-cap\">During the forced<strong> </strong>removal of Muscogee (Creek) people from their ancestral lands in the Southeastern U.S., tribal members carried the embers and ashes of their town fires with them, determined to re-establish the flames in the new communities they planned to build in what\u2019s now known as Oklahoma. Those fires still burn today in places on the Muscogee Reservation.</p> <div class=\"wp-block-group alignright\"> <!-- RTT removed image (333291) --> <p class=\"has-text-align-left\"><em><em>By the Fire We Carry</em> </em><br />By Rebecca Nagle<br />352 pages, hardcover: $30<br />Harper, 2024.</p> </p></div> <p>In <em>By the Fire We Carry</em>, Cherokee journalist Rebecca Nagle documents the interwoven stories of tribal land dispossession, forced removal, a murder in a small tribal community, her own family history and three recent and consequential Supreme Court decisions about tribal jurisdiction over lands in Oklahoma. Two of them, <em>Murphy v. Oklahoma</em> and <em>McGirt v. Oklahoma, </em>centered on crimes on land that the state of Oklahoma argued was no longer part of the Muscogee and Cherokee Nations\u2019 respective reservations. In both cases, the Supreme Court upheld the tribes\u2019 arguments in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. But shortly after came <em>Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta</em>, in which the Supreme Court sidestepped a century of federal Indian law and gave states jurisdiction to prosecute crimes on tribal lands when the perpetrator was non-Native and the victim was Native. The connections Nagle makes span generations and offer insight into our current political turmoil, at a time when a second Trump administration is testing the limits of executive authority and the law.</p> <p>In a conversation with <em>High Country News</em>, Nagle discusses how the U.S. still wields its power of empire, what impact the Trump administration could have on tribal sovereignty, and the enduring weight of history.</p> <p><em>This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p> <p><strong><em>High Country News</em></strong>: <strong>In this book, you don\u2019t just focus on the 20-year histories of these three Supreme Court cases but also tell the stories of the Muscogee and Cherokee nations before the U.S. existed. Why did you decide to take such a long view?</strong></p> <p><strong>Rebecca Nagle:</strong> One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present. I also wanted people to get a sense of how history repeats itself, and how things like a lie that tribal land is lawless get used over and over again, or the excuse that, \u201cOh, <em>this</em> is actually what\u2019s best for Native people.\u201d I wanted people to be able to see and identify those patterns.&nbsp;</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present.</p> </blockquote> <p>When I found out about the <em>McGirt</em> decision and saw the implications that my tribe\u2019s reservation would be recognized again, it was a really overwhelming emotion of relief, of joy, but there was also a lot of sadness, because I knew how much my ancestors, and Cherokee ancestors in general, had sacrificed to reach this moment. I think that a lot of other tribal citizens felt that the day that we were celebrating the Supreme Court decision. I think we all felt that weight of history. And I wanted the reader to feel that weight of history \u2014 to understand this isn\u2019t a simple story of, \u201cYay, the tribes won!\u201d There\u2019s a lot that\u2019s implicated in that victory and a lot that was lost for that rare legal victory to happen.</p> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the book you hold multiple difficult truths at once, like how George Jacobs\u2019 death \u2014 which caused so much pain for his community \u2014 was the origin of the Murphy case and also resulted in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. Similarly, the truth of your ancestor, John Ridge, who signed a treaty that resulted in forced removal of the Cherokee people. It was against their wishes, and also what he thought he had to do to save his nation. How did you navigate that? It can be so easy to collapse these tensions to make for a simpler narrative.&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> Absolutely. As a journalist, my North Star is the truth. And I think the truth is complicated. I don\u2019t think we can tell the whole story of the <em>McGirt</em> victory without talking about the crimes and the tragedy that it originated in. And I think the same is true for my ancestors. I was sort of raised to think one thing, but I went back through the historical records and really tried to look at it for what it was. There\u2019s a lot that we can learn from the desperation of my ancestors and their decision to sign that treaty. We can learn just how violent U.S. policy was at that time, that they would make a decision like that. There\u2019s a cultural impulse to tell stories where there are clear heroes and clear villains, and victories like <em>McGirt</em> come from a good place, and things are clean-cut. I think that history is actually quite messy. I wanted a book that reflected that reality.</p> <!-- RTT removed image (333265) --> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the aftermath of the McGirt decision, the state of Oklahoma pushed a narrative of chaos and disruption in the criminal justice system, which some national outlets then repeated without much discernment. Can you talk about the role of the media \u2014 including the lack of Indigenous representation in newsrooms \u2014 and how that shapes the public\u2019s understanding of things like tribal sovereignty?</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> I think that it\u2019s a really big hindrance to our rights as Indigenous nations and to our sovereignty. Less than a fraction of a percent of the people staffing newsrooms are Native. Coverage of Indigenous issues very often fails to meet the standards of journalism. It doesn\u2019t have context, or a depth of knowledge of what\u2019s going on. They send reporters who\u2019ve never been on a reservation to do reporting about criminal justice on tribal land. It creates an environment where you can tell lies about tribes, and people will think that it\u2019s true.</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> </blockquote> <p>And unfortunately, that\u2019s what happened. In the wake of <em>McGirt</em>, (Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, R) made some very bold and outlandish claims about the number of criminal cases that could be prosecuted moving forward. I did some digging around with a fellow reporter, Allison Herrera, and Oklahoma\u2019s claims fell apart completely. But they were still repeated and cited by prominent outlets like the <em>Washington Post</em> and <em>The Wall Street Journal.</em> Oklahoma then cited those articles in their briefs, and some of that inaccurate information was actually in the (<em>Castro-Huerta</em>) Supreme Court decision. And so it was this tornado of disinformation that made it all the way up to the Supreme Court. Normally, we think that the <em>Washington Post</em> is a check on bad information, but not when it comes to tribes, which should be an embarrassment for them.</p> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>We\u2019re in a moment of major law and policy change under a new administration. What are some lessons from your reporting that apply to our current moment?</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> We talk about it as a problem that originates with Trump, instead of a problem that originates with some of the flaws in our democracy. And I think the treatment of Indigenous nations is a glaring example of that, because we\u2019ve never had any kind of constitutional amendment or reform to change those laws and to change those policies. To dispossess Indigenous people of their land, the U.S. government gave itself a lot of power over people who are not U.S. citizens. That power of empire is embedded in our Constitution, because our country wanted to take Indigenous land. We still see it manifested in deportation and shutting down asylum and separating families at the border and banning Muslims from entering our country. If we really don\u2019t want these types of policies to be enacted, there are some bigger questions about our democracy that as a society we haven\u2019t even begun to ask.</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p> If we really don\u2019t want these types of policies to be enacted, there are some bigger questions about our democracy that as a society we haven\u2019t even begun to ask.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>Given that, do you have any specific concerns about potential attacks on tribal sovereignty under a second Trump administration?</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> Everything has the capacity to get worse.

There\u2019s a lot specifically at stake for tribes under Trump. The remaking of the federal judiciary has a profound impact on tribes, because our cases are federal; they don\u2019t go through state court. And, unfortunately, the courts \u2014 dating back to before Trump \u2014 have not been reliable sources for justice for tribes. Even when the law is clearly on the tribe\u2019s side, courts have a very bad habit of bending and breaking the rules to satisfy the state or non-Native residents. One of the things that\u2019s really shocked me is how often our government institutions ignore the law when it comes to tribes and how hard tribes have to fight for just the law to be followed.

Smith, High Country NewsMarch 25, 2025<h1>Rebecca Nagle considers Supreme Court wins and what\u2019s at stake for tribes under Trump</h1> <p class=\"byline\">by Anna V. Smith, High Country News <br />March 25, 2025</p> <p class=\"has-drop-cap\">During the forced<strong> </strong>removal of Muscogee (Creek) people from their ancestral lands in the Southeastern U.S., tribal members carried the embers and ashes of their town fires with them, determined to re-establish the flames in the new communities they planned to build in what\u2019s now known as Oklahoma. Those fires still burn today in places on the Muscogee Reservation.</p> <div class=\"wp-block-group alignright\"> <!-- RTT removed image (333291) --> <p class=\"has-text-align-left\"><em><em>By the Fire We Carry</em> </em><br />By Rebecca Nagle<br />352 pages, hardcover: $30<br />Harper, 2024.</p> </p></div> <p>In <em>By the Fire We Carry</em>, Cherokee journalist Rebecca Nagle documents the interwoven stories of tribal land dispossession, forced removal, a murder in a small tribal community, her own family history and three recent and consequential Supreme Court decisions about tribal jurisdiction over lands in Oklahoma. Two of them, <em>Murphy v. Oklahoma</em> and <em>McGirt v. Oklahoma, </em>centered on crimes on land that the state of Oklahoma argued was no longer part of the Muscogee and Cherokee Nations\u2019 respective reservations. In both cases, the Supreme Court upheld the tribes\u2019 arguments in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. But shortly after came <em>Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta</em>, in which the Supreme Court sidestepped a century of federal Indian law and gave states jurisdiction to prosecute crimes on tribal lands when the perpetrator was non-Native and the victim was Native. The connections Nagle makes span generations and offer insight into our current political turmoil, at a time when a second Trump administration is testing the limits of executive authority and the law.</p> <p>In a conversation with <em>High Country News</em>, Nagle discusses how the U.S. still wields its power of empire, what impact the Trump administration could have on tribal sovereignty, and the enduring weight of history.</p> <p><em>This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p> <p><strong><em>High Country News</em></strong>: <strong>In this book, you don\u2019t just focus on the 20-year histories of these three Supreme Court cases but also tell the stories of the Muscogee and Cherokee nations before the U.S. existed. Why did you decide to take such a long view?</strong></p> <p><strong>Rebecca Nagle:</strong> One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present. I also wanted people to get a sense of how history repeats itself, and how things like a lie that tribal land is lawless get used over and over again, or the excuse that, \u201cOh, <em>this</em> is actually what\u2019s best for Native people.\u201d I wanted people to be able to see and identify those patterns.&nbsp;</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present.</p> </blockquote> <p>When I found out about the <em>McGirt</em> decision and saw the implications that my tribe\u2019s reservation would be recognized again, it was a really overwhelming emotion of relief, of joy, but there was also a lot of sadness, because I knew how much my ancestors, and Cherokee ancestors in general, had sacrificed to reach this moment. I think that a lot of other tribal citizens felt that the day that we were celebrating the Supreme Court decision. I think we all felt that weight of history. And I wanted the reader to feel that weight of history \u2014 to understand this isn\u2019t a simple story of, \u201cYay, the tribes won!\u201d There\u2019s a lot that\u2019s implicated in that victory and a lot that was lost for that rare legal victory to happen.</p> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the book you hold multiple difficult truths at once, like how George Jacobs\u2019 death \u2014 which caused so much pain for his community \u2014 was the origin of the Murphy case and also resulted in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. Similarly, the truth of your ancestor, John Ridge, who signed a treaty that resulted in forced removal of the Cherokee people. It was against their wishes, and also what he thought he had to do to save his nation. How did you navigate that? It can be so easy to collapse these tensions to make for a simpler narrative.&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> Absolutely. As a journalist, my North Star is the truth. And I think the truth is complicated. I don\u2019t think we can tell the whole story of the <em>McGirt</em> victory without talking about the crimes and the tragedy that it originated in. And I think the same is true for my ancestors. I was sort of raised to think one thing, but I went back through the historical records and really tried to look at it for what it was. There\u2019s a lot that we can learn from the desperation of my ancestors and their decision to sign that treaty. We can learn just how violent U.S. policy was at that time, that they would make a decision like that. There\u2019s a cultural impulse to tell stories where there are clear heroes and clear villains, and victories like <em>McGirt</em> come from a good place, and things are clean-cut. I think that history is actually quite messy. I wanted a book that reflected that reality.</p> <!-- RTT removed image (333265) --> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the aftermath of the McGirt decision, the state of Oklahoma pushed a narrative of chaos and disruption in the criminal justice system, which some national outlets then repeated without much discernment. Can you talk about the role of the media \u2014 including the lack of Indigenous representation in newsrooms \u2014 and how that shapes the public\u2019s understanding of things like tribal sovereignty?</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> I think that it\u2019s a really big hindrance to our rights as Indigenous nations and to our sovereignty. Less than a fraction of a percent of the people staffing newsrooms are Native. Coverage of Indigenous issues very often fails to meet the standards of journalism. It doesn\u2019t have context, or a depth of knowledge of what\u2019s going on. They send reporters who\u2019ve never been on a reservation to do reporting about criminal justice on tribal land. It creates an environment where you can tell lies about tribes, and people will think that it\u2019s true.</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> </blockquote> <p>And unfortunately, that\u2019s what happened. In the wake of <em>McGirt</em>, (Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, R) made some very bold and outlandish claims about the number of criminal cases that could be prosecuted moving forward. I did some digging around with a fellow reporter, Allison Herrera, and Oklahoma\u2019s claims fell apart completely. But they were still repeated and cited by prominent outlets like the <em>Washington Post</em> and <em>The Wall Street Journal.</em> Oklahoma then cited those articles in their briefs, and some of that inaccurate information was actually in the (<em>Castro-Huerta</em>) Supreme Court decision. And so it was this tornado of disinformation that made it all the way up to the Supreme Court. Normally, we think that the <em>Washington Post</em> is a check on bad information, but not when it comes to tribes, which should be an embarrassment for them.</p> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>We\u2019re in a moment of major law and policy change under a new administration. What are some lessons from your reporting that apply to our current moment?</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> We talk about it as a problem that originates with Trump, instead of a problem that originates with some of the flaws in our democracy. And I think the treatment of Indigenous nations is a glaring example of that, because we\u2019ve never had any kind of constitutional amendment or reform to change those laws and to change those policies. To dispossess Indigenous people of their land, the U.S. government gave itself a lot of power over people who are not U.S. citizens. That power of empire is embedded in our Constitution, because our country wanted to take Indigenous land. We still see it manifested in deportation and shutting down asylum and separating families at the border and banning Muslims from entering our country. If we really don\u2019t want these types of policies to be enacted, there are some bigger questions about our democracy that as a society we haven\u2019t even begun to ask.</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p> If we really don\u2019t want these types of policies to be enacted, there are some bigger questions about our democracy that as a society we haven\u2019t even begun to ask.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>Given that, do you have any specific concerns about potential attacks on tribal sovereignty under a second Trump administration?</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> Everything has the capacity to get worse. A lot of tribal programs, whether it\u2019s (the Indian Health Service) or tribal courts, tribal law enforcement, rely on federal dollars. There\u2019s a lot specifically at stake for tribes under Trump. The remaking of the federal judiciary has a profound impact on tribes, because our cases are federal; they don\u2019t go through state court. And, unfortunately, the courts \u2014 dating back to before Trump \u2014 have not been reliable sources for justice for tribes. Even when the law is clearly on the tribe\u2019s side, courts have a very bad habit of bending and breaking the rules to satisfy the state or non-Native residents. One of the things that\u2019s really shocked me is how often our government institutions ignore the law when it comes to tribes and how hard tribes have to fight for just the law to be followed. Those weaknesses in our democracy have been there for a long time.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p> <p><em>We welcome reader letters.

Smith, High Country NewsMarch 25, 2025 This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.High Country News:In this book, you don\u2019t just focus on the 20-year histories of these three Supreme Court cases but also tell the stories of the Muscogee and Cherokee nations before the U.S. existed. Why did you decide to take such a long view?Rebecca Nagle:One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present. I also wanted people to get a sense of how history repeats itself, and how things like a lie that tribal land is lawless get used over and over again, or the excuse that, \u201cOh,thisis actually what\u2019s best for Native people.\u201d I wanted people to be able to see and identify those patterns.One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present.When I found out about theMcGirtdecision and saw the implications that my tribe\u2019s reservation would be recognized again, it was a really overwhelming emotion of relief, of joy, but there was also a lot of sadness, because I knew how much my ancestors, and Cherokee ancestors in general, had sacrificed to reach this moment. I think that a lot of other tribal citizens felt that the day that we were celebrating the Supreme Court decision. I think we all felt that weight of history. And I wanted the reader to feel that weight of history \u2014 to understand this isn\u2019t a simple story of, \u201cYay, the tribes won!\u201d There\u2019s a lot that\u2019s implicated in that victory and a lot that was lost for that rare legal victory to happen.HCN:In the book you hold multiple difficult truths at once, like how George Jacobs\u2019 death \u2014 which caused so much pain for his community \u2014 was the origin of the Murphy case and also resulted in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. Similarly, the truth of your ancestor, John Ridge, who signed a treaty that resulted in forced removal of the Cherokee people. It was against their wishes, and also what he thought he had to do to save his nation. How did you navigate that? It can be so easy to collapse these tensions to make for a simpler narrative.RN:Absolutely. As a journalist, my North Star is the truth. And I think the truth is complicated. I don\u2019t think we can tell the whole story of theMcGirtvictory without talking about the crimes and the tragedy that it originated in. And I think the same is true for my ancestors. I was sort of raised to think one thing, but I went back through the historical records and really tried to look at it for what it was. There\u2019s a lot that we can learn from the desperation of my ancestors and their decision to sign that treaty. We can learn just how violent U.S. policy was at that time, that they would make a decision like that. There\u2019s a cultural impulse to tell stories where there are clear heroes and clear villains, and victories likeMcGirtcome from a good place, and things are clean-cut. I think that history is actually quite messy. I wanted a book that reflected that reality.Credit:Lauren CrowHCN:In the aftermath of the McGirt decision, the state of Oklahoma pushed a narrative of chaos and disruption in the criminal justice system, which some national outlets then repeated without much discernment. Can you talk about the role of the media \u2014 including the lack of Indigenous representation in newsrooms \u2014 and how that shapes the public\u2019s understanding of things like tribal sovereignty?RN:I think that it\u2019s a really big hindrance to our rights as Indigenous nations and to our sovereignty. Less than a fraction of a percent of the people staffing newsrooms are Native. Coverage of Indigenous issues very often fails to meet the standards of journalism. It doesn\u2019t have context, or a depth of knowledge of what\u2019s going on. They send reporters who\u2019ve never been on a reservation to do reporting about criminal justice on tribal land. It creates an environment where you can tell lies about tribes, and people will think that it\u2019s true.And unfortunately, that\u2019s what happened. In the wake ofMcGirt, (Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, R) made some very bold and outlandish claims about the number of criminal cases that could be prosecuted moving forward. I did some digging around with a fellow reporter, Allison Herrera, and Oklahoma\u2019s claims fell apart completely. But they were still repeated and cited by prominent outlets like theWashington PostandThe Wall Street Journal.Oklahoma then cited those articles in their briefs, and some of that inaccurate information was actually in the (Castro-Huerta) Supreme Court decision. And so it was this tornado of disinformation that made it all the way up to the Supreme Court. Normally, we think that theWashington Postis a check on bad information, but not when it comes to tribes, which should be an embarrassment for them.HCN:We\u2019re in a moment of major law and policy change under a new administration.

And I think the treatment of Indigenous nations is a glaring example of that, because we\u2019ve never had any kind of constitutional amendment or reform to change those laws and to change those policies. To dispossess Indigenous people of their land, the U.S. government gave itself a lot of power over people who are not U.S. citizens. That power of empire is embedded in our Constitution, because our country wanted to take Indigenous land. We still see it manifested in deportation and shutting down asylum and separating families at the border and banning Muslims from entering our country.

A lot of tribal programs, whether it\u2019s (the Indian Health Service) or tribal courts, tribal law enforcement, rely on federal dollars.

The remaking of the federal judiciary has a profound impact on tribes, because our cases are federal; they don\u2019t go through state court. And, unfortunately, the courts \u2014 dating back to before Trump \u2014 have not been reliable sources for justice for tribes. Even when the law is clearly on the tribe\u2019s side, courts have a very bad habit of bending and breaking the rules to satisfy the state or non-Native residents. One of the things that\u2019s really shocked me is how often our government institutions ignore the law when it comes to tribes and how hard tribes have to fight for just the law to be followed.

Smith, High Country NewsMarch 25, 2025<h1>Rebecca Nagle considers Supreme Court wins and what\u2019s at stake for tribes under Trump</h1> <p class=\"byline\">by Anna V. Smith, High Country News <br />March 25, 2025</p> <p class=\"has-drop-cap\">During the forced<strong> </strong>removal of Muscogee (Creek) people from their ancestral lands in the Southeastern U.S., tribal members carried the embers and ashes of their town fires with them, determined to re-establish the flames in the new communities they planned to build in what\u2019s now known as Oklahoma. Those fires still burn today in places on the Muscogee Reservation.</p> <div class=\"wp-block-group alignright\"> <!-- RTT removed image (333291) --> <p class=\"has-text-align-left\"><em><em>By the Fire We Carry</em> </em><br />By Rebecca Nagle<br />352 pages, hardcover: $30<br />Harper, 2024.</p> </p></div> <p>In <em>By the Fire We Carry</em>, Cherokee journalist Rebecca Nagle documents the interwoven stories of tribal land dispossession, forced removal, a murder in a small tribal community, her own family history and three recent and consequential Supreme Court decisions about tribal jurisdiction over lands in Oklahoma. Two of them, <em>Murphy v. Oklahoma</em> and <em>McGirt v. Oklahoma, </em>centered on crimes on land that the state of Oklahoma argued was no longer part of the Muscogee and Cherokee Nations\u2019 respective reservations. In both cases, the Supreme Court upheld the tribes\u2019 arguments in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. But shortly after came <em>Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta</em>, in which the Supreme Court sidestepped a century of federal Indian law and gave states jurisdiction to prosecute crimes on tribal lands when the perpetrator was non-Native and the victim was Native. The connections Nagle makes span generations and offer insight into our current political turmoil, at a time when a second Trump administration is testing the limits of executive authority and the law.</p> <p>In a conversation with <em>High Country News</em>, Nagle discusses how the U.S. still wields its power of empire, what impact the Trump administration could have on tribal sovereignty, and the enduring weight of history.</p> <p><em>This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p> <p><strong><em>High Country News</em></strong>: <strong>In this book, you don\u2019t just focus on the 20-year histories of these three Supreme Court cases but also tell the stories of the Muscogee and Cherokee nations before the U.S. existed.

Smith, High Country NewsMarch 25, 2025<h1>Rebecca Nagle considers Supreme Court wins and what\u2019s at stake for tribes under Trump</h1> <p class=\"byline\">by Anna V. Smith, High Country News <br />March 25, 2025</p> <p class=\"has-drop-cap\">During the forced<strong> </strong>removal of Muscogee (Creek) people from their ancestral lands in the Southeastern U.S., tribal members carried the embers and ashes of their town fires with them, determined to re-establish the flames in the new communities they planned to build in what\u2019s now known as Oklahoma. Those fires still burn today in places on the Muscogee Reservation.</p> <div class=\"wp-block-group alignright\"> <!-- RTT removed image (333291) --> <p class=\"has-text-align-left\"><em><em>By the Fire We Carry</em> </em><br />By Rebecca Nagle<br />352 pages, hardcover: $30<br />Harper, 2024.</p> </p></div> <p>In <em>By the Fire We Carry</em>, Cherokee journalist Rebecca Nagle documents the interwoven stories of tribal land dispossession, forced removal, a murder in a small tribal community, her own family history and three recent and consequential Supreme Court decisions about tribal jurisdiction over lands in Oklahoma. Two of them, <em>Murphy v. Oklahoma</em> and <em>McGirt v. Oklahoma, </em>centered on crimes on land that the state of Oklahoma argued was no longer part of the Muscogee and Cherokee Nations\u2019 respective reservations. In both cases, the Supreme Court upheld the tribes\u2019 arguments in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. But shortly after came <em>Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta</em>, in which the Supreme Court sidestepped a century of federal Indian law and gave states jurisdiction to prosecute crimes on tribal lands when the perpetrator was non-Native and the victim was Native. The connections Nagle makes span generations and offer insight into our current political turmoil, at a time when a second Trump administration is testing the limits of executive authority and the law.</p> <p>In a conversation with <em>High Country News</em>, Nagle discusses how the U.S. still wields its power of empire, what impact the Trump administration could have on tribal sovereignty, and the enduring weight of history.</p> <p><em>This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p> <p><strong><em>High Country News</em></strong>: <strong>In this book, you don\u2019t just focus on the 20-year histories of these three Supreme Court cases but also tell the stories of the Muscogee and Cherokee nations before the U.S. existed. Why did you decide to take such a long view?</strong></p> <p><strong>Rebecca Nagle:</strong> One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present. I also wanted people to get a sense of how history repeats itself, and how things like a lie that tribal land is lawless get used over and over again, or the excuse that, \u201cOh, <em>this</em> is actually what\u2019s best for Native people.\u201d I wanted people to be able to see and identify those patterns.&nbsp;</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present.</p> </blockquote> <p>When I found out about the <em>McGirt</em> decision and saw the implications that my tribe\u2019s reservation would be recognized again, it was a really overwhelming emotion of relief, of joy, but there was also a lot of sadness, because I knew how much my ancestors, and Cherokee ancestors in general, had sacrificed to reach this moment. I think that a lot of other tribal citizens felt that the day that we were celebrating the Supreme Court decision. I think we all felt that weight of history. And I wanted the reader to feel that weight of history \u2014 to understand this isn\u2019t a simple story of, \u201cYay, the tribes won!\u201d There\u2019s a lot that\u2019s implicated in that victory and a lot that was lost for that rare legal victory to happen.</p> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the book you hold multiple difficult truths at once, like how George Jacobs\u2019 death \u2014 which caused so much pain for his community \u2014 was the origin of the Murphy case and also resulted in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. Similarly, the truth of your ancestor, John Ridge, who signed a treaty that resulted in forced removal of the Cherokee people. It was against their wishes, and also what he thought he had to do to save his nation. How did you navigate that? It can be so easy to collapse these tensions to make for a simpler narrative.&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> Absolutely. As a journalist, my North Star is the truth. And I think the truth is complicated. I don\u2019t think we can tell the whole story of the <em>McGirt</em> victory without talking about the crimes and the tragedy that it originated in. And I think the same is true for my ancestors. I was sort of raised to think one thing, but I went back through the historical records and really tried to look at it for what it was. There\u2019s a lot that we can learn from the desperation of my ancestors and their decision to sign that treaty. We can learn just how violent U.S. policy was at that time, that they would make a decision like that. There\u2019s a cultural impulse to tell stories where there are clear heroes and clear villains, and victories like <em>McGirt</em> come from a good place, and things are clean-cut. I think that history is actually quite messy. I wanted a book that reflected that reality.</p> <!-- RTT removed image (333265) --> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the aftermath of the McGirt decision, the state of Oklahoma pushed a narrative of chaos and disruption in the criminal justice system, which some national outlets then repeated without much discernment.

And I think the treatment of Indigenous nations is a glaring example of that, because we\u2019ve never had any kind of constitutional amendment or reform to change those laws and to change those policies. To dispossess Indigenous people of their land, the U.S. government gave itself a lot of power over people who are not U.S. citizens. That power of empire is embedded in our Constitution, because our country wanted to take Indigenous land. We still see it manifested in deportation and shutting down asylum and separating families at the border and banning Muslims from entering our country. If we really don\u2019t want these types of policies to be enacted, there are some bigger questions about our democracy that as a society we haven\u2019t even begun to ask.</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p> If we really don\u2019t want these types of policies to be enacted, there are some bigger questions about our democracy that as a society we haven\u2019t even begun to ask.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>Given that, do you have any specific concerns about potential attacks on tribal sovereignty under a second Trump administration?</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> Everything has the capacity to get worse. A lot of tribal programs, whether it\u2019s (the Indian Health Service) or tribal courts, tribal law enforcement, rely on federal dollars. There\u2019s a lot specifically at stake for tribes under Trump. The remaking of the federal judiciary has a profound impact on tribes, because our cases are federal; they don\u2019t go through state court. And, unfortunately, the courts \u2014 dating back to before Trump \u2014 have not been reliable sources for justice for tribes. Even when the law is clearly on the tribe\u2019s side, courts have a very bad habit of bending and breaking the rules to satisfy the state or non-Native residents. One of the things that\u2019s really shocked me is how often our government institutions ignore the law when it comes to tribes and how hard tribes have to fight for just the law to be followed. Those weaknesses in our democracy have been there for a long time.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p> <p><em>We welcome reader letters.

I think that a lot of other tribal citizens felt that the day that we were celebrating the Supreme Court decision. I think we all felt that weight of history.

I was sort of raised to think one thing, but I went back through the historical records and really tried to look at it for what it was. There\u2019s a lot that we can learn from the desperation of my ancestors and their decision to sign that treaty.

Smith, High Country NewsMarch 25, 2025<h1>Rebecca Nagle considers Supreme Court wins and what\u2019s at stake for tribes under Trump</h1> <p class=\"byline\">by Anna V. Smith, High Country News <br />March 25, 2025</p> <p class=\"has-drop-cap\">During the forced<strong> </strong>removal of Muscogee (Creek) people from their ancestral lands in the Southeastern U.S., tribal members carried the embers and ashes of their town fires with them, determined to re-establish the flames in the new communities they planned to build in what\u2019s now known as Oklahoma. Those fires still burn today in places on the Muscogee Reservation.</p> <div class=\"wp-block-group alignright\"> <!-- RTT removed image (333291) --> <p class=\"has-text-align-left\"><em><em>By the Fire We Carry</em> </em><br />By Rebecca Nagle<br />352 pages, hardcover: $30<br />Harper, 2024.</p> </p></div> <p>In <em>By the Fire We Carry</em>, Cherokee journalist Rebecca Nagle documents the interwoven stories of tribal land dispossession, forced removal, a murder in a small tribal community, her own family history and three recent and consequential Supreme Court decisions about tribal jurisdiction over lands in Oklahoma. Two of them, <em>Murphy v. Oklahoma</em> and <em>McGirt v. Oklahoma, </em>centered on crimes on land that the state of Oklahoma argued was no longer part of the Muscogee and Cherokee Nations\u2019 respective reservations. In both cases, the Supreme Court upheld the tribes\u2019 arguments in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. But shortly after came <em>Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta</em>, in which the Supreme Court sidestepped a century of federal Indian law and gave states jurisdiction to prosecute crimes on tribal lands when the perpetrator was non-Native and the victim was Native. The connections Nagle makes span generations and offer insight into our current political turmoil, at a time when a second Trump administration is testing the limits of executive authority and the law.</p> <p>In a conversation with <em>High Country News</em>, Nagle discusses how the U.S. still wields its power of empire, what impact the Trump administration could have on tribal sovereignty, and the enduring weight of history.</p> <p><em>This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p> <p><strong><em>High Country News</em></strong>: <strong>In this book, you don\u2019t just focus on the 20-year histories of these three Supreme Court cases but also tell the stories of the Muscogee and Cherokee nations before the U.S. existed. Why did you decide to take such a long view?</strong></p> <p><strong>Rebecca Nagle:</strong> One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present. I also wanted people to get a sense of how history repeats itself, and how things like a lie that tribal land is lawless get used over and over again, or the excuse that, \u201cOh, <em>this</em> is actually what\u2019s best for Native people.\u201d I wanted people to be able to see and identify those patterns.&nbsp;</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present.</p> </blockquote> <p>When I found out about the <em>McGirt</em> decision and saw the implications that my tribe\u2019s reservation would be recognized again, it was a really overwhelming emotion of relief, of joy, but there was also a lot of sadness, because I knew how much my ancestors, and Cherokee ancestors in general, had sacrificed to reach this moment.

A lot of tribal programs, whether it\u2019s (the Indian Health Service) or tribal courts, tribal law enforcement, rely on federal dollars. There\u2019s a lot specifically at stake for tribes under Trump. The remaking of the federal judiciary has a profound impact on tribes, because our cases are federal; they don\u2019t go through state court. And, unfortunately, the courts \u2014 dating back to before Trump \u2014 have not been reliable sources for justice for tribes. Even when the law is clearly on the tribe\u2019s side, courts have a very bad habit of bending and breaking the rules to satisfy the state or non-Native residents. One of the things that\u2019s really shocked me is how often our government institutions ignore the law when it comes to tribes and how hard tribes have to fight for just the law to be followed.

Smith, High Country NewsMarch 25, 2025<h1>Rebecca Nagle considers Supreme Court wins and what\u2019s at stake for tribes under Trump</h1> <p class=\"byline\">by Anna V. Smith, High Country News <br />March 25, 2025</p> <p class=\"has-drop-cap\">During the forced<strong> </strong>removal of Muscogee (Creek) people from their ancestral lands in the Southeastern U.S., tribal members carried the embers and ashes of their town fires with them, determined to re-establish the flames in the new communities they planned to build in what\u2019s now known as Oklahoma. Those fires still burn today in places on the Muscogee Reservation.</p> <div class=\"wp-block-group alignright\"> <!-- RTT removed image (333291) --> <p class=\"has-text-align-left\"><em><em>By the Fire We Carry</em> </em><br />By Rebecca Nagle<br />352 pages, hardcover: $30<br />Harper, 2024.</p> </p></div> <p>In <em>By the Fire We Carry</em>, Cherokee journalist Rebecca Nagle documents the interwoven stories of tribal land dispossession, forced removal, a murder in a small tribal community, her own family history and three recent and consequential Supreme Court decisions about tribal jurisdiction over lands in Oklahoma. Two of them, <em>Murphy v. Oklahoma</em> and <em>McGirt v. Oklahoma, </em>centered on crimes on land that the state of Oklahoma argued was no longer part of the Muscogee and Cherokee Nations\u2019 respective reservations. In both cases, the Supreme Court upheld the tribes\u2019 arguments in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. But shortly after came <em>Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta</em>, in which the Supreme Court sidestepped a century of federal Indian law and gave states jurisdiction to prosecute crimes on tribal lands when the perpetrator was non-Native and the victim was Native. The connections Nagle makes span generations and offer insight into our current political turmoil, at a time when a second Trump administration is testing the limits of executive authority and the law.</p> <p>In a conversation with <em>High Country News</em>, Nagle discusses how the U.S. still wields its power of empire, what impact the Trump administration could have on tribal sovereignty, and the enduring weight of history.</p> <p><em>This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p> <p><strong><em>High Country News</em></strong>: <strong>In this book, you don\u2019t just focus on the 20-year histories of these three Supreme Court cases but also tell the stories of the Muscogee and Cherokee nations before the U.S. existed. Why did you decide to take such a long view?</strong></p> <p><strong>Rebecca Nagle:</strong> One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present. I also wanted people to get a sense of how history repeats itself, and how things like a lie that tribal land is lawless get used over and over again, or the excuse that, \u201cOh, <em>this</em> is actually what\u2019s best for Native people.\u201d I wanted people to be able to see and identify those patterns.&nbsp;</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present.</p> </blockquote> <p>When I found out about the <em>McGirt</em> decision and saw the implications that my tribe\u2019s reservation would be recognized again, it was a really overwhelming emotion of relief, of joy, but there was also a lot of sadness, because I knew how much my ancestors, and Cherokee ancestors in general, had sacrificed to reach this moment. I think that a lot of other tribal citizens felt that the day that we were celebrating the Supreme Court decision. I think we all felt that weight of history. And I wanted the reader to feel that weight of history \u2014 to understand this isn\u2019t a simple story of, \u201cYay, the tribes won!\u201d There\u2019s a lot that\u2019s implicated in that victory and a lot that was lost for that rare legal victory to happen.</p> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the book you hold multiple difficult truths at once, like how George Jacobs\u2019 death \u2014 which caused so much pain for his community \u2014 was the origin of the Murphy case and also resulted in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. Similarly, the truth of your ancestor, John Ridge, who signed a treaty that resulted in forced removal of the Cherokee people. It was against their wishes, and also what he thought he had to do to save his nation. How did you navigate that?

There\u2019s a lot that we can learn from the desperation of my ancestors and their decision to sign that treaty. We can learn just how violent U.S. policy was at that time, that they would make a decision like that. There\u2019s a cultural impulse to tell stories where there are clear heroes and clear villains, and victories like <em>McGirt</em> come from a good place, and things are clean-cut.

Smith, High Country NewsMarch 25, 2025<h1>Rebecca Nagle considers Supreme Court wins and what\u2019s at stake for tribes under Trump</h1> <p class=\"byline\">by Anna V. Smith, High Country News <br />March 25, 2025</p> <p class=\"has-drop-cap\">During the forced<strong> </strong>removal of Muscogee (Creek) people from their ancestral lands in the Southeastern U.S., tribal members carried the embers and ashes of their town fires with them, determined to re-establish the flames in the new communities they planned to build in what\u2019s now known as Oklahoma. Those fires still burn today in places on the Muscogee Reservation.</p> <div class=\"wp-block-group alignright\"> <!-- RTT removed image (333291) --> <p class=\"has-text-align-left\"><em><em>By the Fire We Carry</em> </em><br />By Rebecca Nagle<br />352 pages, hardcover: $30<br />Harper, 2024.</p> </p></div> <p>In <em>By the Fire We Carry</em>, Cherokee journalist Rebecca Nagle documents the interwoven stories of tribal land dispossession, forced removal, a murder in a small tribal community, her own family history and three recent and consequential Supreme Court decisions about tribal jurisdiction over lands in Oklahoma. Two of them, <em>Murphy v. Oklahoma</em> and <em>McGirt v. Oklahoma, </em>centered on crimes on land that the state of Oklahoma argued was no longer part of the Muscogee and Cherokee Nations\u2019 respective reservations. In both cases, the Supreme Court upheld the tribes\u2019 arguments in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. But shortly after came <em>Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta</em>, in which the Supreme Court sidestepped a century of federal Indian law and gave states jurisdiction to prosecute crimes on tribal lands when the perpetrator was non-Native and the victim was Native. The connections Nagle makes span generations and offer insight into our current political turmoil, at a time when a second Trump administration is testing the limits of executive authority and the law.</p> <p>In a conversation with <em>High Country News</em>, Nagle discusses how the U.S. still wields its power of empire, what impact the Trump administration could have on tribal sovereignty, and the enduring weight of history.</p> <p><em>This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p> <p><strong><em>High Country News</em></strong>: <strong>In this book, you don\u2019t just focus on the 20-year histories of these three Supreme Court cases but also tell the stories of the Muscogee and Cherokee nations before the U.S. existed. Why did you decide to take such a long view?</strong></p> <p><strong>Rebecca Nagle:</strong> One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present. I also wanted people to get a sense of how history repeats itself, and how things like a lie that tribal land is lawless get used over and over again, or the excuse that, \u201cOh, <em>this</em> is actually what\u2019s best for Native people.\u201d I wanted people to be able to see and identify those patterns.&nbsp;</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present.</p> </blockquote> <p>When I found out about the <em>McGirt</em> decision and saw the implications that my tribe\u2019s reservation would be recognized again, it was a really overwhelming emotion of relief, of joy, but there was also a lot of sadness, because I knew how much my ancestors, and Cherokee ancestors in general, had sacrificed to reach this moment. I think that a lot of other tribal citizens felt that the day that we were celebrating the Supreme Court decision. I think we all felt that weight of history. And I wanted the reader to feel that weight of history \u2014 to understand this isn\u2019t a simple story of, \u201cYay, the tribes won!\u201d There\u2019s a lot that\u2019s implicated in that victory and a lot that was lost for that rare legal victory to happen.</p> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the book you hold multiple difficult truths at once, like how George Jacobs\u2019 death \u2014 which caused so much pain for his community \u2014 was the origin of the Murphy case and also resulted in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. Similarly, the truth of your ancestor, John Ridge, who signed a treaty that resulted in forced removal of the Cherokee people. It was against their wishes, and also what he thought he had to do to save his nation. How did you navigate that? It can be so easy to collapse these tensions to make for a simpler narrative.&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> Absolutely. As a journalist, my North Star is the truth. And I think the truth is complicated. I don\u2019t think we can tell the whole story of the <em>McGirt</em> victory without talking about the crimes and the tragedy that it originated in. And I think the same is true for my ancestors. I was sort of raised to think one thing, but I went back through the historical records and really tried to look at it for what it was. There\u2019s a lot that we can learn from the desperation of my ancestors and their decision to sign that treaty. We can learn just how violent U.S. policy was at that time, that they would make a decision like that. There\u2019s a cultural impulse to tell stories where there are clear heroes and clear villains, and victories like <em>McGirt</em> come from a good place, and things are clean-cut. I think that history is actually quite messy. I wanted a book that reflected that reality.</p> <!-- RTT removed image (333265) --> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the aftermath of the McGirt decision, the state of Oklahoma pushed a narrative of chaos and disruption in the criminal justice system, which some national outlets then repeated without much discernment.

Smith, High Country NewsMarch 25, 2025<h1>Rebecca Nagle considers Supreme Court wins and what\u2019s at stake for tribes under Trump</h1> <p class=\"byline\">by Anna V. Smith, High Country News <br />March 25, 2025</p> <p class=\"has-drop-cap\">During the forced<strong> </strong>removal of Muscogee (Creek) people from their ancestral lands in the Southeastern U.S., tribal members carried the embers and ashes of their town fires with them, determined to re-establish the flames in the new communities they planned to build in what\u2019s now known as Oklahoma. Those fires still burn today in places on the Muscogee Reservation.</p> <div class=\"wp-block-group alignright\"> <!-- RTT removed image (333291) --> <p class=\"has-text-align-left\"><em><em>By the Fire We Carry</em> </em><br />By Rebecca Nagle<br />352 pages, hardcover: $30<br />Harper, 2024.</p> </p></div> <p>In <em>By the Fire We Carry</em>, Cherokee journalist Rebecca Nagle documents the interwoven stories of tribal land dispossession, forced removal, a murder in a small tribal community, her own family history and three recent and consequential Supreme Court decisions about tribal jurisdiction over lands in Oklahoma. Two of them, <em>Murphy v. Oklahoma</em> and <em>McGirt v. Oklahoma, </em>centered on crimes on land that the state of Oklahoma argued was no longer part of the Muscogee and Cherokee Nations\u2019 respective reservations. In both cases, the Supreme Court upheld the tribes\u2019 arguments in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. But shortly after came <em>Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta</em>, in which the Supreme Court sidestepped a century of federal Indian law and gave states jurisdiction to prosecute crimes on tribal lands when the perpetrator was non-Native and the victim was Native. The connections Nagle makes span generations and offer insight into our current political turmoil, at a time when a second Trump administration is testing the limits of executive authority and the law.</p> <p>In a conversation with <em>High Country News</em>, Nagle discusses how the U.S. still wields its power of empire, what impact the Trump administration could have on tribal sovereignty, and the enduring weight of history.</p> <p><em>This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p> <p><strong><em>High Country News</em></strong>: <strong>In this book, you don\u2019t just focus on the 20-year histories of these three Supreme Court cases but also tell the stories of the Muscogee and Cherokee nations before the U.S. existed. Why did you decide to take such a long view?</strong></p> <p><strong>Rebecca Nagle:</strong> One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present. I also wanted people to get a sense of how history repeats itself, and how things like a lie that tribal land is lawless get used over and over again, or the excuse that, \u201cOh, <em>this</em> is actually what\u2019s best for Native people.\u201d I wanted people to be able to see and identify those patterns.&nbsp;</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present.</p> </blockquote> <p>When I found out about the <em>McGirt</em> decision and saw the implications that my tribe\u2019s reservation would be recognized again, it was a really overwhelming emotion of relief, of joy, but there was also a lot of sadness, because I knew how much my ancestors, and Cherokee ancestors in general, had sacrificed to reach this moment. I think that a lot of other tribal citizens felt that the day that we were celebrating the Supreme Court decision. I think we all felt that weight of history. And I wanted the reader to feel that weight of history \u2014 to understand this isn\u2019t a simple story of, \u201cYay, the tribes won!\u201d There\u2019s a lot that\u2019s implicated in that victory and a lot that was lost for that rare legal victory to happen.</p> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the book you hold multiple difficult truths at once, like how George Jacobs\u2019 death \u2014 which caused so much pain for his community \u2014 was the origin of the Murphy case and also resulted in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. Similarly, the truth of your ancestor, John Ridge, who signed a treaty that resulted in forced removal of the Cherokee people. It was against their wishes, and also what he thought he had to do to save his nation. How did you navigate that? It can be so easy to collapse these tensions to make for a simpler narrative.&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> Absolutely. As a journalist, my North Star is the truth. And I think the truth is complicated. I don\u2019t think we can tell the whole story of the <em>McGirt</em> victory without talking about the crimes and the tragedy that it originated in. And I think the same is true for my ancestors. I was sort of raised to think one thing, but I went back through the historical records and really tried to look at it for what it was. There\u2019s a lot that we can learn from the desperation of my ancestors and their decision to sign that treaty. We can learn just how violent U.S. policy was at that time, that they would make a decision like that. There\u2019s a cultural impulse to tell stories where there are clear heroes and clear villains, and victories like <em>McGirt</em> come from a good place, and things are clean-cut. I think that history is actually quite messy. I wanted a book that reflected that reality.</p> <!-- RTT removed image (333265) --> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the aftermath of the McGirt decision, the state of Oklahoma pushed a narrative of chaos and disruption in the criminal justice system, which some national outlets then repeated without much discernment. Can you talk about the role of the media \u2014 including the lack of Indigenous representation in newsrooms \u2014 and how that shapes the public\u2019s understanding of things like tribal sovereignty?</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> I think that it\u2019s a really big hindrance to our rights as Indigenous nations and to our sovereignty. Less than a fraction of a percent of the people staffing newsrooms are Native. Coverage of Indigenous issues very often fails to meet the standards of journalism. It doesn\u2019t have context, or a depth of knowledge of what\u2019s going on. They send reporters who\u2019ve never been on a reservation to do reporting about criminal justice on tribal land. It creates an environment where you can tell lies about tribes, and people will think that it\u2019s true.</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> </blockquote> <p>And unfortunately, that\u2019s what happened. In the wake of <em>McGirt</em>, (Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, R) made some very bold and outlandish claims about the number of criminal cases that could be prosecuted moving forward. I did some digging around with a fellow reporter, Allison Herrera, and Oklahoma\u2019s claims fell apart completely. But they were still repeated and cited by prominent outlets like the <em>Washington Post</em> and <em>The Wall Street Journal.</em> Oklahoma then cited those articles in their briefs, and some of that inaccurate information was actually in the (<em>Castro-Huerta</em>) Supreme Court decision. And so it was this tornado of disinformation that made it all the way up to the Supreme Court. Normally, we think that the <em>Washington Post</em> is a check on bad information, but not when it comes to tribes, which should be an embarrassment for them.</p> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>We\u2019re in a moment of major law and policy change under a new administration. What are some lessons from your reporting that apply to our current moment?</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> We talk about it as a problem that originates with Trump, instead of a problem that originates with some of the flaws in our democracy. And I think the treatment of Indigenous nations is a glaring example of that, because we\u2019ve never had any kind of constitutional amendment or reform to change those laws and to change those policies. To dispossess Indigenous people of their land, the U.S. government gave itself a lot of power over people who are not U.S. citizens. That power of empire is embedded in our Constitution, because our country wanted to take Indigenous land. We still see it manifested in deportation and shutting down asylum and separating families at the border and banning Muslims from entering our country. If we really don\u2019t want these types of policies to be enacted, there are some bigger questions about our democracy that as a society we haven\u2019t even begun to ask.</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p> If we really don\u2019t want these types of policies to be enacted, there are some bigger questions about our democracy that as a society we haven\u2019t even begun to ask.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>Given that, do you have any specific concerns about potential attacks on tribal sovereignty under a second Trump administration?</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> Everything has the capacity to get worse.

Even when the law is clearly on the tribe\u2019s side, courts have a very bad habit of bending and breaking the rules to satisfy the state or non-Native residents. One of the things that\u2019s really shocked me is how often our government institutions ignore the law when it comes to tribes and how hard tribes have to fight for just the law to be followed.

There\u2019s a lot specifically at stake for tribes under Trump. The remaking of the federal judiciary has a profound impact on tribes, because our cases are federal; they don\u2019t go through state court.

Smith, High Country NewsMarch 25, 2025<h1>Rebecca Nagle considers Supreme Court wins and what\u2019s at stake for tribes under Trump</h1> <p class=\"byline\">by Anna V. Smith, High Country News <br />March 25, 2025</p> <p class=\"has-drop-cap\">During the forced<strong> </strong>removal of Muscogee (Creek) people from their ancestral lands in the Southeastern U.S., tribal members carried the embers and ashes of their town fires with them, determined to re-establish the flames in the new communities they planned to build in what\u2019s now known as Oklahoma. Those fires still burn today in places on the Muscogee Reservation.</p> <div class=\"wp-block-group alignright\"> <!-- RTT removed image (333291) --> <p class=\"has-text-align-left\"><em><em>By the Fire We Carry</em> </em><br />By Rebecca Nagle<br />352 pages, hardcover: $30<br />Harper, 2024.</p> </p></div> <p>In <em>By the Fire We Carry</em>, Cherokee journalist Rebecca Nagle documents the interwoven stories of tribal land dispossession, forced removal, a murder in a small tribal community, her own family history and three recent and consequential Supreme Court decisions about tribal jurisdiction over lands in Oklahoma. Two of them, <em>Murphy v. Oklahoma</em> and <em>McGirt v. Oklahoma, </em>centered on crimes on land that the state of Oklahoma argued was no longer part of the Muscogee and Cherokee Nations\u2019 respective reservations. In both cases, the Supreme Court upheld the tribes\u2019 arguments in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. But shortly after came <em>Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta</em>, in which the Supreme Court sidestepped a century of federal Indian law and gave states jurisdiction to prosecute crimes on tribal lands when the perpetrator was non-Native and the victim was Native. The connections Nagle makes span generations and offer insight into our current political turmoil, at a time when a second Trump administration is testing the limits of executive authority and the law.</p> <p>In a conversation with <em>High Country News</em>, Nagle discusses how the U.S. still wields its power of empire, what impact the Trump administration could have on tribal sovereignty, and the enduring weight of history.</p> <p><em>This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p> <p><strong><em>High Country News</em></strong>: <strong>In this book, you don\u2019t just focus on the 20-year histories of these three Supreme Court cases but also tell the stories of the Muscogee and Cherokee nations before the U.S. existed. Why did you decide to take such a long view?</strong></p> <p><strong>Rebecca Nagle:</strong> One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present. I also wanted people to get a sense of how history repeats itself, and how things like a lie that tribal land is lawless get used over and over again, or the excuse that, \u201cOh, <em>this</em> is actually what\u2019s best for Native people.\u201d I wanted people to be able to see and identify those patterns.&nbsp;</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present.</p> </blockquote> <p>When I found out about the <em>McGirt</em> decision and saw the implications that my tribe\u2019s reservation would be recognized again, it was a really overwhelming emotion of relief, of joy, but there was also a lot of sadness, because I knew how much my ancestors, and Cherokee ancestors in general, had sacrificed to reach this moment. I think that a lot of other tribal citizens felt that the day that we were celebrating the Supreme Court decision. I think we all felt that weight of history. And I wanted the reader to feel that weight of history \u2014 to understand this isn\u2019t a simple story of, \u201cYay, the tribes won!\u201d There\u2019s a lot that\u2019s implicated in that victory and a lot that was lost for that rare legal victory to happen.</p> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the book you hold multiple difficult truths at once, like how George Jacobs\u2019 death \u2014 which caused so much pain for his community \u2014 was the origin of the Murphy case and also resulted in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. Similarly, the truth of your ancestor, John Ridge, who signed a treaty that resulted in forced removal of the Cherokee people. It was against their wishes, and also what he thought he had to do to save his nation. How did you navigate that? It can be so easy to collapse these tensions to make for a simpler narrative.&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> Absolutely. As a journalist, my North Star is the truth. And I think the truth is complicated. I don\u2019t think we can tell the whole story of the <em>McGirt</em> victory without talking about the crimes and the tragedy that it originated in. And I think the same is true for my ancestors. I was sort of raised to think one thing, but I went back through the historical records and really tried to look at it for what it was. There\u2019s a lot that we can learn from the desperation of my ancestors and their decision to sign that treaty. We can learn just how violent U.S. policy was at that time, that they would make a decision like that. There\u2019s a cultural impulse to tell stories where there are clear heroes and clear villains, and victories like <em>McGirt</em> come from a good place, and things are clean-cut. I think that history is actually quite messy. I wanted a book that reflected that reality.</p> <!-- RTT removed image (333265) --> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the aftermath of the McGirt decision, the state of Oklahoma pushed a narrative of chaos and disruption in the criminal justice system, which some national outlets then repeated without much discernment. Can you talk about the role of the media \u2014 including the lack of Indigenous representation in newsrooms \u2014 and how that shapes the public\u2019s understanding of things like tribal sovereignty?</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> I think that it\u2019s a really big hindrance to our rights as Indigenous nations and to our sovereignty. Less than a fraction of a percent of the people staffing newsrooms are Native. Coverage of Indigenous issues very often fails to meet the standards of journalism. It doesn\u2019t have context, or a depth of knowledge of what\u2019s going on. They send reporters who\u2019ve never been on a reservation to do reporting about criminal justice on tribal land. It creates an environment where you can tell lies about tribes, and people will think that it\u2019s true.</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> </blockquote> <p>And unfortunately, that\u2019s what happened. In the wake of <em>McGirt</em>, (Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, R) made some very bold and outlandish claims about the number of criminal cases that could be prosecuted moving forward. I did some digging around with a fellow reporter, Allison Herrera, and Oklahoma\u2019s claims fell apart completely. But they were still repeated and cited by prominent outlets like the <em>Washington Post</em> and <em>The Wall Street Journal.</em> Oklahoma then cited those articles in their briefs, and some of that inaccurate information was actually in the (<em>Castro-Huerta</em>) Supreme Court decision. And so it was this tornado of disinformation that made it all the way up to the Supreme Court. Normally, we think that the <em>Washington Post</em> is a check on bad information, but not when it comes to tribes, which should be an embarrassment for them.</p> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>We\u2019re in a moment of major law and policy change under a new administration.

Smith, High Country NewsMarch 25, 2025<h1>Rebecca Nagle considers Supreme Court wins and what\u2019s at stake for tribes under Trump</h1> <p class=\"byline\">by Anna V. Smith, High Country News <br />March 25, 2025</p> <p class=\"has-drop-cap\">During the forced<strong> </strong>removal of Muscogee (Creek) people from their ancestral lands in the Southeastern U.S., tribal members carried the embers and ashes of their town fires with them, determined to re-establish the flames in the new communities they planned to build in what\u2019s now known as Oklahoma. Those fires still burn today in places on the Muscogee Reservation.</p> <div class=\"wp-block-group alignright\"> <!-- RTT removed image (333291) --> <p class=\"has-text-align-left\"><em><em>By the Fire We Carry</em> </em><br />By Rebecca Nagle<br />352 pages, hardcover: $30<br />Harper, 2024.</p> </p></div> <p>In <em>By the Fire We Carry</em>, Cherokee journalist Rebecca Nagle documents the interwoven stories of tribal land dispossession, forced removal, a murder in a small tribal community, her own family history and three recent and consequential Supreme Court decisions about tribal jurisdiction over lands in Oklahoma. Two of them, <em>Murphy v. Oklahoma</em> and <em>McGirt v. Oklahoma, </em>centered on crimes on land that the state of Oklahoma argued was no longer part of the Muscogee and Cherokee Nations\u2019 respective reservations. In both cases, the Supreme Court upheld the tribes\u2019 arguments in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. But shortly after came <em>Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta</em>, in which the Supreme Court sidestepped a century of federal Indian law and gave states jurisdiction to prosecute crimes on tribal lands when the perpetrator was non-Native and the victim was Native. The connections Nagle makes span generations and offer insight into our current political turmoil, at a time when a second Trump administration is testing the limits of executive authority and the law.</p> <p>In a conversation with <em>High Country News</em>, Nagle discusses how the U.S. still wields its power of empire, what impact the Trump administration could have on tribal sovereignty, and the enduring weight of history.</p> <p><em>This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p> <p><strong><em>High Country News</em></strong>: <strong>In this book, you don\u2019t just focus on the 20-year histories of these three Supreme Court cases but also tell the stories of the Muscogee and Cherokee nations before the U.S. existed. Why did you decide to take such a long view?</strong></p> <p><strong>Rebecca Nagle:</strong> One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present. I also wanted people to get a sense of how history repeats itself, and how things like a lie that tribal land is lawless get used over and over again, or the excuse that, \u201cOh, <em>this</em> is actually what\u2019s best for Native people.\u201d I wanted people to be able to see and identify those patterns.&nbsp;</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present.</p> </blockquote> <p>When I found out about the <em>McGirt</em> decision and saw the implications that my tribe\u2019s reservation would be recognized again, it was a really overwhelming emotion of relief, of joy, but there was also a lot of sadness, because I knew how much my ancestors, and Cherokee ancestors in general, had sacrificed to reach this moment. I think that a lot of other tribal citizens felt that the day that we were celebrating the Supreme Court decision. I think we all felt that weight of history. And I wanted the reader to feel that weight of history \u2014 to understand this isn\u2019t a simple story of, \u201cYay, the tribes won!\u201d There\u2019s a lot that\u2019s implicated in that victory and a lot that was lost for that rare legal victory to happen.</p> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the book you hold multiple difficult truths at once, like how George Jacobs\u2019 death \u2014 which caused so much pain for his community \u2014 was the origin of the Murphy case and also resulted in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. Similarly, the truth of your ancestor, John Ridge, who signed a treaty that resulted in forced removal of the Cherokee people. It was against their wishes, and also what he thought he had to do to save his nation. How did you navigate that? It can be so easy to collapse these tensions to make for a simpler narrative.&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> Absolutely. As a journalist, my North Star is the truth. And I think the truth is complicated. I don\u2019t think we can tell the whole story of the <em>McGirt</em> victory without talking about the crimes and the tragedy that it originated in. And I think the same is true for my ancestors. I was sort of raised to think one thing, but I went back through the historical records and really tried to look at it for what it was. There\u2019s a lot that we can learn from the desperation of my ancestors and their decision to sign that treaty. We can learn just how violent U.S. policy was at that time, that they would make a decision like that. There\u2019s a cultural impulse to tell stories where there are clear heroes and clear villains, and victories like <em>McGirt</em> come from a good place, and things are clean-cut. I think that history is actually quite messy.

Smith, High Country NewsMarch 25, 2025<h1>Rebecca Nagle considers Supreme Court wins and what\u2019s at stake for tribes under Trump</h1> <p class=\"byline\">by Anna V. Smith, High Country News <br />March 25, 2025</p> <p class=\"has-drop-cap\">During the forced<strong> </strong>removal of Muscogee (Creek) people from their ancestral lands in the Southeastern U.S., tribal members carried the embers and ashes of their town fires with them, determined to re-establish the flames in the new communities they planned to build in what\u2019s now known as Oklahoma. Those fires still burn today in places on the Muscogee Reservation.</p> <div class=\"wp-block-group alignright\"> <!-- RTT removed image (333291) --> <p class=\"has-text-align-left\"><em><em>By the Fire We Carry</em> </em><br />By Rebecca Nagle<br />352 pages, hardcover: $30<br />Harper, 2024.</p> </p></div> <p>In <em>By the Fire We Carry</em>, Cherokee journalist Rebecca Nagle documents the interwoven stories of tribal land dispossession, forced removal, a murder in a small tribal community, her own family history and three recent and consequential Supreme Court decisions about tribal jurisdiction over lands in Oklahoma. Two of them, <em>Murphy v. Oklahoma</em> and <em>McGirt v. Oklahoma, </em>centered on crimes on land that the state of Oklahoma argued was no longer part of the Muscogee and Cherokee Nations\u2019 respective reservations. In both cases, the Supreme Court upheld the tribes\u2019 arguments in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. But shortly after came <em>Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta</em>, in which the Supreme Court sidestepped a century of federal Indian law and gave states jurisdiction to prosecute crimes on tribal lands when the perpetrator was non-Native and the victim was Native. The connections Nagle makes span generations and offer insight into our current political turmoil, at a time when a second Trump administration is testing the limits of executive authority and the law.</p> <p>In a conversation with <em>High Country News</em>, Nagle discusses how the U.S. still wields its power of empire, what impact the Trump administration could have on tribal sovereignty, and the enduring weight of history.</p> <p><em>This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p> <p><strong><em>High Country News</em></strong>: <strong>In this book, you don\u2019t just focus on the 20-year histories of these three Supreme Court cases but also tell the stories of the Muscogee and Cherokee nations before the U.S. existed. Why did you decide to take such a long view?</strong></p> <p><strong>Rebecca Nagle:</strong> One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present. I also wanted people to get a sense of how history repeats itself, and how things like a lie that tribal land is lawless get used over and over again, or the excuse that, \u201cOh, <em>this</em> is actually what\u2019s best for Native people.\u201d I wanted people to be able to see and identify those patterns.&nbsp;</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present.</p> </blockquote> <p>When I found out about the <em>McGirt</em> decision and saw the implications that my tribe\u2019s reservation would be recognized again, it was a really overwhelming emotion of relief, of joy, but there was also a lot of sadness, because I knew how much my ancestors, and Cherokee ancestors in general, had sacrificed to reach this moment. I think that a lot of other tribal citizens felt that the day that we were celebrating the Supreme Court decision. I think we all felt that weight of history. And I wanted the reader to feel that weight of history \u2014 to understand this isn\u2019t a simple story of, \u201cYay, the tribes won!\u201d There\u2019s a lot that\u2019s implicated in that victory and a lot that was lost for that rare legal victory to happen.</p> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the book you hold multiple difficult truths at once, like how George Jacobs\u2019 death \u2014 which caused so much pain for his community \u2014 was the origin of the Murphy case and also resulted in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. Similarly, the truth of your ancestor, John Ridge, who signed a treaty that resulted in forced removal of the Cherokee people. It was against their wishes, and also what he thought he had to do to save his nation. How did you navigate that? It can be so easy to collapse these tensions to make for a simpler narrative.&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> Absolutely. As a journalist, my North Star is the truth. And I think the truth is complicated. I don\u2019t think we can tell the whole story of the <em>McGirt</em> victory without talking about the crimes and the tragedy that it originated in. And I think the same is true for my ancestors. I was sort of raised to think one thing, but I went back through the historical records and really tried to look at it for what it was. There\u2019s a lot that we can learn from the desperation of my ancestors and their decision to sign that treaty. We can learn just how violent U.S. policy was at that time, that they would make a decision like that.

And, unfortunately, the courts \u2014 dating back to before Trump \u2014 have not been reliable sources for justice for tribes. Even when the law is clearly on the tribe\u2019s side, courts have a very bad habit of bending and breaking the rules to satisfy the state or non-Native residents. One of the things that\u2019s really shocked me is how often our government institutions ignore the law when it comes to tribes and how hard tribes have to fight for just the law to be followed.

Smith, High Country NewsMarch 25, 2025<h1>Rebecca Nagle considers Supreme Court wins and what\u2019s at stake for tribes under Trump</h1> <p class=\"byline\">by Anna V. Smith, High Country News <br />March 25, 2025</p> <p class=\"has-drop-cap\">During the forced<strong> </strong>removal of Muscogee (Creek) people from their ancestral lands in the Southeastern U.S., tribal members carried the embers and ashes of their town fires with them, determined to re-establish the flames in the new communities they planned to build in what\u2019s now known as Oklahoma. Those fires still burn today in places on the Muscogee Reservation.</p> <div class=\"wp-block-group alignright\"> <!-- RTT removed image (333291) --> <p class=\"has-text-align-left\"><em><em>By the Fire We Carry</em> </em><br />By Rebecca Nagle<br />352 pages, hardcover: $30<br />Harper, 2024.</p> </p></div> <p>In <em>By the Fire We Carry</em>, Cherokee journalist Rebecca Nagle documents the interwoven stories of tribal land dispossession, forced removal, a murder in a small tribal community, her own family history and three recent and consequential Supreme Court decisions about tribal jurisdiction over lands in Oklahoma. Two of them, <em>Murphy v. Oklahoma</em> and <em>McGirt v. Oklahoma, </em>centered on crimes on land that the state of Oklahoma argued was no longer part of the Muscogee and Cherokee Nations\u2019 respective reservations. In both cases, the Supreme Court upheld the tribes\u2019 arguments in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. But shortly after came <em>Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta</em>, in which the Supreme Court sidestepped a century of federal Indian law and gave states jurisdiction to prosecute crimes on tribal lands when the perpetrator was non-Native and the victim was Native. The connections Nagle makes span generations and offer insight into our current political turmoil, at a time when a second Trump administration is testing the limits of executive authority and the law.</p> <p>In a conversation with <em>High Country News</em>, Nagle discusses how the U.S. still wields its power of empire, what impact the Trump administration could have on tribal sovereignty, and the enduring weight of history.</p> <p><em>This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p> <p><strong><em>High Country News</em></strong>: <strong>In this book, you don\u2019t just focus on the 20-year histories of these three Supreme Court cases but also tell the stories of the Muscogee and Cherokee nations before the U.S. existed. Why did you decide to take such a long view?</strong></p> <p><strong>Rebecca Nagle:</strong> One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present. I also wanted people to get a sense of how history repeats itself, and how things like a lie that tribal land is lawless get used over and over again, or the excuse that, \u201cOh, <em>this</em> is actually what\u2019s best for Native people.\u201d I wanted people to be able to see and identify those patterns.&nbsp;</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present.</p> </blockquote> <p>When I found out about the <em>McGirt</em> decision and saw the implications that my tribe\u2019s reservation would be recognized again, it was a really overwhelming emotion of relief, of joy, but there was also a lot of sadness, because I knew how much my ancestors, and Cherokee ancestors in general, had sacrificed to reach this moment. I think that a lot of other tribal citizens felt that the day that we were celebrating the Supreme Court decision. I think we all felt that weight of history. And I wanted the reader to feel that weight of history \u2014 to understand this isn\u2019t a simple story of, \u201cYay, the tribes won!\u201d There\u2019s a lot that\u2019s implicated in that victory and a lot that was lost for that rare legal victory to happen.</p> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the book you hold multiple difficult truths at once, like how George Jacobs\u2019 death \u2014 which caused so much pain for his community \u2014 was the origin of the Murphy case and also resulted in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. Similarly, the truth of your ancestor, John Ridge, who signed a treaty that resulted in forced removal of the Cherokee people. It was against their wishes, and also what he thought he had to do to save his nation. How did you navigate that? It can be so easy to collapse these tensions to make for a simpler narrative.&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> Absolutely. As a journalist, my North Star is the truth. And I think the truth is complicated. I don\u2019t think we can tell the whole story of the <em>McGirt</em> victory without talking about the crimes and the tragedy that it originated in. And I think the same is true for my ancestors. I was sort of raised to think one thing, but I went back through the historical records and really tried to look at it for what it was. There\u2019s a lot that we can learn from the desperation of my ancestors and their decision to sign that treaty. We can learn just how violent U.S. policy was at that time, that they would make a decision like that. There\u2019s a cultural impulse to tell stories where there are clear heroes and clear villains, and victories like <em>McGirt</em> come from a good place, and things are clean-cut. I think that history is actually quite messy. I wanted a book that reflected that reality.</p> <!-- RTT removed image (333265) --> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the aftermath of the McGirt decision, the state of Oklahoma pushed a narrative of chaos and disruption in the criminal justice system, which some national outlets then repeated without much discernment.

Less than a fraction of a percent of the people staffing newsrooms are Native. Coverage of Indigenous issues very often fails to meet the standards of journalism. It doesn\u2019t have context, or a depth of knowledge of what\u2019s going on. They send reporters who\u2019ve never been on a reservation to do reporting about criminal justice on tribal land.

I did some digging around with a fellow reporter, Allison Herrera, and Oklahoma\u2019s claims fell apart completely. But they were still repeated and cited by prominent outlets like the <em>Washington Post</em> and <em>The Wall Street Journal.</em> Oklahoma then cited those articles in their briefs, and some of that inaccurate information was actually in the (<em>Castro-Huerta</em>) Supreme Court decision. And so it was this tornado of disinformation that made it all the way up to the Supreme Court. Normally, we think that the <em>Washington Post</em> is a check on bad information, but not when it comes to tribes, which should be an embarrassment for them.</p> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>We\u2019re in a moment of major law and policy change under a new administration. What are some lessons from your reporting that apply to our current moment?</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> We talk about it as a problem that originates with Trump, instead of a problem that originates with some of the flaws in our democracy. And I think the treatment of Indigenous nations is a glaring example of that, because we\u2019ve never had any kind of constitutional amendment or reform to change those laws and to change those policies. To dispossess Indigenous people of their land, the U.S. government gave itself a lot of power over people who are not U.S. citizens. That power of empire is embedded in our Constitution, because our country wanted to take Indigenous land. We still see it manifested in deportation and shutting down asylum and separating families at the border and banning Muslims from entering our country. If we really don\u2019t want these types of policies to be enacted, there are some bigger questions about our democracy that as a society we haven\u2019t even begun to ask.</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p> If we really don\u2019t want these types of policies to be enacted, there are some bigger questions about our democracy that as a society we haven\u2019t even begun to ask.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>Given that, do you have any specific concerns about potential attacks on tribal sovereignty under a second Trump administration?</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> Everything has the capacity to get worse.

Smith, High Country NewsMarch 25, 2025<h1>Rebecca Nagle considers Supreme Court wins and what\u2019s at stake for tribes under Trump</h1> <p class=\"byline\">by Anna V. Smith, High Country News <br />March 25, 2025</p> <p class=\"has-drop-cap\">During the forced<strong> </strong>removal of Muscogee (Creek) people from their ancestral lands in the Southeastern U.S., tribal members carried the embers and ashes of their town fires with them, determined to re-establish the flames in the new communities they planned to build in what\u2019s now known as Oklahoma. Those fires still burn today in places on the Muscogee Reservation.</p> <div class=\"wp-block-group alignright\"> <!-- RTT removed image (333291) --> <p class=\"has-text-align-left\"><em><em>By the Fire We Carry</em> </em><br />By Rebecca Nagle<br />352 pages, hardcover: $30<br />Harper, 2024.</p> </p></div> <p>In <em>By the Fire We Carry</em>, Cherokee journalist Rebecca Nagle documents the interwoven stories of tribal land dispossession, forced removal, a murder in a small tribal community, her own family history and three recent and consequential Supreme Court decisions about tribal jurisdiction over lands in Oklahoma. Two of them, <em>Murphy v. Oklahoma</em> and <em>McGirt v. Oklahoma, </em>centered on crimes on land that the state of Oklahoma argued was no longer part of the Muscogee and Cherokee Nations\u2019 respective reservations. In both cases, the Supreme Court upheld the tribes\u2019 arguments in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. But shortly after came <em>Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta</em>, in which the Supreme Court sidestepped a century of federal Indian law and gave states jurisdiction to prosecute crimes on tribal lands when the perpetrator was non-Native and the victim was Native. The connections Nagle makes span generations and offer insight into our current political turmoil, at a time when a second Trump administration is testing the limits of executive authority and the law.</p> <p>In a conversation with <em>High Country News</em>, Nagle discusses how the U.S. still wields its power of empire, what impact the Trump administration could have on tribal sovereignty, and the enduring weight of history.</p> <p><em>This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p> <p><strong><em>High Country News</em></strong>: <strong>In this book, you don\u2019t just focus on the 20-year histories of these three Supreme Court cases but also tell the stories of the Muscogee and Cherokee nations before the U.S. existed. Why did you decide to take such a long view?</strong></p> <p><strong>Rebecca Nagle:</strong> One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present. I also wanted people to get a sense of how history repeats itself, and how things like a lie that tribal land is lawless get used over and over again, or the excuse that, \u201cOh, <em>this</em> is actually what\u2019s best for Native people.\u201d I wanted people to be able to see and identify those patterns.&nbsp;</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present.</p> </blockquote> <p>When I found out about the <em>McGirt</em> decision and saw the implications that my tribe\u2019s reservation would be recognized again, it was a really overwhelming emotion of relief, of joy, but there was also a lot of sadness, because I knew how much my ancestors, and Cherokee ancestors in general, had sacrificed to reach this moment.

Smith, High Country NewsMarch 25, 2025<h1>Rebecca Nagle considers Supreme Court wins and what\u2019s at stake for tribes under Trump</h1> <p class=\"byline\">by Anna V. Smith, High Country News <br />March 25, 2025</p> <p class=\"has-drop-cap\">During the forced<strong> </strong>removal of Muscogee (Creek) people from their ancestral lands in the Southeastern U.S., tribal members carried the embers and ashes of their town fires with them, determined to re-establish the flames in the new communities they planned to build in what\u2019s now known as Oklahoma. Those fires still burn today in places on the Muscogee Reservation.</p> <div class=\"wp-block-group alignright\"> <!-- RTT removed image (333291) --> <p class=\"has-text-align-left\"><em><em>By the Fire We Carry</em> </em><br />By Rebecca Nagle<br />352 pages, hardcover: $30<br />Harper, 2024.</p> </p></div> <p>In <em>By the Fire We Carry</em>, Cherokee journalist Rebecca Nagle documents the interwoven stories of tribal land dispossession, forced removal, a murder in a small tribal community, her own family history and three recent and consequential Supreme Court decisions about tribal jurisdiction over lands in Oklahoma. Two of them, <em>Murphy v. Oklahoma</em> and <em>McGirt v. Oklahoma, </em>centered on crimes on land that the state of Oklahoma argued was no longer part of the Muscogee and Cherokee Nations\u2019 respective reservations. In both cases, the Supreme Court upheld the tribes\u2019 arguments in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. But shortly after came <em>Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta</em>, in which the Supreme Court sidestepped a century of federal Indian law and gave states jurisdiction to prosecute crimes on tribal lands when the perpetrator was non-Native and the victim was Native. The connections Nagle makes span generations and offer insight into our current political turmoil, at a time when a second Trump administration is testing the limits of executive authority and the law.</p> <p>In a conversation with <em>High Country News</em>, Nagle discusses how the U.S. still wields its power of empire, what impact the Trump administration could have on tribal sovereignty, and the enduring weight of history.</p> <p><em>This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p> <p><strong><em>High Country News</em></strong>: <strong>In this book, you don\u2019t just focus on the 20-year histories of these three Supreme Court cases but also tell the stories of the Muscogee and Cherokee nations before the U.S. existed. Why did you decide to take such a long view?</strong></p> <p><strong>Rebecca Nagle:</strong> One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present. I also wanted people to get a sense of how history repeats itself, and how things like a lie that tribal land is lawless get used over and over again, or the excuse that, \u201cOh, <em>this</em> is actually what\u2019s best for Native people.\u201d I wanted people to be able to see and identify those patterns.&nbsp;</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present.</p> </blockquote> <p>When I found out about the <em>McGirt</em> decision and saw the implications that my tribe\u2019s reservation would be recognized again, it was a really overwhelming emotion of relief, of joy, but there was also a lot of sadness, because I knew how much my ancestors, and Cherokee ancestors in general, had sacrificed to reach this moment. I think that a lot of other tribal citizens felt that the day that we were celebrating the Supreme Court decision. I think we all felt that weight of history. And I wanted the reader to feel that weight of history \u2014 to understand this isn\u2019t a simple story of, \u201cYay, the tribes won!\u201d There\u2019s a lot that\u2019s implicated in that victory and a lot that was lost for that rare legal victory to happen.</p> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the book you hold multiple difficult truths at once, like how George Jacobs\u2019 death \u2014 which caused so much pain for his community \u2014 was the origin of the Murphy case and also resulted in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. Similarly, the truth of your ancestor, John Ridge, who signed a treaty that resulted in forced removal of the Cherokee people.

Smith, High Country NewsMarch 25, 2025<h1>Rebecca Nagle considers Supreme Court wins and what\u2019s at stake for tribes under Trump</h1> <p class=\"byline\">by Anna V. Smith, High Country News <br />March 25, 2025</p> <p class=\"has-drop-cap\">During the forced<strong> </strong>removal of Muscogee (Creek) people from their ancestral lands in the Southeastern U.S., tribal members carried the embers and ashes of their town fires with them, determined to re-establish the flames in the new communities they planned to build in what\u2019s now known as Oklahoma. Those fires still burn today in places on the Muscogee Reservation.</p> <div class=\"wp-block-group alignright\"> <!-- RTT removed image (333291) --> <p class=\"has-text-align-left\"><em><em>By the Fire We Carry</em> </em><br />By Rebecca Nagle<br />352 pages, hardcover: $30<br />Harper, 2024.</p> </p></div> <p>In <em>By the Fire We Carry</em>, Cherokee journalist Rebecca Nagle documents the interwoven stories of tribal land dispossession, forced removal, a murder in a small tribal community, her own family history and three recent and consequential Supreme Court decisions about tribal jurisdiction over lands in Oklahoma. Two of them, <em>Murphy v. Oklahoma</em> and <em>McGirt v. Oklahoma, </em>centered on crimes on land that the state of Oklahoma argued was no longer part of the Muscogee and Cherokee Nations\u2019 respective reservations. In both cases, the Supreme Court upheld the tribes\u2019 arguments in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. But shortly after came <em>Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta</em>, in which the Supreme Court sidestepped a century of federal Indian law and gave states jurisdiction to prosecute crimes on tribal lands when the perpetrator was non-Native and the victim was Native. The connections Nagle makes span generations and offer insight into our current political turmoil, at a time when a second Trump administration is testing the limits of executive authority and the law.</p> <p>In a conversation with <em>High Country News</em>, Nagle discusses how the U.S. still wields its power of empire, what impact the Trump administration could have on tribal sovereignty, and the enduring weight of history.</p> <p><em>This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p> <p><strong><em>High Country News</em></strong>: <strong>In this book, you don\u2019t just focus on the 20-year histories of these three Supreme Court cases but also tell the stories of the Muscogee and Cherokee nations before the U.S. existed. Why did you decide to take such a long view?</strong></p> <p><strong>Rebecca Nagle:</strong> One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present. I also wanted people to get a sense of how history repeats itself, and how things like a lie that tribal land is lawless get used over and over again, or the excuse that, \u201cOh, <em>this</em> is actually what\u2019s best for Native people.\u201d I wanted people to be able to see and identify those patterns.&nbsp;</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present.</p> </blockquote> <p>When I found out about the <em>McGirt</em> decision and saw the implications that my tribe\u2019s reservation would be recognized again, it was a really overwhelming emotion of relief, of joy, but there was also a lot of sadness, because I knew how much my ancestors, and Cherokee ancestors in general, had sacrificed to reach this moment. I think that a lot of other tribal citizens felt that the day that we were celebrating the Supreme Court decision. I think we all felt that weight of history. And I wanted the reader to feel that weight of history \u2014 to understand this isn\u2019t a simple story of, \u201cYay, the tribes won!\u201d There\u2019s a lot that\u2019s implicated in that victory and a lot that was lost for that rare legal victory to happen.</p> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the book you hold multiple difficult truths at once, like how George Jacobs\u2019 death \u2014 which caused so much pain for his community \u2014 was the origin of the Murphy case and also resulted in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. Similarly, the truth of your ancestor, John Ridge, who signed a treaty that resulted in forced removal of the Cherokee people. It was against their wishes, and also what he thought he had to do to save his nation. How did you navigate that? It can be so easy to collapse these tensions to make for a simpler narrative.&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> Absolutely. As a journalist, my North Star is the truth. And I think the truth is complicated. I don\u2019t think we can tell the whole story of the <em>McGirt</em> victory without talking about the crimes and the tragedy that it originated in. And I think the same is true for my ancestors. I was sort of raised to think one thing, but I went back through the historical records and really tried to look at it for what it was. There\u2019s a lot that we can learn from the desperation of my ancestors and their decision to sign that treaty. We can learn just how violent U.S. policy was at that time, that they would make a decision like that. There\u2019s a cultural impulse to tell stories where there are clear heroes and clear villains, and victories like <em>McGirt</em> come from a good place, and things are clean-cut. I think that history is actually quite messy. I wanted a book that reflected that reality.</p> <!-- RTT removed image (333265) --> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the aftermath of the McGirt decision, the state of Oklahoma pushed a narrative of chaos and disruption in the criminal justice system, which some national outlets then repeated without much discernment.

Smith, High Country NewsMarch 25, 2025<h1>Rebecca Nagle considers Supreme Court wins and what\u2019s at stake for tribes under Trump</h1> <p class=\"byline\">by Anna V. Smith, High Country News <br />March 25, 2025</p> <p class=\"has-drop-cap\">During the forced<strong> </strong>removal of Muscogee (Creek) people from their ancestral lands in the Southeastern U.S., tribal members carried the embers and ashes of their town fires with them, determined to re-establish the flames in the new communities they planned to build in what\u2019s now known as Oklahoma. Those fires still burn today in places on the Muscogee Reservation.</p> <div class=\"wp-block-group alignright\"> <!-- RTT removed image (333291) --> <p class=\"has-text-align-left\"><em><em>By the Fire We Carry</em> </em><br />By Rebecca Nagle<br />352 pages, hardcover: $30<br />Harper, 2024.</p> </p></div> <p>In <em>By the Fire We Carry</em>, Cherokee journalist Rebecca Nagle documents the interwoven stories of tribal land dispossession, forced removal, a murder in a small tribal community, her own family history and three recent and consequential Supreme Court decisions about tribal jurisdiction over lands in Oklahoma. Two of them, <em>Murphy v. Oklahoma</em> and <em>McGirt v. Oklahoma, </em>centered on crimes on land that the state of Oklahoma argued was no longer part of the Muscogee and Cherokee Nations\u2019 respective reservations. In both cases, the Supreme Court upheld the tribes\u2019 arguments in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. But shortly after came <em>Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta</em>, in which the Supreme Court sidestepped a century of federal Indian law and gave states jurisdiction to prosecute crimes on tribal lands when the perpetrator was non-Native and the victim was Native. The connections Nagle makes span generations and offer insight into our current political turmoil, at a time when a second Trump administration is testing the limits of executive authority and the law.</p> <p>In a conversation with <em>High Country News</em>, Nagle discusses how the U.S. still wields its power of empire, what impact the Trump administration could have on tribal sovereignty, and the enduring weight of history.</p> <p><em>This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p> <p><strong><em>High Country News</em></strong>: <strong>In this book, you don\u2019t just focus on the 20-year histories of these three Supreme Court cases but also tell the stories of the Muscogee and Cherokee nations before the U.S. existed. Why did you decide to take such a long view?</strong></p> <p><strong>Rebecca Nagle:</strong> One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present. I also wanted people to get a sense of how history repeats itself, and how things like a lie that tribal land is lawless get used over and over again, or the excuse that, \u201cOh, <em>this</em> is actually what\u2019s best for Native people.\u201d I wanted people to be able to see and identify those patterns.&nbsp;</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present.</p> </blockquote> <p>When I found out about the <em>McGirt</em> decision and saw the implications that my tribe\u2019s reservation would be recognized again, it was a really overwhelming emotion of relief, of joy, but there was also a lot of sadness, because I knew how much my ancestors, and Cherokee ancestors in general, had sacrificed to reach this moment. I think that a lot of other tribal citizens felt that the day that we were celebrating the Supreme Court decision. I think we all felt that weight of history. And I wanted the reader to feel that weight of history \u2014 to understand this isn\u2019t a simple story of, \u201cYay, the tribes won!\u201d There\u2019s a lot that\u2019s implicated in that victory and a lot that was lost for that rare legal victory to happen.</p> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the book you hold multiple difficult truths at once, like how George Jacobs\u2019 death \u2014 which caused so much pain for his community \u2014 was the origin of the Murphy case and also resulted in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. Similarly, the truth of your ancestor, John Ridge, who signed a treaty that resulted in forced removal of the Cherokee people. It was against their wishes, and also what he thought he had to do to save his nation. How did you navigate that? It can be so easy to collapse these tensions to make for a simpler narrative.&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> Absolutely. As a journalist, my North Star is the truth. And I think the truth is complicated. I don\u2019t think we can tell the whole story of the <em>McGirt</em> victory without talking about the crimes and the tragedy that it originated in. And I think the same is true for my ancestors. I was sort of raised to think one thing, but I went back through the historical records and really tried to look at it for what it was. There\u2019s a lot that we can learn from the desperation of my ancestors and their decision to sign that treaty. We can learn just how violent U.S. policy was at that time, that they would make a decision like that. There\u2019s a cultural impulse to tell stories where there are clear heroes and clear villains, and victories like <em>McGirt</em> come from a good place, and things are clean-cut. I think that history is actually quite messy. I wanted a book that reflected that reality.</p> <!-- RTT removed image (333265) --> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the aftermath of the McGirt decision, the state of Oklahoma pushed a narrative of chaos and disruption in the criminal justice system, which some national outlets then repeated without much discernment. Can you talk about the role of the media \u2014 including the lack of Indigenous representation in newsrooms \u2014 and how that shapes the public\u2019s understanding of things like tribal sovereignty?</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> I think that it\u2019s a really big hindrance to our rights as Indigenous nations and to our sovereignty. Less than a fraction of a percent of the people staffing newsrooms are Native. Coverage of Indigenous issues very often fails to meet the standards of journalism. It doesn\u2019t have context, or a depth of knowledge of what\u2019s going on. They send reporters who\u2019ve never been on a reservation to do reporting about criminal justice on tribal land. It creates an environment where you can tell lies about tribes, and people will think that it\u2019s true.</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> </blockquote> <p>And unfortunately, that\u2019s what happened. In the wake of <em>McGirt</em>, (Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, R) made some very bold and outlandish claims about the number of criminal cases that could be prosecuted moving forward. I did some digging around with a fellow reporter, Allison Herrera, and Oklahoma\u2019s claims fell apart completely. But they were still repeated and cited by prominent outlets like the <em>Washington Post</em> and <em>The Wall Street Journal.</em> Oklahoma then cited those articles in their briefs, and some of that inaccurate information was actually in the (<em>Castro-Huerta</em>) Supreme Court decision. And so it was this tornado of disinformation that made it all the way up to the Supreme Court. Normally, we think that the <em>Washington Post</em> is a check on bad information, but not when it comes to tribes, which should be an embarrassment for them.</p> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>We\u2019re in a moment of major law and policy change under a new administration. What are some lessons from your reporting that apply to our current moment?</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> We talk about it as a problem that originates with Trump, instead of a problem that originates with some of the flaws in our democracy. And I think the treatment of Indigenous nations is a glaring example of that, because we\u2019ve never had any kind of constitutional amendment or reform to change those laws and to change those policies. To dispossess Indigenous people of their land, the U.S. government gave itself a lot of power over people who are not U.S. citizens. That power of empire is embedded in our Constitution, because our country wanted to take Indigenous land. We still see it manifested in deportation and shutting down asylum and separating families at the border and banning Muslims from entering our country. If we really don\u2019t want these types of policies to be enacted, there are some bigger questions about our democracy that as a society we haven\u2019t even begun to ask.</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p> If we really don\u2019t want these types of policies to be enacted, there are some bigger questions about our democracy that as a society we haven\u2019t even begun to ask.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>Given that, do you have any specific concerns about potential attacks on tribal sovereignty under a second Trump administration?</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> Everything has the capacity to get worse.

And, unfortunately, the courts \u2014 dating back to before Trump \u2014 have not been reliable sources for justice for tribes. Even when the law is clearly on the tribe\u2019s side, courts have a very bad habit of bending and breaking the rules to satisfy the state or non-Native residents. One of the things that\u2019s really shocked me is how often our government institutions ignore the law when it comes to tribes and how hard tribes have to fight for just the law to be followed.

There\u2019s a lot specifically at stake for tribes under Trump. The remaking of the federal judiciary has a profound impact on tribes, because our cases are federal; they don\u2019t go through state court.

Smith, High Country NewsMarch 25, 2025<h1>Rebecca Nagle considers Supreme Court wins and what\u2019s at stake for tribes under Trump</h1> <p class=\"byline\">by Anna V. Smith, High Country News <br />March 25, 2025</p> <p class=\"has-drop-cap\">During the forced<strong> </strong>removal of Muscogee (Creek) people from their ancestral lands in the Southeastern U.S., tribal members carried the embers and ashes of their town fires with them, determined to re-establish the flames in the new communities they planned to build in what\u2019s now known as Oklahoma. Those fires still burn today in places on the Muscogee Reservation.</p> <div class=\"wp-block-group alignright\"> <!-- RTT removed image (333291) --> <p class=\"has-text-align-left\"><em><em>By the Fire We Carry</em> </em><br />By Rebecca Nagle<br />352 pages, hardcover: $30<br />Harper, 2024.</p> </p></div> <p>In <em>By the Fire We Carry</em>, Cherokee journalist Rebecca Nagle documents the interwoven stories of tribal land dispossession, forced removal, a murder in a small tribal community, her own family history and three recent and consequential Supreme Court decisions about tribal jurisdiction over lands in Oklahoma. Two of them, <em>Murphy v. Oklahoma</em> and <em>McGirt v. Oklahoma, </em>centered on crimes on land that the state of Oklahoma argued was no longer part of the Muscogee and Cherokee Nations\u2019 respective reservations. In both cases, the Supreme Court upheld the tribes\u2019 arguments in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. But shortly after came <em>Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta</em>, in which the Supreme Court sidestepped a century of federal Indian law and gave states jurisdiction to prosecute crimes on tribal lands when the perpetrator was non-Native and the victim was Native. The connections Nagle makes span generations and offer insight into our current political turmoil, at a time when a second Trump administration is testing the limits of executive authority and the law.</p> <p>In a conversation with <em>High Country News</em>, Nagle discusses how the U.S. still wields its power of empire, what impact the Trump administration could have on tribal sovereignty, and the enduring weight of history.</p> <p><em>This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p> <p><strong><em>High Country News</em></strong>: <strong>In this book, you don\u2019t just focus on the 20-year histories of these three Supreme Court cases but also tell the stories of the Muscogee and Cherokee nations before the U.S. existed. Why did you decide to take such a long view?</strong></p> <p><strong>Rebecca Nagle:</strong> One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present. I also wanted people to get a sense of how history repeats itself, and how things like a lie that tribal land is lawless get used over and over again, or the excuse that, \u201cOh, <em>this</em> is actually what\u2019s best for Native people.\u201d I wanted people to be able to see and identify those patterns.&nbsp;</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present.</p> </blockquote> <p>When I found out about the <em>McGirt</em> decision and saw the implications that my tribe\u2019s reservation would be recognized again, it was a really overwhelming emotion of relief, of joy, but there was also a lot of sadness, because I knew how much my ancestors, and Cherokee ancestors in general, had sacrificed to reach this moment. I think that a lot of other tribal citizens felt that the day that we were celebrating the Supreme Court decision. I think we all felt that weight of history. And I wanted the reader to feel that weight of history \u2014 to understand this isn\u2019t a simple story of, \u201cYay, the tribes won!\u201d There\u2019s a lot that\u2019s implicated in that victory and a lot that was lost for that rare legal victory to happen.</p> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the book you hold multiple difficult truths at once, like how George Jacobs\u2019 death \u2014 which caused so much pain for his community \u2014 was the origin of the Murphy case and also resulted in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. Similarly, the truth of your ancestor, John Ridge, who signed a treaty that resulted in forced removal of the Cherokee people. It was against their wishes, and also what he thought he had to do to save his nation. How did you navigate that? It can be so easy to collapse these tensions to make for a simpler narrative.&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> Absolutely. As a journalist, my North Star is the truth. And I think the truth is complicated. I don\u2019t think we can tell the whole story of the <em>McGirt</em> victory without talking about the crimes and the tragedy that it originated in. And I think the same is true for my ancestors. I was sort of raised to think one thing, but I went back through the historical records and really tried to look at it for what it was. There\u2019s a lot that we can learn from the desperation of my ancestors and their decision to sign that treaty. We can learn just how violent U.S. policy was at that time, that they would make a decision like that. There\u2019s a cultural impulse to tell stories where there are clear heroes and clear villains, and victories like <em>McGirt</em> come from a good place, and things are clean-cut. I think that history is actually quite messy. I wanted a book that reflected that reality.</p> <!-- RTT removed image (333265) --> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the aftermath of the McGirt decision, the state of Oklahoma pushed a narrative of chaos and disruption in the criminal justice system, which some national outlets then repeated without much discernment. Can you talk about the role of the media \u2014 including the lack of Indigenous representation in newsrooms \u2014 and how that shapes the public\u2019s understanding of things like tribal sovereignty?</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> I think that it\u2019s a really big hindrance to our rights as Indigenous nations and to our sovereignty. Less than a fraction of a percent of the people staffing newsrooms are Native. Coverage of Indigenous issues very often fails to meet the standards of journalism. It doesn\u2019t have context, or a depth of knowledge of what\u2019s going on. They send reporters who\u2019ve never been on a reservation to do reporting about criminal justice on tribal land. It creates an environment where you can tell lies about tribes, and people will think that it\u2019s true.</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> </blockquote> <p>And unfortunately, that\u2019s what happened. In the wake of <em>McGirt</em>, (Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, R) made some very bold and outlandish claims about the number of criminal cases that could be prosecuted moving forward. I did some digging around with a fellow reporter, Allison Herrera, and Oklahoma\u2019s claims fell apart completely. But they were still repeated and cited by prominent outlets like the <em>Washington Post</em> and <em>The Wall Street Journal.</em> Oklahoma then cited those articles in their briefs, and some of that inaccurate information was actually in the (<em>Castro-Huerta</em>) Supreme Court decision. And so it was this tornado of disinformation that made it all the way up to the Supreme Court. Normally, we think that the <em>Washington Post</em> is a check on bad information, but not when it comes to tribes, which should be an embarrassment for them.</p> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>We\u2019re in a moment of major law and policy change under a new administration.

Smith, High Country NewsMarch 25, 2025<h1>Rebecca Nagle considers Supreme Court wins and what\u2019s at stake for tribes under Trump</h1> <p class=\"byline\">by Anna V. Smith, High Country News <br />March 25, 2025</p> <p class=\"has-drop-cap\">During the forced<strong> </strong>removal of Muscogee (Creek) people from their ancestral lands in the Southeastern U.S., tribal members carried the embers and ashes of their town fires with them, determined to re-establish the flames in the new communities they planned to build in what\u2019s now known as Oklahoma. Those fires still burn today in places on the Muscogee Reservation.</p> <div class=\"wp-block-group alignright\"> <!-- RTT removed image (333291) --> <p class=\"has-text-align-left\"><em><em>By the Fire We Carry</em> </em><br />By Rebecca Nagle<br />352 pages, hardcover: $30<br />Harper, 2024.</p> </p></div> <p>In <em>By the Fire We Carry</em>, Cherokee journalist Rebecca Nagle documents the interwoven stories of tribal land dispossession, forced removal, a murder in a small tribal community, her own family history and three recent and consequential Supreme Court decisions about tribal jurisdiction over lands in Oklahoma. Two of them, <em>Murphy v. Oklahoma</em> and <em>McGirt v. Oklahoma, </em>centered on crimes on land that the state of Oklahoma argued was no longer part of the Muscogee and Cherokee Nations\u2019 respective reservations. In both cases, the Supreme Court upheld the tribes\u2019 arguments in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. But shortly after came <em>Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta</em>, in which the Supreme Court sidestepped a century of federal Indian law and gave states jurisdiction to prosecute crimes on tribal lands when the perpetrator was non-Native and the victim was Native. The connections Nagle makes span generations and offer insight into our current political turmoil, at a time when a second Trump administration is testing the limits of executive authority and the law.</p> <p>In a conversation with <em>High Country News</em>, Nagle discusses how the U.S. still wields its power of empire, what impact the Trump administration could have on tribal sovereignty, and the enduring weight of history.</p> <p><em>This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p> <p><strong><em>High Country News</em></strong>: <strong>In this book, you don\u2019t just focus on the 20-year histories of these three Supreme Court cases but also tell the stories of the Muscogee and Cherokee nations before the U.S. existed. Why did you decide to take such a long view?</strong></p> <p><strong>Rebecca Nagle:</strong> One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present. I also wanted people to get a sense of how history repeats itself, and how things like a lie that tribal land is lawless get used over and over again, or the excuse that, \u201cOh, <em>this</em> is actually what\u2019s best for Native people.\u201d I wanted people to be able to see and identify those patterns.&nbsp;</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present.</p> </blockquote> <p>When I found out about the <em>McGirt</em> decision and saw the implications that my tribe\u2019s reservation would be recognized again, it was a really overwhelming emotion of relief, of joy, but there was also a lot of sadness, because I knew how much my ancestors, and Cherokee ancestors in general, had sacrificed to reach this moment. I think that a lot of other tribal citizens felt that the day that we were celebrating the Supreme Court decision. I think we all felt that weight of history. And I wanted the reader to feel that weight of history \u2014 to understand this isn\u2019t a simple story of, \u201cYay, the tribes won!\u201d There\u2019s a lot that\u2019s implicated in that victory and a lot that was lost for that rare legal victory to happen.</p> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the book you hold multiple difficult truths at once, like how George Jacobs\u2019 death \u2014 which caused so much pain for his community \u2014 was the origin of the Murphy case and also resulted in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. Similarly, the truth of your ancestor, John Ridge, who signed a treaty that resulted in forced removal of the Cherokee people. It was against their wishes, and also what he thought he had to do to save his nation. How did you navigate that? It can be so easy to collapse these tensions to make for a simpler narrative.&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> Absolutely. As a journalist, my North Star is the truth. And I think the truth is complicated. I don\u2019t think we can tell the whole story of the <em>McGirt</em> victory without talking about the crimes and the tragedy that it originated in. And I think the same is true for my ancestors. I was sort of raised to think one thing, but I went back through the historical records and really tried to look at it for what it was. There\u2019s a lot that we can learn from the desperation of my ancestors and their decision to sign that treaty. We can learn just how violent U.S. policy was at that time, that they would make a decision like that. There\u2019s a cultural impulse to tell stories where there are clear heroes and clear villains, and victories like <em>McGirt</em> come from a good place, and things are clean-cut. I think that history is actually quite messy.

Smith, High Country NewsMarch 25, 2025<h1>Rebecca Nagle considers Supreme Court wins and what\u2019s at stake for tribes under Trump</h1> <p class=\"byline\">by Anna V. Smith, High Country News <br />March 25, 2025</p> <p class=\"has-drop-cap\">During the forced<strong> </strong>removal of Muscogee (Creek) people from their ancestral lands in the Southeastern U.S., tribal members carried the embers and ashes of their town fires with them, determined to re-establish the flames in the new communities they planned to build in what\u2019s now known as Oklahoma. Those fires still burn today in places on the Muscogee Reservation.</p> <div class=\"wp-block-group alignright\"> <!-- RTT removed image (333291) --> <p class=\"has-text-align-left\"><em><em>By the Fire We Carry</em> </em><br />By Rebecca Nagle<br />352 pages, hardcover: $30<br />Harper, 2024.</p> </p></div> <p>In <em>By the Fire We Carry</em>, Cherokee journalist Rebecca Nagle documents the interwoven stories of tribal land dispossession, forced removal, a murder in a small tribal community, her own family history and three recent and consequential Supreme Court decisions about tribal jurisdiction over lands in Oklahoma. Two of them, <em>Murphy v. Oklahoma</em> and <em>McGirt v. Oklahoma, </em>centered on crimes on land that the state of Oklahoma argued was no longer part of the Muscogee and Cherokee Nations\u2019 respective reservations. In both cases, the Supreme Court upheld the tribes\u2019 arguments in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. But shortly after came <em>Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta</em>, in which the Supreme Court sidestepped a century of federal Indian law and gave states jurisdiction to prosecute crimes on tribal lands when the perpetrator was non-Native and the victim was Native. The connections Nagle makes span generations and offer insight into our current political turmoil, at a time when a second Trump administration is testing the limits of executive authority and the law.</p> <p>In a conversation with <em>High Country News</em>, Nagle discusses how the U.S. still wields its power of empire, what impact the Trump administration could have on tribal sovereignty, and the enduring weight of history.</p> <p><em>This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p> <p><strong><em>High Country News</em></strong>: <strong>In this book, you don\u2019t just focus on the 20-year histories of these three Supreme Court cases but also tell the stories of the Muscogee and Cherokee nations before the U.S. existed. Why did you decide to take such a long view?</strong></p> <p><strong>Rebecca Nagle:</strong> One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present. I also wanted people to get a sense of how history repeats itself, and how things like a lie that tribal land is lawless get used over and over again, or the excuse that, \u201cOh, <em>this</em> is actually what\u2019s best for Native people.\u201d I wanted people to be able to see and identify those patterns.&nbsp;</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present.</p> </blockquote> <p>When I found out about the <em>McGirt</em> decision and saw the implications that my tribe\u2019s reservation would be recognized again, it was a really overwhelming emotion of relief, of joy, but there was also a lot of sadness, because I knew how much my ancestors, and Cherokee ancestors in general, had sacrificed to reach this moment. I think that a lot of other tribal citizens felt that the day that we were celebrating the Supreme Court decision. I think we all felt that weight of history. And I wanted the reader to feel that weight of history \u2014 to understand this isn\u2019t a simple story of, \u201cYay, the tribes won!\u201d There\u2019s a lot that\u2019s implicated in that victory and a lot that was lost for that rare legal victory to happen.</p> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the book you hold multiple difficult truths at once, like how George Jacobs\u2019 death \u2014 which caused so much pain for his community \u2014 was the origin of the Murphy case and also resulted in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. Similarly, the truth of your ancestor, John Ridge, who signed a treaty that resulted in forced removal of the Cherokee people. It was against their wishes, and also what he thought he had to do to save his nation. How did you navigate that? It can be so easy to collapse these tensions to make for a simpler narrative.&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> Absolutely. As a journalist, my North Star is the truth. And I think the truth is complicated. I don\u2019t think we can tell the whole story of the <em>McGirt</em> victory without talking about the crimes and the tragedy that it originated in. And I think the same is true for my ancestors. I was sort of raised to think one thing, but I went back through the historical records and really tried to look at it for what it was. There\u2019s a lot that we can learn from the desperation of my ancestors and their decision to sign that treaty. We can learn just how violent U.S. policy was at that time, that they would make a decision like that.

Smith, High Country NewsMarch 25, 2025<h1>Rebecca Nagle considers Supreme Court wins and what\u2019s at stake for tribes under Trump</h1> <p class=\"byline\">by Anna V. Smith, High Country News <br />March 25, 2025</p> <p class=\"has-drop-cap\">During the forced<strong> </strong>removal of Muscogee (Creek) people from their ancestral lands in the Southeastern U.S., tribal members carried the embers and ashes of their town fires with them, determined to re-establish the flames in the new communities they planned to build in what\u2019s now known as Oklahoma. Those fires still burn today in places on the Muscogee Reservation.</p> <div class=\"wp-block-group alignright\"> <!-- RTT removed image (333291) --> <p class=\"has-text-align-left\"><em><em>By the Fire We Carry</em> </em><br />By Rebecca Nagle<br />352 pages, hardcover: $30<br />Harper, 2024.</p> </p></div> <p>In <em>By the Fire We Carry</em>, Cherokee journalist Rebecca Nagle documents the interwoven stories of tribal land dispossession, forced removal, a murder in a small tribal community, her own family history and three recent and consequential Supreme Court decisions about tribal jurisdiction over lands in Oklahoma. Two of them, <em>Murphy v. Oklahoma</em> and <em>McGirt v. Oklahoma, </em>centered on crimes on land that the state of Oklahoma argued was no longer part of the Muscogee and Cherokee Nations\u2019 respective reservations. In both cases, the Supreme Court upheld the tribes\u2019 arguments in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. But shortly after came <em>Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta</em>, in which the Supreme Court sidestepped a century of federal Indian law and gave states jurisdiction to prosecute crimes on tribal lands when the perpetrator was non-Native and the victim was Native. The connections Nagle makes span generations and offer insight into our current political turmoil, at a time when a second Trump administration is testing the limits of executive authority and the law.</p> <p>In a conversation with <em>High Country News</em>, Nagle discusses how the U.S. still wields its power of empire, what impact the Trump administration could have on tribal sovereignty, and the enduring weight of history.</p> <p><em>This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p> <p><strong><em>High Country News</em></strong>: <strong>In this book, you don\u2019t just focus on the 20-year histories of these three Supreme Court cases but also tell the stories of the Muscogee and Cherokee nations before the U.S. existed. Why did you decide to take such a long view?</strong></p> <p><strong>Rebecca Nagle:</strong> One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present. I also wanted people to get a sense of how history repeats itself, and how things like a lie that tribal land is lawless get used over and over again, or the excuse that, \u201cOh, <em>this</em> is actually what\u2019s best for Native people.\u201d I wanted people to be able to see and identify those patterns.&nbsp;</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present.</p> </blockquote> <p>When I found out about the <em>McGirt</em> decision and saw the implications that my tribe\u2019s reservation would be recognized again, it was a really overwhelming emotion of relief, of joy, but there was also a lot of sadness, because I knew how much my ancestors, and Cherokee ancestors in general, had sacrificed to reach this moment. I think that a lot of other tribal citizens felt that the day that we were celebrating the Supreme Court decision. I think we all felt that weight of history.

There\u2019s a lot that we can learn from the desperation of my ancestors and their decision to sign that treaty. We can learn just how violent U.S. policy was at that time, that they would make a decision like that. There\u2019s a cultural impulse to tell stories where there are clear heroes and clear villains, and victories like <em>McGirt</em> come from a good place, and things are clean-cut.

Less than a fraction of a percent of the people staffing newsrooms are Native. Coverage of Indigenous issues very often fails to meet the standards of journalism.

But they were still repeated and cited by prominent outlets like the <em>Washington Post</em> and <em>The Wall Street Journal.</em> Oklahoma then cited those articles in their briefs, and some of that inaccurate information was actually in the (<em>Castro-Huerta</em>) Supreme Court decision.

And I think the treatment of Indigenous nations is a glaring example of that, because we\u2019ve never had any kind of constitutional amendment or reform to change those laws and to change those policies. To dispossess Indigenous people of their land, the U.S. government gave itself a lot of power over people who are not U.S. citizens. That power of empire is embedded in our Constitution, because our country wanted to take Indigenous land. We still see it manifested in deportation and shutting down asylum and separating families at the border and banning Muslims from entering our country. If we really don\u2019t want these types of policies to be enacted, there are some bigger questions about our democracy that as a society we haven\u2019t even begun to ask.</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p> If we really don\u2019t want these types of policies to be enacted, there are some bigger questions about our democracy that as a society we haven\u2019t even begun to ask.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>Given that, do you have any specific concerns about potential attacks on tribal sovereignty under a second Trump administration?</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> Everything has the capacity to get worse.

Smith, High Country NewsMarch 25, 2025<h1>Rebecca Nagle considers Supreme Court wins and what\u2019s at stake for tribes under Trump</h1> <p class=\"byline\">by Anna V. Smith, High Country News <br />March 25, 2025</p> <p class=\"has-drop-cap\">During the forced<strong> </strong>removal of Muscogee (Creek) people from their ancestral lands in the Southeastern U.S., tribal members carried the embers and ashes of their town fires with them, determined to re-establish the flames in the new communities they planned to build in what\u2019s now known as Oklahoma. Those fires still burn today in places on the Muscogee Reservation.</p> <div class=\"wp-block-group alignright\"> <!-- RTT removed image (333291) --> <p class=\"has-text-align-left\"><em><em>By the Fire We Carry</em> </em><br />By Rebecca Nagle<br />352 pages, hardcover: $30<br />Harper, 2024.</p> </p></div> <p>In <em>By the Fire We Carry</em>, Cherokee journalist Rebecca Nagle documents the interwoven stories of tribal land dispossession, forced removal, a murder in a small tribal community, her own family history and three recent and consequential Supreme Court decisions about tribal jurisdiction over lands in Oklahoma. Two of them, <em>Murphy v. Oklahoma</em> and <em>McGirt v. Oklahoma, </em>centered on crimes on land that the state of Oklahoma argued was no longer part of the Muscogee and Cherokee Nations\u2019 respective reservations. In both cases, the Supreme Court upheld the tribes\u2019 arguments in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. But shortly after came <em>Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta</em>, in which the Supreme Court sidestepped a century of federal Indian law and gave states jurisdiction to prosecute crimes on tribal lands when the perpetrator was non-Native and the victim was Native. The connections Nagle makes span generations and offer insight into our current political turmoil, at a time when a second Trump administration is testing the limits of executive authority and the law.</p> <p>In a conversation with <em>High Country News</em>, Nagle discusses how the U.S. still wields its power of empire, what impact the Trump administration could have on tribal sovereignty, and the enduring weight of history.</p> <p><em>This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p> <p><strong><em>High Country News</em></strong>: <strong>In this book, you don\u2019t just focus on the 20-year histories of these three Supreme Court cases but also tell the stories of the Muscogee and Cherokee nations before the U.S. existed. Why did you decide to take such a long view?</strong></p> <p><strong>Rebecca Nagle:</strong> One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present. I also wanted people to get a sense of how history repeats itself, and how things like a lie that tribal land is lawless get used over and over again, or the excuse that, \u201cOh, <em>this</em> is actually what\u2019s best for Native people.\u201d I wanted people to be able to see and identify those patterns.&nbsp;</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present.</p> </blockquote> <p>When I found out about the <em>McGirt</em> decision and saw the implications that my tribe\u2019s reservation would be recognized again, it was a really overwhelming emotion of relief, of joy, but there was also a lot of sadness, because I knew how much my ancestors, and Cherokee ancestors in general, had sacrificed to reach this moment. I think that a lot of other tribal citizens felt that the day that we were celebrating the Supreme Court decision. I think we all felt that weight of history. And I wanted the reader to feel that weight of history \u2014 to understand this isn\u2019t a simple story of, \u201cYay, the tribes won!\u201d There\u2019s a lot that\u2019s implicated in that victory and a lot that was lost for that rare legal victory to happen.</p> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the book you hold multiple difficult truths at once, like how George Jacobs\u2019 death \u2014 which caused so much pain for his community \u2014 was the origin of the Murphy case and also resulted in a historic win for tribal sovereignty.

And, unfortunately, the courts \u2014 dating back to before Trump \u2014 have not been reliable sources for justice for tribes. Even when the law is clearly on the tribe\u2019s side, courts have a very bad habit of bending and breaking the rules to satisfy the state or non-Native residents. One of the things that\u2019s really shocked me is how often our government institutions ignore the law when it comes to tribes and how hard tribes have to fight for just the law to be followed. Those weaknesses in our democracy have been there for a long time.We welcome reader letters. EmailHigh Country Newsateditor@hcn.orgor submit aletter to the editor.

Smith, High Country NewsMarch 25, 2025<h1>Rebecca Nagle considers Supreme Court wins and what\u2019s at stake for tribes under Trump</h1> <p class=\"byline\">by Anna V. Smith, High Country News <br />March 25, 2025</p> <p class=\"has-drop-cap\">During the forced<strong> </strong>removal of Muscogee (Creek) people from their ancestral lands in the Southeastern U.S., tribal members carried the embers and ashes of their town fires with them, determined to re-establish the flames in the new communities they planned to build in what\u2019s now known as Oklahoma. Those fires still burn today in places on the Muscogee Reservation.</p> <div class=\"wp-block-group alignright\"> <!-- RTT removed image (333291) --> <p class=\"has-text-align-left\"><em><em>By the Fire We Carry</em> </em><br />By Rebecca Nagle<br />352 pages, hardcover: $30<br />Harper, 2024.</p> </p></div> <p>In <em>By the Fire We Carry</em>, Cherokee journalist Rebecca Nagle documents the interwoven stories of tribal land dispossession, forced removal, a murder in a small tribal community, her own family history and three recent and consequential Supreme Court decisions about tribal jurisdiction over lands in Oklahoma. Two of them, <em>Murphy v. Oklahoma</em> and <em>McGirt v. Oklahoma, </em>centered on crimes on land that the state of Oklahoma argued was no longer part of the Muscogee and Cherokee Nations\u2019 respective reservations. In both cases, the Supreme Court upheld the tribes\u2019 arguments in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. But shortly after came <em>Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta</em>, in which the Supreme Court sidestepped a century of federal Indian law and gave states jurisdiction to prosecute crimes on tribal lands when the perpetrator was non-Native and the victim was Native. The connections Nagle makes span generations and offer insight into our current political turmoil, at a time when a second Trump administration is testing the limits of executive authority and the law.</p> <p>In a conversation with <em>High Country News</em>, Nagle discusses how the U.S. still wields its power of empire, what impact the Trump administration could have on tribal sovereignty, and the enduring weight of history.</p> <p><em>This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p> <p><strong><em>High Country News</em></strong>: <strong>In this book, you don\u2019t just focus on the 20-year histories of these three Supreme Court cases but also tell the stories of the Muscogee and Cherokee nations before the U.S. existed. Why did you decide to take such a long view?</strong></p> <p><strong>Rebecca Nagle:</strong> One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present. I also wanted people to get a sense of how history repeats itself, and how things like a lie that tribal land is lawless get used over and over again, or the excuse that, \u201cOh, <em>this</em> is actually what\u2019s best for Native people.\u201d I wanted people to be able to see and identify those patterns.&nbsp;</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present.</p> </blockquote> <p>When I found out about the <em>McGirt</em> decision and saw the implications that my tribe\u2019s reservation would be recognized again, it was a really overwhelming emotion of relief, of joy, but there was also a lot of sadness, because I knew how much my ancestors, and Cherokee ancestors in general, had sacrificed to reach this moment. I think that a lot of other tribal citizens felt that the day that we were celebrating the Supreme Court decision. I think we all felt that weight of history. And I wanted the reader to feel that weight of history \u2014 to understand this isn\u2019t a simple story of, \u201cYay, the tribes won!\u201d There\u2019s a lot that\u2019s implicated in that victory and a lot that was lost for that rare legal victory to happen.</p> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the book you hold multiple difficult truths at once, like how George Jacobs\u2019 death \u2014 which caused so much pain for his community \u2014 was the origin of the Murphy case and also resulted in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. Similarly, the truth of your ancestor, John Ridge, who signed a treaty that resulted in forced removal of the Cherokee people. It was against their wishes, and also what he thought he had to do to save his nation. How did you navigate that? It can be so easy to collapse these tensions to make for a simpler narrative.&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> Absolutely. As a journalist, my North Star is the truth. And I think the truth is complicated. I don\u2019t think we can tell the whole story of the <em>McGirt</em> victory without talking about the crimes and the tragedy that it originated in. And I think the same is true for my ancestors. I was sort of raised to think one thing, but I went back through the historical records and really tried to look at it for what it was. There\u2019s a lot that we can learn from the desperation of my ancestors and their decision to sign that treaty. We can learn just how violent U.S. policy was at that time, that they would make a decision like that. There\u2019s a cultural impulse to tell stories where there are clear heroes and clear villains, and victories like <em>McGirt</em> come from a good place, and things are clean-cut. I think that history is actually quite messy. I wanted a book that reflected that reality.</p> <!-- RTT removed image (333265) --> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the aftermath of the McGirt decision, the state of Oklahoma pushed a narrative of chaos and disruption in the criminal justice system, which some national outlets then repeated without much discernment.

Less than a fraction of a percent of the people staffing newsrooms are Native. Coverage of Indigenous issues very often fails to meet the standards of journalism.

And I think the treatment of Indigenous nations is a glaring example of that, because we\u2019ve never had any kind of constitutional amendment or reform to change those laws and to change those policies. To dispossess Indigenous people of their land, the U.S. government gave itself a lot of power over people who are not U.S. citizens. That power of empire is embedded in our Constitution, because our country wanted to take Indigenous land. We still see it manifested in deportation and shutting down asylum and separating families at the border and banning Muslims from entering our country.

Two of them, <em>Murphy v. Oklahoma</em> and <em>McGirt v. Oklahoma, </em>centered on crimes on land that the state of Oklahoma argued was no longer part of the Muscogee and Cherokee Nations\u2019 respective reservations. In both cases, the Supreme Court upheld the tribes\u2019 arguments in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. But shortly after came <em>Oklahoma v.

Smith, High Country NewsMarch 25, 2025<h1>Rebecca Nagle considers Supreme Court wins and what\u2019s at stake for tribes under Trump</h1> <p class=\"byline\">by Anna V. Smith, High Country News <br />March 25, 2025</p> <p class=\"has-drop-cap\">During the forced<strong> </strong>removal of Muscogee (Creek) people from their ancestral lands in the Southeastern U.S., tribal members carried the embers and ashes of their town fires with them, determined to re-establish the flames in the new communities they planned to build in what\u2019s now known as Oklahoma. Those fires still burn today in places on the Muscogee Reservation.</p> <div class=\"wp-block-group alignright\"> <!-- RTT removed image (333291) --> <p class=\"has-text-align-left\"><em><em>By the Fire We Carry</em> </em><br />By Rebecca Nagle<br />352 pages, hardcover: $30<br />Harper, 2024.</p> </p></div> <p>In <em>By the Fire We Carry</em>, Cherokee journalist Rebecca Nagle documents the interwoven stories of tribal land dispossession, forced removal, a murder in a small tribal community, her own family history and three recent and consequential Supreme Court decisions about tribal jurisdiction over lands in Oklahoma. Two of them, <em>Murphy v. Oklahoma</em> and <em>McGirt v. Oklahoma, </em>centered on crimes on land that the state of Oklahoma argued was no longer part of the Muscogee and Cherokee Nations\u2019 respective reservations. In both cases, the Supreme Court upheld the tribes\u2019 arguments in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. But shortly after came <em>Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta</em>, in which the Supreme Court sidestepped a century of federal Indian law and gave states jurisdiction to prosecute crimes on tribal lands when the perpetrator was non-Native and the victim was Native. The connections Nagle makes span generations and offer insight into our current political turmoil, at a time when a second Trump administration is testing the limits of executive authority and the law.</p> <p>In a conversation with <em>High Country News</em>, Nagle discusses how the U.S. still wields its power of empire, what impact the Trump administration could have on tribal sovereignty, and the enduring weight of history.</p> <p><em>This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p> <p><strong><em>High Country News</em></strong>: <strong>In this book, you don\u2019t just focus on the 20-year histories of these three Supreme Court cases but also tell the stories of the Muscogee and Cherokee nations before the U.S. existed. Why did you decide to take such a long view?</strong></p> <p><strong>Rebecca Nagle:</strong> One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present. I also wanted people to get a sense of how history repeats itself, and how things like a lie that tribal land is lawless get used over and over again, or the excuse that, \u201cOh, <em>this</em> is actually what\u2019s best for Native people.\u201d I wanted people to be able to see and identify those patterns.&nbsp;</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present.</p> </blockquote> <p>When I found out about the <em>McGirt</em> decision and saw the implications that my tribe\u2019s reservation would be recognized again, it was a really overwhelming emotion of relief, of joy, but there was also a lot of sadness, because I knew how much my ancestors, and Cherokee ancestors in general, had sacrificed to reach this moment. I think that a lot of other tribal citizens felt that the day that we were celebrating the Supreme Court decision. I think we all felt that weight of history. And I wanted the reader to feel that weight of history \u2014 to understand this isn\u2019t a simple story of, \u201cYay, the tribes won!\u201d There\u2019s a lot that\u2019s implicated in that victory and a lot that was lost for that rare legal victory to happen.</p> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the book you hold multiple difficult truths at once, like how George Jacobs\u2019 death \u2014 which caused so much pain for his community \u2014 was the origin of the Murphy case and also resulted in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. Similarly, the truth of your ancestor, John Ridge, who signed a treaty that resulted in forced removal of the Cherokee people. It was against their wishes, and also what he thought he had to do to save his nation. How did you navigate that? It can be so easy to collapse these tensions to make for a simpler narrative.&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> Absolutely. As a journalist, my North Star is the truth. And I think the truth is complicated. I don\u2019t think we can tell the whole story of the <em>McGirt</em> victory without talking about the crimes and the tragedy that it originated in. And I think the same is true for my ancestors. I was sort of raised to think one thing, but I went back through the historical records and really tried to look at it for what it was. There\u2019s a lot that we can learn from the desperation of my ancestors and their decision to sign that treaty. We can learn just how violent U.S. policy was at that time, that they would make a decision like that. There\u2019s a cultural impulse to tell stories where there are clear heroes and clear villains, and victories like <em>McGirt</em> come from a good place, and things are clean-cut. I think that history is actually quite messy. I wanted a book that reflected that reality.</p> <!-- RTT removed image (333265) --> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the aftermath of the McGirt decision, the state of Oklahoma pushed a narrative of chaos and disruption in the criminal justice system, which some national outlets then repeated without much discernment.

The connections Nagle makes span generations and offer insight into our current political turmoil, at a time when a second Trump administration is testing the limits of executive authority and the law.</p> <p>In a conversation with <em>High Country News</em>, Nagle discusses how the U.S. still wields its power of empire, what impact the Trump administration could have on tribal sovereignty, and the enduring weight of history.</p> <p><em>This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p> <p><strong><em>High Country News</em></strong>: <strong>In this book, you don\u2019t just focus on the 20-year histories of these three Supreme Court cases but also tell the stories of the Muscogee and Cherokee nations before the U.S. existed. Why did you decide to take such a long view?</strong></p> <p><strong>Rebecca Nagle:</strong> One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present. I also wanted people to get a sense of how history repeats itself, and how things like a lie that tribal land is lawless get used over and over again, or the excuse that, \u201cOh, <em>this</em> is actually what\u2019s best for Native people.\u201d I wanted people to be able to see and identify those patterns.&nbsp;</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present.</p> </blockquote> <p>When I found out about the <em>McGirt</em> decision and saw the implications that my tribe\u2019s reservation would be recognized again, it was a really overwhelming emotion of relief, of joy, but there was also a lot of sadness, because I knew how much my ancestors, and Cherokee ancestors in general, had sacrificed to reach this moment. I think that a lot of other tribal citizens felt that the day that we were celebrating the Supreme Court decision. I think we all felt that weight of history. And I wanted the reader to feel that weight of history \u2014 to understand this isn\u2019t a simple story of, \u201cYay, the tribes won!\u201d There\u2019s a lot that\u2019s implicated in that victory and a lot that was lost for that rare legal victory to happen.</p> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the book you hold multiple difficult truths at once, like how George Jacobs\u2019 death \u2014 which caused so much pain for his community \u2014 was the origin of the Murphy case and also resulted in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. Similarly, the truth of your ancestor, John Ridge, who signed a treaty that resulted in forced removal of the Cherokee people. It was against their wishes, and also what he thought he had to do to save his nation. How did you navigate that? It can be so easy to collapse these tensions to make for a simpler narrative.&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> Absolutely. As a journalist, my North Star is the truth. And I think the truth is complicated. I don\u2019t think we can tell the whole story of the <em>McGirt</em> victory without talking about the crimes and the tragedy that it originated in. And I think the same is true for my ancestors. I was sort of raised to think one thing, but I went back through the historical records and really tried to look at it for what it was. There\u2019s a lot that we can learn from the desperation of my ancestors and their decision to sign that treaty. We can learn just how violent U.S. policy was at that time, that they would make a decision like that. There\u2019s a cultural impulse to tell stories where there are clear heroes and clear villains, and victories like <em>McGirt</em> come from a good place, and things are clean-cut. I think that history is actually quite messy. I wanted a book that reflected that reality.</p> <!-- RTT removed image (333265) --> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the aftermath of the McGirt decision, the state of Oklahoma pushed a narrative of chaos and disruption in the criminal justice system, which some national outlets then repeated without much discernment. Can you talk about the role of the media \u2014 including the lack of Indigenous representation in newsrooms \u2014 and how that shapes the public\u2019s understanding of things like tribal sovereignty?</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> I think that it\u2019s a really big hindrance to our rights as Indigenous nations and to our sovereignty. Less than a fraction of a percent of the people staffing newsrooms are Native. Coverage of Indigenous issues very often fails to meet the standards of journalism. It doesn\u2019t have context, or a depth of knowledge of what\u2019s going on. They send reporters who\u2019ve never been on a reservation to do reporting about criminal justice on tribal land. It creates an environment where you can tell lies about tribes, and people will think that it\u2019s true.</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> </blockquote> <p>And unfortunately, that\u2019s what happened. In the wake of <em>McGirt</em>, (Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, R) made some very bold and outlandish claims about the number of criminal cases that could be prosecuted moving forward. I did some digging around with a fellow reporter, Allison Herrera, and Oklahoma\u2019s claims fell apart completely. But they were still repeated and cited by prominent outlets like the <em>Washington Post</em> and <em>The Wall Street Journal.</em> Oklahoma then cited those articles in their briefs, and some of that inaccurate information was actually in the (<em>Castro-Huerta</em>) Supreme Court decision. And so it was this tornado of disinformation that made it all the way up to the Supreme Court. Normally, we think that the <em>Washington Post</em> is a check on bad information, but not when it comes to tribes, which should be an embarrassment for them.</p> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>We\u2019re in a moment of major law and policy change under a new administration.

And I think the treatment of Indigenous nations is a glaring example of that, because we\u2019ve never had any kind of constitutional amendment or reform to change those laws and to change those policies. To dispossess Indigenous people of their land, the U.S. government gave itself a lot of power over people who are not U.S. citizens. That power of empire is embedded in our Constitution, because our country wanted to take Indigenous land.

Smith, High Country NewsMarch 25, 2025<h1>Rebecca Nagle considers Supreme Court wins and what\u2019s at stake for tribes under Trump</h1> <p class=\"byline\">by Anna V. Smith, High Country News <br />March 25, 2025</p> <p class=\"has-drop-cap\">During the forced<strong> </strong>removal of Muscogee (Creek) people from their ancestral lands in the Southeastern U.S., tribal members carried the embers and ashes of their town fires with them, determined to re-establish the flames in the new communities they planned to build in what\u2019s now known as Oklahoma. Those fires still burn today in places on the Muscogee Reservation.</p> <div class=\"wp-block-group alignright\"> <!-- RTT removed image (333291) --> <p class=\"has-text-align-left\"><em><em>By the Fire We Carry</em> </em><br />By Rebecca Nagle<br />352 pages, hardcover: $30<br />Harper, 2024.</p> </p></div> <p>In <em>By the Fire We Carry</em>, Cherokee journalist Rebecca Nagle documents the interwoven stories of tribal land dispossession, forced removal, a murder in a small tribal community, her own family history and three recent and consequential Supreme Court decisions about tribal jurisdiction over lands in Oklahoma. Two of them, <em>Murphy v. Oklahoma</em> and <em>McGirt v. Oklahoma, </em>centered on crimes on land that the state of Oklahoma argued was no longer part of the Muscogee and Cherokee Nations\u2019 respective reservations. In both cases, the Supreme Court upheld the tribes\u2019 arguments in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. But shortly after came <em>Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta</em>, in which the Supreme Court sidestepped a century of federal Indian law and gave states jurisdiction to prosecute crimes on tribal lands when the perpetrator was non-Native and the victim was Native.

Smith, High Country NewsMarch 25, 2025<h1>Rebecca Nagle considers Supreme Court wins and what\u2019s at stake for tribes under Trump</h1> <p class=\"byline\">by Anna V. Smith, High Country News <br />March 25, 2025</p> <p class=\"has-drop-cap\">During the forced<strong> </strong>removal of Muscogee (Creek) people from their ancestral lands in the Southeastern U.S., tribal members carried the embers and ashes of their town fires with them, determined to re-establish the flames in the new communities they planned to build in what\u2019s now known as Oklahoma. Those fires still burn today in places on the Muscogee Reservation.</p> <div class=\"wp-block-group alignright\"> <!-- RTT removed image (333291) --> <p class=\"has-text-align-left\"><em><em>By the Fire We Carry</em> </em><br />By Rebecca Nagle<br />352 pages, hardcover: $30<br />Harper, 2024.</p> </p></div> <p>In <em>By the Fire We Carry</em>, Cherokee journalist Rebecca Nagle documents the interwoven stories of tribal land dispossession, forced removal, a murder in a small tribal community, her own family history and three recent and consequential Supreme Court decisions about tribal jurisdiction over lands in Oklahoma. Two of them, <em>Murphy v. Oklahoma</em> and <em>McGirt v. Oklahoma, </em>centered on crimes on land that the state of Oklahoma argued was no longer part of the Muscogee and Cherokee Nations\u2019 respective reservations. In both cases, the Supreme Court upheld the tribes\u2019 arguments in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. But shortly after came <em>Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta</em>, in which the Supreme Court sidestepped a century of federal Indian law and gave states jurisdiction to prosecute crimes on tribal lands when the perpetrator was non-Native and the victim was Native. The connections Nagle makes span generations and offer insight into our current political turmoil, at a time when a second Trump administration is testing the limits of executive authority and the law.</p> <p>In a conversation with <em>High Country News</em>, Nagle discusses how the U.S. still wields its power of empire, what impact the Trump administration could have on tribal sovereignty, and the enduring weight of history.</p> <p><em>This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p> <p><strong><em>High Country News</em></strong>: <strong>In this book, you don\u2019t just focus on the 20-year histories of these three Supreme Court cases but also tell the stories of the Muscogee and Cherokee nations before the U.S. existed. Why did you decide to take such a long view?</strong></p> <p><strong>Rebecca Nagle:</strong> One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present. I also wanted people to get a sense of how history repeats itself, and how things like a lie that tribal land is lawless get used over and over again, or the excuse that, \u201cOh, <em>this</em> is actually what\u2019s best for Native people.\u201d I wanted people to be able to see and identify those patterns.&nbsp;</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present.</p> </blockquote> <p>When I found out about the <em>McGirt</em> decision and saw the implications that my tribe\u2019s reservation would be recognized again, it was a really overwhelming emotion of relief, of joy, but there was also a lot of sadness, because I knew how much my ancestors, and Cherokee ancestors in general, had sacrificed to reach this moment. I think that a lot of other tribal citizens felt that the day that we were celebrating the Supreme Court decision. I think we all felt that weight of history. And I wanted the reader to feel that weight of history \u2014 to understand this isn\u2019t a simple story of, \u201cYay, the tribes won!\u201d There\u2019s a lot that\u2019s implicated in that victory and a lot that was lost for that rare legal victory to happen.</p> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the book you hold multiple difficult truths at once, like how George Jacobs\u2019 death \u2014 which caused so much pain for his community \u2014 was the origin of the Murphy case and also resulted in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. Similarly, the truth of your ancestor, John Ridge, who signed a treaty that resulted in forced removal of the Cherokee people. It was against their wishes, and also what he thought he had to do to save his nation. How did you navigate that? It can be so easy to collapse these tensions to make for a simpler narrative.&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> Absolutely. As a journalist, my North Star is the truth. And I think the truth is complicated. I don\u2019t think we can tell the whole story of the <em>McGirt</em> victory without talking about the crimes and the tragedy that it originated in. And I think the same is true for my ancestors. I was sort of raised to think one thing, but I went back through the historical records and really tried to look at it for what it was. There\u2019s a lot that we can learn from the desperation of my ancestors and their decision to sign that treaty. We can learn just how violent U.S. policy was at that time, that they would make a decision like that. There\u2019s a cultural impulse to tell stories where there are clear heroes and clear villains, and victories like <em>McGirt</em> come from a good place, and things are clean-cut. I think that history is actually quite messy. I wanted a book that reflected that reality.</p> <!-- RTT removed image (333265) --> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the aftermath of the McGirt decision, the state of Oklahoma pushed a narrative of chaos and disruption in the criminal justice system, which some national outlets then repeated without much discernment. Can you talk about the role of the media \u2014 including the lack of Indigenous representation in newsrooms \u2014 and how that shapes the public\u2019s understanding of things like tribal sovereignty?</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> I think that it\u2019s a really big hindrance to our rights as Indigenous nations and to our sovereignty. Less than a fraction of a percent of the people staffing newsrooms are Native. Coverage of Indigenous issues very often fails to meet the standards of journalism. It doesn\u2019t have context, or a depth of knowledge of what\u2019s going on. They send reporters who\u2019ve never been on a reservation to do reporting about criminal justice on tribal land. It creates an environment where you can tell lies about tribes, and people will think that it\u2019s true.</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> </blockquote> <p>And unfortunately, that\u2019s what happened. In the wake of <em>McGirt</em>, (Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, R) made some very bold and outlandish claims about the number of criminal cases that could be prosecuted moving forward. I did some digging around with a fellow reporter, Allison Herrera, and Oklahoma\u2019s claims fell apart completely. But they were still repeated and cited by prominent outlets like the <em>Washington Post</em> and <em>The Wall Street Journal.</em> Oklahoma then cited those articles in their briefs, and some of that inaccurate information was actually in the (<em>Castro-Huerta</em>) Supreme Court decision. And so it was this tornado of disinformation that made it all the way up to the Supreme Court. Normally, we think that the <em>Washington Post</em> is a check on bad information, but not when it comes to tribes, which should be an embarrassment for them.</p> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>We\u2019re in a moment of major law and policy change under a new administration. What are some lessons from your reporting that apply to our current moment?</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> We talk about it as a problem that originates with Trump, instead of a problem that originates with some of the flaws in our democracy. And I think the treatment of Indigenous nations is a glaring example of that, because we\u2019ve never had any kind of constitutional amendment or reform to change those laws and to change those policies. To dispossess Indigenous people of their land, the U.S. government gave itself a lot of power over people who are not U.S. citizens. That power of empire is embedded in our Constitution, because our country wanted to take Indigenous land. We still see it manifested in deportation and shutting down asylum and separating families at the border and banning Muslims from entering our country. If we really don\u2019t want these types of policies to be enacted, there are some bigger questions about our democracy that as a society we haven\u2019t even begun to ask.</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p> If we really don\u2019t want these types of policies to be enacted, there are some bigger questions about our democracy that as a society we haven\u2019t even begun to ask.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>Given that, do you have any specific concerns about potential attacks on tribal sovereignty under a second Trump administration?</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> Everything has the capacity to get worse. A lot of tribal programs, whether it\u2019s (the Indian Health Service) or tribal courts, tribal law enforcement, rely on federal dollars. There\u2019s a lot specifically at stake for tribes under Trump. The remaking of the federal judiciary has a profound impact on tribes, because our cases are federal; they don\u2019t go through state court. And, unfortunately, the courts \u2014 dating back to before Trump \u2014 have not been reliable sources for justice for tribes. Even when the law is clearly on the tribe\u2019s side, courts have a very bad habit of bending and breaking the rules to satisfy the state or non-Native residents. One of the things that\u2019s really shocked me is how often our government institutions ignore the law when it comes to tribes and how hard tribes have to fight for just the law to be followed.

Smith, High Country NewsMarch 25, 2025<h1>Rebecca Nagle considers Supreme Court wins and what\u2019s at stake for tribes under Trump</h1> <p class=\"byline\">by Anna V. Smith, High Country News <br />March 25, 2025</p> <p class=\"has-drop-cap\">During the forced<strong> </strong>removal of Muscogee (Creek) people from their ancestral lands in the Southeastern U.S., tribal members carried the embers and ashes of their town fires with them, determined to re-establish the flames in the new communities they planned to build in what\u2019s now known as Oklahoma. Those fires still burn today in places on the Muscogee Reservation.</p> <div class=\"wp-block-group alignright\"> <!-- RTT removed image (333291) --> <p class=\"has-text-align-left\"><em><em>By the Fire We Carry</em> </em><br />By Rebecca Nagle<br />352 pages, hardcover: $30<br />Harper, 2024.</p> </p></div> <p>In <em>By the Fire We Carry</em>, Cherokee journalist Rebecca Nagle documents the interwoven stories of tribal land dispossession, forced removal, a murder in a small tribal community, her own family history and three recent and consequential Supreme Court decisions about tribal jurisdiction over lands in Oklahoma. Two of them, <em>Murphy v. Oklahoma</em> and <em>McGirt v. Oklahoma, </em>centered on crimes on land that the state of Oklahoma argued was no longer part of the Muscogee and Cherokee Nations\u2019 respective reservations. In both cases, the Supreme Court upheld the tribes\u2019 arguments in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. But shortly after came <em>Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta</em>, in which the Supreme Court sidestepped a century of federal Indian law and gave states jurisdiction to prosecute crimes on tribal lands when the perpetrator was non-Native and the victim was Native. The connections Nagle makes span generations and offer insight into our current political turmoil, at a time when a second Trump administration is testing the limits of executive authority and the law.</p> <p>In a conversation with <em>High Country News</em>, Nagle discusses how the U.S. still wields its power of empire, what impact the Trump administration could have on tribal sovereignty, and the enduring weight of history.</p> <p><em>This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p> <p><strong><em>High Country News</em></strong>: <strong>In this book, you don\u2019t just focus on the 20-year histories of these three Supreme Court cases but also tell the stories of the Muscogee and Cherokee nations before the U.S. existed. Why did you decide to take such a long view?</strong></p> <p><strong>Rebecca Nagle:</strong> One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present. I also wanted people to get a sense of how history repeats itself, and how things like a lie that tribal land is lawless get used over and over again, or the excuse that, \u201cOh, <em>this</em> is actually what\u2019s best for Native people.\u201d I wanted people to be able to see and identify those patterns.&nbsp;</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present.</p> </blockquote> <p>When I found out about the <em>McGirt</em> decision and saw the implications that my tribe\u2019s reservation would be recognized again, it was a really overwhelming emotion of relief, of joy, but there was also a lot of sadness, because I knew how much my ancestors, and Cherokee ancestors in general, had sacrificed to reach this moment. I think that a lot of other tribal citizens felt that the day that we were celebrating the Supreme Court decision. I think we all felt that weight of history. And I wanted the reader to feel that weight of history \u2014 to understand this isn\u2019t a simple story of, \u201cYay, the tribes won!\u201d There\u2019s a lot that\u2019s implicated in that victory and a lot that was lost for that rare legal victory to happen.</p> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the book you hold multiple difficult truths at once, like how George Jacobs\u2019 death \u2014 which caused so much pain for his community \u2014 was the origin of the Murphy case and also resulted in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. Similarly, the truth of your ancestor, John Ridge, who signed a treaty that resulted in forced removal of the Cherokee people. It was against their wishes, and also what he thought he had to do to save his nation. How did you navigate that? It can be so easy to collapse these tensions to make for a simpler narrative.&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> Absolutely. As a journalist, my North Star is the truth. And I think the truth is complicated. I don\u2019t think we can tell the whole story of the <em>McGirt</em> victory without talking about the crimes and the tragedy that it originated in. And I think the same is true for my ancestors. I was sort of raised to think one thing, but I went back through the historical records and really tried to look at it for what it was. There\u2019s a lot that we can learn from the desperation of my ancestors and their decision to sign that treaty. We can learn just how violent U.S. policy was at that time, that they would make a decision like that. There\u2019s a cultural impulse to tell stories where there are clear heroes and clear villains, and victories like <em>McGirt</em> come from a good place, and things are clean-cut. I think that history is actually quite messy. I wanted a book that reflected that reality.</p> <!-- RTT removed image (333265) --> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the aftermath of the McGirt decision, the state of Oklahoma pushed a narrative of chaos and disruption in the criminal justice system, which some national outlets then repeated without much discernment. Can you talk about the role of the media \u2014 including the lack of Indigenous representation in newsrooms \u2014 and how that shapes the public\u2019s understanding of things like tribal sovereignty?</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> I think that it\u2019s a really big hindrance to our rights as Indigenous nations and to our sovereignty. Less than a fraction of a percent of the people staffing newsrooms are Native. Coverage of Indigenous issues very often fails to meet the standards of journalism. It doesn\u2019t have context, or a depth of knowledge of what\u2019s going on. They send reporters who\u2019ve never been on a reservation to do reporting about criminal justice on tribal land. It creates an environment where you can tell lies about tribes, and people will think that it\u2019s true.</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> </blockquote> <p>And unfortunately, that\u2019s what happened. In the wake of <em>McGirt</em>, (Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, R) made some very bold and outlandish claims about the number of criminal cases that could be prosecuted moving forward. I did some digging around with a fellow reporter, Allison Herrera, and Oklahoma\u2019s claims fell apart completely. But they were still repeated and cited by prominent outlets like the <em>Washington Post</em> and <em>The Wall Street Journal.</em> Oklahoma then cited those articles in their briefs, and some of that inaccurate information was actually in the (<em>Castro-Huerta</em>) Supreme Court decision. And so it was this tornado of disinformation that made it all the way up to the Supreme Court. Normally, we think that the <em>Washington Post</em> is a check on bad information, but not when it comes to tribes, which should be an embarrassment for them.</p> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>We\u2019re in a moment of major law and policy change under a new administration. What are some lessons from your reporting that apply to our current moment?</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> We talk about it as a problem that originates with Trump, instead of a problem that originates with some of the flaws in our democracy. And I think the treatment of Indigenous nations is a glaring example of that, because we\u2019ve never had any kind of constitutional amendment or reform to change those laws and to change those policies. To dispossess Indigenous people of their land, the U.S. government gave itself a lot of power over people who are not U.S. citizens. That power of empire is embedded in our Constitution, because our country wanted to take Indigenous land. We still see it manifested in deportation and shutting down asylum and separating families at the border and banning Muslims from entering our country. If we really don\u2019t want these types of policies to be enacted, there are some bigger questions about our democracy that as a society we haven\u2019t even begun to ask.</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p> If we really don\u2019t want these types of policies to be enacted, there are some bigger questions about our democracy that as a society we haven\u2019t even begun to ask.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>Given that, do you have any specific concerns about potential attacks on tribal sovereignty under a second Trump administration?</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> Everything has the capacity to get worse. A lot of tribal programs, whether it\u2019s (the Indian Health Service) or tribal courts, tribal law enforcement, rely on federal dollars. There\u2019s a lot specifically at stake for tribes under Trump. The remaking of the federal judiciary has a profound impact on tribes, because our cases are federal; they don\u2019t go through state court. And, unfortunately, the courts \u2014 dating back to before Trump \u2014 have not been reliable sources for justice for tribes. Even when the law is clearly on the tribe\u2019s side, courts have a very bad habit of bending and breaking the rules to satisfy the state or non-Native residents. One of the things that\u2019s really shocked me is how often our government institutions ignore the law when it comes to tribes and how hard tribes have to fight for just the law to be followed.

Smith, High Country NewsMarch 25, 2025 One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present. When I found out about theMcGirtdecision and saw the implications that my tribe\u2019s reservation would be recognized again, it was a really overwhelming emotion of relief, of joy, but there was also a lot of sadness, because I knew how much my ancestors, and Cherokee ancestors in general, had sacrificed to reach this moment. I think that a lot of other tribal citizens felt that the day that we were celebrating the Supreme Court decision. I think we all felt that weight of history. And I wanted the reader to feel that weight of history \u2014 to understand this isn\u2019t a simple story of, \u201cYay, the tribes won!\u201d There\u2019s a lot that\u2019s implicated in that victory and a lot that was lost for that rare legal victory to happen.HCN:In the book you hold multiple difficult truths at once, like how George Jacobs\u2019 death \u2014 which caused so much pain for his community \u2014 was the origin of the Murphy case and also resulted in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. Similarly, the truth of your ancestor, John Ridge, who signed a treaty that resulted in forced removal of the Cherokee people. It was against their wishes, and also what he thought he had to do to save his nation. How did you navigate that? It can be so easy to collapse these tensions to make for a simpler narrative.RN:Absolutely. As a journalist, my North Star is the truth. And I think the truth is complicated. I don\u2019t think we can tell the whole story of theMcGirtvictory without talking about the crimes and the tragedy that it originated in. And I think the same is true for my ancestors. I was sort of raised to think one thing, but I went back through the historical records and really tried to look at it for what it was. There\u2019s a lot that we can learn from the desperation of my ancestors and their decision to sign that treaty. We can learn just how violent U.S. policy was at that time, that they would make a decision like that. There\u2019s a cultural impulse to tell stories where there are clear heroes and clear villains, and victories likeMcGirtcome from a good place, and things are clean-cut. I think that history is actually quite messy. I wanted a book that reflected that reality.Credit:Lauren CrowHCN:In the aftermath of the McGirt decision, the state of Oklahoma pushed a narrative of chaos and disruption in the criminal justice system, which some national outlets then repeated without much discernment. Can you talk about the role of the media \u2014 including the lack of Indigenous representation in newsrooms \u2014 and how that shapes the public\u2019s understanding of things like tribal sovereignty?RN:I think that it\u2019s a really big hindrance to our rights as Indigenous nations and to our sovereignty. Less than a fraction of a percent of the people staffing newsrooms are Native. Coverage of Indigenous issues very often fails to meet the standards of journalism. It doesn\u2019t have context, or a depth of knowledge of what\u2019s going on. They send reporters who\u2019ve never been on a reservation to do reporting about criminal justice on tribal land. It creates an environment where you can tell lies about tribes, and people will think that it\u2019s true.And unfortunately, that\u2019s what happened. In the wake ofMcGirt, (Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, R) made some very bold and outlandish claims about the number of criminal cases that could be prosecuted moving forward. I did some digging around with a fellow reporter, Allison Herrera, and Oklahoma\u2019s claims fell apart completely. But they were still repeated and cited by prominent outlets like theWashington PostandThe Wall Street Journal.Oklahoma then cited those articles in their briefs, and some of that inaccurate information was actually in the (Castro-Huerta) Supreme Court decision. And so it was this tornado of disinformation that made it all the way up to the Supreme Court. Normally, we think that theWashington Postis a check on bad information, but not when it comes to tribes, which should be an embarrassment for them.HCN:We\u2019re in a moment of major law and policy change under a new administration.

And I think the treatment of Indigenous nations is a glaring example of that, because we\u2019ve never had any kind of constitutional amendment or reform to change those laws and to change those policies. To dispossess Indigenous people of their land, the U.S. government gave itself a lot of power over people who are not U.S. citizens. That power of empire is embedded in our Constitution, because our country wanted to take Indigenous land. We still see it manifested in deportation and shutting down asylum and separating families at the border and banning Muslims from entering our country.

A lot of tribal programs, whether it\u2019s (the Indian Health Service) or tribal courts, tribal law enforcement, rely on federal dollars. There\u2019s a lot specifically at stake for tribes under Trump. The remaking of the federal judiciary has a profound impact on tribes, because our cases are federal; they don\u2019t go through state court. And, unfortunately, the courts \u2014 dating back to before Trump \u2014 have not been reliable sources for justice for tribes. Even when the law is clearly on the tribe\u2019s side, courts have a very bad habit of bending and breaking the rules to satisfy the state or non-Native residents. One of the things that\u2019s really shocked me is how often our government institutions ignore the law when it comes to tribes and how hard tribes have to fight for just the law to be followed.

Smith, High Country NewsMarch 25, 2025<h1>Rebecca Nagle considers Supreme Court wins and what\u2019s at stake for tribes under Trump</h1> <p class=\"byline\">by Anna V. Smith, High Country News <br />March 25, 2025</p> <p class=\"has-drop-cap\">During the forced<strong> </strong>removal of Muscogee (Creek) people from their ancestral lands in the Southeastern U.S., tribal members carried the embers and ashes of their town fires with them, determined to re-establish the flames in the new communities they planned to build in what\u2019s now known as Oklahoma. Those fires still burn today in places on the Muscogee Reservation.</p> <div class=\"wp-block-group alignright\"> <!-- RTT removed image (333291) --> <p class=\"has-text-align-left\"><em><em>By the Fire We Carry</em> </em><br />By Rebecca Nagle<br />352 pages, hardcover: $30<br />Harper, 2024.</p> </p></div> <p>In <em>By the Fire We Carry</em>, Cherokee journalist Rebecca Nagle documents the interwoven stories of tribal land dispossession, forced removal, a murder in a small tribal community, her own family history and three recent and consequential Supreme Court decisions about tribal jurisdiction over lands in Oklahoma. Two of them, <em>Murphy v. Oklahoma</em> and <em>McGirt v. Oklahoma, </em>centered on crimes on land that the state of Oklahoma argued was no longer part of the Muscogee and Cherokee Nations\u2019 respective reservations. In both cases, the Supreme Court upheld the tribes\u2019 arguments in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. But shortly after came <em>Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta</em>, in which the Supreme Court sidestepped a century of federal Indian law and gave states jurisdiction to prosecute crimes on tribal lands when the perpetrator was non-Native and the victim was Native. The connections Nagle makes span generations and offer insight into our current political turmoil, at a time when a second Trump administration is testing the limits of executive authority and the law.</p> <p>In a conversation with <em>High Country News</em>, Nagle discusses how the U.S. still wields its power of empire, what impact the Trump administration could have on tribal sovereignty, and the enduring weight of history.</p> <p><em>This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p> <p><strong><em>High Country News</em></strong>: <strong>In this book, you don\u2019t just focus on the 20-year histories of these three Supreme Court cases but also tell the stories of the Muscogee and Cherokee nations before the U.S. existed. Why did you decide to take such a long view?</strong></p> <p><strong>Rebecca Nagle:</strong> One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present. I also wanted people to get a sense of how history repeats itself, and how things like a lie that tribal land is lawless get used over and over again, or the excuse that, \u201cOh, <em>this</em> is actually what\u2019s best for Native people.\u201d I wanted people to be able to see and identify those patterns.&nbsp;</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present.</p> </blockquote> <p>When I found out about the <em>McGirt</em> decision and saw the implications that my tribe\u2019s reservation would be recognized again, it was a really overwhelming emotion of relief, of joy, but there was also a lot of sadness, because I knew how much my ancestors, and Cherokee ancestors in general, had sacrificed to reach this moment.

A lot of tribal programs, whether it\u2019s (the Indian Health Service) or tribal courts, tribal law enforcement, rely on federal dollars. There\u2019s a lot specifically at stake for tribes under Trump. The remaking of the federal judiciary has a profound impact on tribes, because our cases are federal; they don\u2019t go through state court. And, unfortunately, the courts \u2014 dating back to before Trump \u2014 have not been reliable sources for justice for tribes. Even when the law is clearly on the tribe\u2019s side, courts have a very bad habit of bending and breaking the rules to satisfy the state or non-Native residents. One of the things that\u2019s really shocked me is how often our government institutions ignore the law when it comes to tribes and how hard tribes have to fight for just the law to be followed.

Smith, High Country NewsMarch 25, 2025<h1>Rebecca Nagle considers Supreme Court wins and what\u2019s at stake for tribes under Trump</h1> <p class=\"byline\">by Anna V. Smith, High Country News <br />March 25, 2025</p> <p class=\"has-drop-cap\">During the forced<strong> </strong>removal of Muscogee (Creek) people from their ancestral lands in the Southeastern U.S., tribal members carried the embers and ashes of their town fires with them, determined to re-establish the flames in the new communities they planned to build in what\u2019s now known as Oklahoma. Those fires still burn today in places on the Muscogee Reservation.</p> <div class=\"wp-block-group alignright\"> <!-- RTT removed image (333291) --> <p class=\"has-text-align-left\"><em><em>By the Fire We Carry</em> </em><br />By Rebecca Nagle<br />352 pages, hardcover: $30<br />Harper, 2024.</p> </p></div> <p>In <em>By the Fire We Carry</em>, Cherokee journalist Rebecca Nagle documents the interwoven stories of tribal land dispossession, forced removal, a murder in a small tribal community, her own family history and three recent and consequential Supreme Court decisions about tribal jurisdiction over lands in Oklahoma. Two of them, <em>Murphy v. Oklahoma</em> and <em>McGirt v. Oklahoma, </em>centered on crimes on land that the state of Oklahoma argued was no longer part of the Muscogee and Cherokee Nations\u2019 respective reservations. In both cases, the Supreme Court upheld the tribes\u2019 arguments in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. But shortly after came <em>Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta</em>, in which the Supreme Court sidestepped a century of federal Indian law and gave states jurisdiction to prosecute crimes on tribal lands when the perpetrator was non-Native and the victim was Native. The connections Nagle makes span generations and offer insight into our current political turmoil, at a time when a second Trump administration is testing the limits of executive authority and the law.</p> <p>In a conversation with <em>High Country News</em>, Nagle discusses how the U.S. still wields its power of empire, what impact the Trump administration could have on tribal sovereignty, and the enduring weight of history.</p> <p><em>This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p> <p><strong><em>High Country News</em></strong>: <strong>In this book, you don\u2019t just focus on the 20-year histories of these three Supreme Court cases but also tell the stories of the Muscogee and Cherokee nations before the U.S. existed. Why did you decide to take such a long view?</strong></p> <p><strong>Rebecca Nagle:</strong> One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present. I also wanted people to get a sense of how history repeats itself, and how things like a lie that tribal land is lawless get used over and over again, or the excuse that, \u201cOh, <em>this</em> is actually what\u2019s best for Native people.\u201d I wanted people to be able to see and identify those patterns.&nbsp;</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present.</p> </blockquote> <p>When I found out about the <em>McGirt</em> decision and saw the implications that my tribe\u2019s reservation would be recognized again, it was a really overwhelming emotion of relief, of joy, but there was also a lot of sadness, because I knew how much my ancestors, and Cherokee ancestors in general, had sacrificed to reach this moment. I think that a lot of other tribal citizens felt that the day that we were celebrating the Supreme Court decision. I think we all felt that weight of history. And I wanted the reader to feel that weight of history \u2014 to understand this isn\u2019t a simple story of, \u201cYay, the tribes won!\u201d There\u2019s a lot that\u2019s implicated in that victory and a lot that was lost for that rare legal victory to happen.</p> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the book you hold multiple difficult truths at once, like how George Jacobs\u2019 death \u2014 which caused so much pain for his community \u2014 was the origin of the Murphy case and also resulted in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. Similarly, the truth of your ancestor, John Ridge, who signed a treaty that resulted in forced removal of the Cherokee people. It was against their wishes, and also what he thought he had to do to save his nation. How did you navigate that?

There\u2019s a lot that we can learn from the desperation of my ancestors and their decision to sign that treaty. We can learn just how violent U.S. policy was at that time, that they would make a decision like that. There\u2019s a cultural impulse to tell stories where there are clear heroes and clear villains, and victories like <em>McGirt</em> come from a good place, and things are clean-cut.

Smith, High Country NewsMarch 25, 2025<h1>Rebecca Nagle considers Supreme Court wins and what\u2019s at stake for tribes under Trump</h1> <p class=\"byline\">by Anna V. Smith, High Country News <br />March 25, 2025</p> <p class=\"has-drop-cap\">During the forced<strong> </strong>removal of Muscogee (Creek) people from their ancestral lands in the Southeastern U.S., tribal members carried the embers and ashes of their town fires with them, determined to re-establish the flames in the new communities they planned to build in what\u2019s now known as Oklahoma. Those fires still burn today in places on the Muscogee Reservation.</p> <div class=\"wp-block-group alignright\"> <!-- RTT removed image (333291) --> <p class=\"has-text-align-left\"><em><em>By the Fire We Carry</em> </em><br />By Rebecca Nagle<br />352 pages, hardcover: $30<br />Harper, 2024.</p> </p></div> <p>In <em>By the Fire We Carry</em>, Cherokee journalist Rebecca Nagle documents the interwoven stories of tribal land dispossession, forced removal, a murder in a small tribal community, her own family history and three recent and consequential Supreme Court decisions about tribal jurisdiction over lands in Oklahoma. Two of them, <em>Murphy v. Oklahoma</em> and <em>McGirt v. Oklahoma, </em>centered on crimes on land that the state of Oklahoma argued was no longer part of the Muscogee and Cherokee Nations\u2019 respective reservations. In both cases, the Supreme Court upheld the tribes\u2019 arguments in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. But shortly after came <em>Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta</em>, in which the Supreme Court sidestepped a century of federal Indian law and gave states jurisdiction to prosecute crimes on tribal lands when the perpetrator was non-Native and the victim was Native. The connections Nagle makes span generations and offer insight into our current political turmoil, at a time when a second Trump administration is testing the limits of executive authority and the law.</p> <p>In a conversation with <em>High Country News</em>, Nagle discusses how the U.S. still wields its power of empire, what impact the Trump administration could have on tribal sovereignty, and the enduring weight of history.</p> <p><em>This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p> <p><strong><em>High Country News</em></strong>: <strong>In this book, you don\u2019t just focus on the 20-year histories of these three Supreme Court cases but also tell the stories of the Muscogee and Cherokee nations before the U.S. existed. Why did you decide to take such a long view?</strong></p> <p><strong>Rebecca Nagle:</strong> One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present. I also wanted people to get a sense of how history repeats itself, and how things like a lie that tribal land is lawless get used over and over again, or the excuse that, \u201cOh, <em>this</em> is actually what\u2019s best for Native people.\u201d I wanted people to be able to see and identify those patterns.&nbsp;</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present.</p> </blockquote> <p>When I found out about the <em>McGirt</em> decision and saw the implications that my tribe\u2019s reservation would be recognized again, it was a really overwhelming emotion of relief, of joy, but there was also a lot of sadness, because I knew how much my ancestors, and Cherokee ancestors in general, had sacrificed to reach this moment. I think that a lot of other tribal citizens felt that the day that we were celebrating the Supreme Court decision. I think we all felt that weight of history. And I wanted the reader to feel that weight of history \u2014 to understand this isn\u2019t a simple story of, \u201cYay, the tribes won!\u201d There\u2019s a lot that\u2019s implicated in that victory and a lot that was lost for that rare legal victory to happen.</p> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the book you hold multiple difficult truths at once, like how George Jacobs\u2019 death \u2014 which caused so much pain for his community \u2014 was the origin of the Murphy case and also resulted in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. Similarly, the truth of your ancestor, John Ridge, who signed a treaty that resulted in forced removal of the Cherokee people. It was against their wishes, and also what he thought he had to do to save his nation. How did you navigate that? It can be so easy to collapse these tensions to make for a simpler narrative.&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> Absolutely. As a journalist, my North Star is the truth. And I think the truth is complicated. I don\u2019t think we can tell the whole story of the <em>McGirt</em> victory without talking about the crimes and the tragedy that it originated in. And I think the same is true for my ancestors. I was sort of raised to think one thing, but I went back through the historical records and really tried to look at it for what it was. There\u2019s a lot that we can learn from the desperation of my ancestors and their decision to sign that treaty. We can learn just how violent U.S. policy was at that time, that they would make a decision like that. There\u2019s a cultural impulse to tell stories where there are clear heroes and clear villains, and victories like <em>McGirt</em> come from a good place, and things are clean-cut. I think that history is actually quite messy. I wanted a book that reflected that reality.</p> <!-- RTT removed image (333265) --> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the aftermath of the McGirt decision, the state of Oklahoma pushed a narrative of chaos and disruption in the criminal justice system, which some national outlets then repeated without much discernment.

Smith, High Country NewsMarch 25, 2025<h1>Rebecca Nagle considers Supreme Court wins and what\u2019s at stake for tribes under Trump</h1> <p class=\"byline\">by Anna V. Smith, High Country News <br />March 25, 2025</p> <p class=\"has-drop-cap\">During the forced<strong> </strong>removal of Muscogee (Creek) people from their ancestral lands in the Southeastern U.S., tribal members carried the embers and ashes of their town fires with them, determined to re-establish the flames in the new communities they planned to build in what\u2019s now known as Oklahoma. Those fires still burn today in places on the Muscogee Reservation.</p> <div class=\"wp-block-group alignright\"> <!-- RTT removed image (333291) --> <p class=\"has-text-align-left\"><em><em>By the Fire We Carry</em> </em><br />By Rebecca Nagle<br />352 pages, hardcover: $30<br />Harper, 2024.</p> </p></div> <p>In <em>By the Fire We Carry</em>, Cherokee journalist Rebecca Nagle documents the interwoven stories of tribal land dispossession, forced removal, a murder in a small tribal community, her own family history and three recent and consequential Supreme Court decisions about tribal jurisdiction over lands in Oklahoma. Two of them, <em>Murphy v. Oklahoma</em> and <em>McGirt v. Oklahoma, </em>centered on crimes on land that the state of Oklahoma argued was no longer part of the Muscogee and Cherokee Nations\u2019 respective reservations. In both cases, the Supreme Court upheld the tribes\u2019 arguments in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. But shortly after came <em>Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta</em>, in which the Supreme Court sidestepped a century of federal Indian law and gave states jurisdiction to prosecute crimes on tribal lands when the perpetrator was non-Native and the victim was Native. The connections Nagle makes span generations and offer insight into our current political turmoil, at a time when a second Trump administration is testing the limits of executive authority and the law.</p> <p>In a conversation with <em>High Country News</em>, Nagle discusses how the U.S. still wields its power of empire, what impact the Trump administration could have on tribal sovereignty, and the enduring weight of history.</p> <p><em>This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p> <p><strong><em>High Country News</em></strong>: <strong>In this book, you don\u2019t just focus on the 20-year histories of these three Supreme Court cases but also tell the stories of the Muscogee and Cherokee nations before the U.S. existed. Why did you decide to take such a long view?</strong></p> <p><strong>Rebecca Nagle:</strong> One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present. I also wanted people to get a sense of how history repeats itself, and how things like a lie that tribal land is lawless get used over and over again, or the excuse that, \u201cOh, <em>this</em> is actually what\u2019s best for Native people.\u201d I wanted people to be able to see and identify those patterns.&nbsp;</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present.</p> </blockquote> <p>When I found out about the <em>McGirt</em> decision and saw the implications that my tribe\u2019s reservation would be recognized again, it was a really overwhelming emotion of relief, of joy, but there was also a lot of sadness, because I knew how much my ancestors, and Cherokee ancestors in general, had sacrificed to reach this moment. I think that a lot of other tribal citizens felt that the day that we were celebrating the Supreme Court decision. I think we all felt that weight of history. And I wanted the reader to feel that weight of history \u2014 to understand this isn\u2019t a simple story of, \u201cYay, the tribes won!\u201d There\u2019s a lot that\u2019s implicated in that victory and a lot that was lost for that rare legal victory to happen.</p> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the book you hold multiple difficult truths at once, like how George Jacobs\u2019 death \u2014 which caused so much pain for his community \u2014 was the origin of the Murphy case and also resulted in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. Similarly, the truth of your ancestor, John Ridge, who signed a treaty that resulted in forced removal of the Cherokee people. It was against their wishes, and also what he thought he had to do to save his nation. How did you navigate that? It can be so easy to collapse these tensions to make for a simpler narrative.&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> Absolutely. As a journalist, my North Star is the truth. And I think the truth is complicated. I don\u2019t think we can tell the whole story of the <em>McGirt</em> victory without talking about the crimes and the tragedy that it originated in. And I think the same is true for my ancestors. I was sort of raised to think one thing, but I went back through the historical records and really tried to look at it for what it was. There\u2019s a lot that we can learn from the desperation of my ancestors and their decision to sign that treaty. We can learn just how violent U.S. policy was at that time, that they would make a decision like that. There\u2019s a cultural impulse to tell stories where there are clear heroes and clear villains, and victories like <em>McGirt</em> come from a good place, and things are clean-cut. I think that history is actually quite messy. I wanted a book that reflected that reality.</p> <!-- RTT removed image (333265) --> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the aftermath of the McGirt decision, the state of Oklahoma pushed a narrative of chaos and disruption in the criminal justice system, which some national outlets then repeated without much discernment. Can you talk about the role of the media \u2014 including the lack of Indigenous representation in newsrooms \u2014 and how that shapes the public\u2019s understanding of things like tribal sovereignty?</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> I think that it\u2019s a really big hindrance to our rights as Indigenous nations and to our sovereignty. Less than a fraction of a percent of the people staffing newsrooms are Native. Coverage of Indigenous issues very often fails to meet the standards of journalism. It doesn\u2019t have context, or a depth of knowledge of what\u2019s going on. They send reporters who\u2019ve never been on a reservation to do reporting about criminal justice on tribal land. It creates an environment where you can tell lies about tribes, and people will think that it\u2019s true.</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> </blockquote> <p>And unfortunately, that\u2019s what happened. In the wake of <em>McGirt</em>, (Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, R) made some very bold and outlandish claims about the number of criminal cases that could be prosecuted moving forward. I did some digging around with a fellow reporter, Allison Herrera, and Oklahoma\u2019s claims fell apart completely. But they were still repeated and cited by prominent outlets like the <em>Washington Post</em> and <em>The Wall Street Journal.</em> Oklahoma then cited those articles in their briefs, and some of that inaccurate information was actually in the (<em>Castro-Huerta</em>) Supreme Court decision. And so it was this tornado of disinformation that made it all the way up to the Supreme Court. Normally, we think that the <em>Washington Post</em> is a check on bad information, but not when it comes to tribes, which should be an embarrassment for them.</p> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>We\u2019re in a moment of major law and policy change under a new administration. What are some lessons from your reporting that apply to our current moment?</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> We talk about it as a problem that originates with Trump, instead of a problem that originates with some of the flaws in our democracy. And I think the treatment of Indigenous nations is a glaring example of that, because we\u2019ve never had any kind of constitutional amendment or reform to change those laws and to change those policies. To dispossess Indigenous people of their land, the U.S. government gave itself a lot of power over people who are not U.S. citizens. That power of empire is embedded in our Constitution, because our country wanted to take Indigenous land. We still see it manifested in deportation and shutting down asylum and separating families at the border and banning Muslims from entering our country. If we really don\u2019t want these types of policies to be enacted, there are some bigger questions about our democracy that as a society we haven\u2019t even begun to ask.</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p> If we really don\u2019t want these types of policies to be enacted, there are some bigger questions about our democracy that as a society we haven\u2019t even begun to ask.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>Given that, do you have any specific concerns about potential attacks on tribal sovereignty under a second Trump administration?</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> Everything has the capacity to get worse.

Even when the law is clearly on the tribe\u2019s side, courts have a very bad habit of bending and breaking the rules to satisfy the state or non-Native residents. One of the things that\u2019s really shocked me is how often our government institutions ignore the law when it comes to tribes and how hard tribes have to fight for just the law to be followed.

There\u2019s a lot specifically at stake for tribes under Trump. The remaking of the federal judiciary has a profound impact on tribes, because our cases are federal; they don\u2019t go through state court.

Smith, High Country NewsMarch 25, 2025<h1>Rebecca Nagle considers Supreme Court wins and what\u2019s at stake for tribes under Trump</h1> <p class=\"byline\">by Anna V. Smith, High Country News <br />March 25, 2025</p> <p class=\"has-drop-cap\">During the forced<strong> </strong>removal of Muscogee (Creek) people from their ancestral lands in the Southeastern U.S., tribal members carried the embers and ashes of their town fires with them, determined to re-establish the flames in the new communities they planned to build in what\u2019s now known as Oklahoma. Those fires still burn today in places on the Muscogee Reservation.</p> <div class=\"wp-block-group alignright\"> <!-- RTT removed image (333291) --> <p class=\"has-text-align-left\"><em><em>By the Fire We Carry</em> </em><br />By Rebecca Nagle<br />352 pages, hardcover: $30<br />Harper, 2024.</p> </p></div> <p>In <em>By the Fire We Carry</em>, Cherokee journalist Rebecca Nagle documents the interwoven stories of tribal land dispossession, forced removal, a murder in a small tribal community, her own family history and three recent and consequential Supreme Court decisions about tribal jurisdiction over lands in Oklahoma. Two of them, <em>Murphy v. Oklahoma</em> and <em>McGirt v. Oklahoma, </em>centered on crimes on land that the state of Oklahoma argued was no longer part of the Muscogee and Cherokee Nations\u2019 respective reservations. In both cases, the Supreme Court upheld the tribes\u2019 arguments in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. But shortly after came <em>Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta</em>, in which the Supreme Court sidestepped a century of federal Indian law and gave states jurisdiction to prosecute crimes on tribal lands when the perpetrator was non-Native and the victim was Native. The connections Nagle makes span generations and offer insight into our current political turmoil, at a time when a second Trump administration is testing the limits of executive authority and the law.</p> <p>In a conversation with <em>High Country News</em>, Nagle discusses how the U.S. still wields its power of empire, what impact the Trump administration could have on tribal sovereignty, and the enduring weight of history.</p> <p><em>This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p> <p><strong><em>High Country News</em></strong>: <strong>In this book, you don\u2019t just focus on the 20-year histories of these three Supreme Court cases but also tell the stories of the Muscogee and Cherokee nations before the U.S. existed. Why did you decide to take such a long view?</strong></p> <p><strong>Rebecca Nagle:</strong> One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present. I also wanted people to get a sense of how history repeats itself, and how things like a lie that tribal land is lawless get used over and over again, or the excuse that, \u201cOh, <em>this</em> is actually what\u2019s best for Native people.\u201d I wanted people to be able to see and identify those patterns.&nbsp;</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present.</p> </blockquote> <p>When I found out about the <em>McGirt</em> decision and saw the implications that my tribe\u2019s reservation would be recognized again, it was a really overwhelming emotion of relief, of joy, but there was also a lot of sadness, because I knew how much my ancestors, and Cherokee ancestors in general, had sacrificed to reach this moment. I think that a lot of other tribal citizens felt that the day that we were celebrating the Supreme Court decision. I think we all felt that weight of history. And I wanted the reader to feel that weight of history \u2014 to understand this isn\u2019t a simple story of, \u201cYay, the tribes won!\u201d There\u2019s a lot that\u2019s implicated in that victory and a lot that was lost for that rare legal victory to happen.</p> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the book you hold multiple difficult truths at once, like how George Jacobs\u2019 death \u2014 which caused so much pain for his community \u2014 was the origin of the Murphy case and also resulted in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. Similarly, the truth of your ancestor, John Ridge, who signed a treaty that resulted in forced removal of the Cherokee people. It was against their wishes, and also what he thought he had to do to save his nation. How did you navigate that? It can be so easy to collapse these tensions to make for a simpler narrative.&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> Absolutely. As a journalist, my North Star is the truth. And I think the truth is complicated. I don\u2019t think we can tell the whole story of the <em>McGirt</em> victory without talking about the crimes and the tragedy that it originated in. And I think the same is true for my ancestors. I was sort of raised to think one thing, but I went back through the historical records and really tried to look at it for what it was. There\u2019s a lot that we can learn from the desperation of my ancestors and their decision to sign that treaty. We can learn just how violent U.S. policy was at that time, that they would make a decision like that. There\u2019s a cultural impulse to tell stories where there are clear heroes and clear villains, and victories like <em>McGirt</em> come from a good place, and things are clean-cut. I think that history is actually quite messy. I wanted a book that reflected that reality.</p> <!-- RTT removed image (333265) --> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the aftermath of the McGirt decision, the state of Oklahoma pushed a narrative of chaos and disruption in the criminal justice system, which some national outlets then repeated without much discernment. Can you talk about the role of the media \u2014 including the lack of Indigenous representation in newsrooms \u2014 and how that shapes the public\u2019s understanding of things like tribal sovereignty?</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> I think that it\u2019s a really big hindrance to our rights as Indigenous nations and to our sovereignty. Less than a fraction of a percent of the people staffing newsrooms are Native. Coverage of Indigenous issues very often fails to meet the standards of journalism. It doesn\u2019t have context, or a depth of knowledge of what\u2019s going on. They send reporters who\u2019ve never been on a reservation to do reporting about criminal justice on tribal land. It creates an environment where you can tell lies about tribes, and people will think that it\u2019s true.</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> </blockquote> <p>And unfortunately, that\u2019s what happened. In the wake of <em>McGirt</em>, (Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, R) made some very bold and outlandish claims about the number of criminal cases that could be prosecuted moving forward. I did some digging around with a fellow reporter, Allison Herrera, and Oklahoma\u2019s claims fell apart completely. But they were still repeated and cited by prominent outlets like the <em>Washington Post</em> and <em>The Wall Street Journal.</em> Oklahoma then cited those articles in their briefs, and some of that inaccurate information was actually in the (<em>Castro-Huerta</em>) Supreme Court decision. And so it was this tornado of disinformation that made it all the way up to the Supreme Court. Normally, we think that the <em>Washington Post</em> is a check on bad information, but not when it comes to tribes, which should be an embarrassment for them.</p> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>We\u2019re in a moment of major law and policy change under a new administration.

Smith, High Country NewsMarch 25, 2025<h1>Rebecca Nagle considers Supreme Court wins and what\u2019s at stake for tribes under Trump</h1> <p class=\"byline\">by Anna V. Smith, High Country News <br />March 25, 2025</p> <p class=\"has-drop-cap\">During the forced<strong> </strong>removal of Muscogee (Creek) people from their ancestral lands in the Southeastern U.S., tribal members carried the embers and ashes of their town fires with them, determined to re-establish the flames in the new communities they planned to build in what\u2019s now known as Oklahoma. Those fires still burn today in places on the Muscogee Reservation.</p> <div class=\"wp-block-group alignright\"> <!-- RTT removed image (333291) --> <p class=\"has-text-align-left\"><em><em>By the Fire We Carry</em> </em><br />By Rebecca Nagle<br />352 pages, hardcover: $30<br />Harper, 2024.</p> </p></div> <p>In <em>By the Fire We Carry</em>, Cherokee journalist Rebecca Nagle documents the interwoven stories of tribal land dispossession, forced removal, a murder in a small tribal community, her own family history and three recent and consequential Supreme Court decisions about tribal jurisdiction over lands in Oklahoma. Two of them, <em>Murphy v. Oklahoma</em> and <em>McGirt v. Oklahoma, </em>centered on crimes on land that the state of Oklahoma argued was no longer part of the Muscogee and Cherokee Nations\u2019 respective reservations. In both cases, the Supreme Court upheld the tribes\u2019 arguments in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. But shortly after came <em>Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta</em>, in which the Supreme Court sidestepped a century of federal Indian law and gave states jurisdiction to prosecute crimes on tribal lands when the perpetrator was non-Native and the victim was Native. The connections Nagle makes span generations and offer insight into our current political turmoil, at a time when a second Trump administration is testing the limits of executive authority and the law.</p> <p>In a conversation with <em>High Country News</em>, Nagle discusses how the U.S. still wields its power of empire, what impact the Trump administration could have on tribal sovereignty, and the enduring weight of history.</p> <p><em>This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p> <p><strong><em>High Country News</em></strong>: <strong>In this book, you don\u2019t just focus on the 20-year histories of these three Supreme Court cases but also tell the stories of the Muscogee and Cherokee nations before the U.S. existed. Why did you decide to take such a long view?</strong></p> <p><strong>Rebecca Nagle:</strong> One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present. I also wanted people to get a sense of how history repeats itself, and how things like a lie that tribal land is lawless get used over and over again, or the excuse that, \u201cOh, <em>this</em> is actually what\u2019s best for Native people.\u201d I wanted people to be able to see and identify those patterns.&nbsp;</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present.</p> </blockquote> <p>When I found out about the <em>McGirt</em> decision and saw the implications that my tribe\u2019s reservation would be recognized again, it was a really overwhelming emotion of relief, of joy, but there was also a lot of sadness, because I knew how much my ancestors, and Cherokee ancestors in general, had sacrificed to reach this moment. I think that a lot of other tribal citizens felt that the day that we were celebrating the Supreme Court decision. I think we all felt that weight of history. And I wanted the reader to feel that weight of history \u2014 to understand this isn\u2019t a simple story of, \u201cYay, the tribes won!\u201d There\u2019s a lot that\u2019s implicated in that victory and a lot that was lost for that rare legal victory to happen.</p> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the book you hold multiple difficult truths at once, like how George Jacobs\u2019 death \u2014 which caused so much pain for his community \u2014 was the origin of the Murphy case and also resulted in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. Similarly, the truth of your ancestor, John Ridge, who signed a treaty that resulted in forced removal of the Cherokee people. It was against their wishes, and also what he thought he had to do to save his nation. How did you navigate that? It can be so easy to collapse these tensions to make for a simpler narrative.&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> Absolutely. As a journalist, my North Star is the truth. And I think the truth is complicated. I don\u2019t think we can tell the whole story of the <em>McGirt</em> victory without talking about the crimes and the tragedy that it originated in. And I think the same is true for my ancestors. I was sort of raised to think one thing, but I went back through the historical records and really tried to look at it for what it was. There\u2019s a lot that we can learn from the desperation of my ancestors and their decision to sign that treaty. We can learn just how violent U.S. policy was at that time, that they would make a decision like that. There\u2019s a cultural impulse to tell stories where there are clear heroes and clear villains, and victories like <em>McGirt</em> come from a good place, and things are clean-cut. I think that history is actually quite messy.

Smith, High Country NewsMarch 25, 2025<h1>Rebecca Nagle considers Supreme Court wins and what\u2019s at stake for tribes under Trump</h1> <p class=\"byline\">by Anna V. Smith, High Country News <br />March 25, 2025</p> <p class=\"has-drop-cap\">During the forced<strong> </strong>removal of Muscogee (Creek) people from their ancestral lands in the Southeastern U.S., tribal members carried the embers and ashes of their town fires with them, determined to re-establish the flames in the new communities they planned to build in what\u2019s now known as Oklahoma. Those fires still burn today in places on the Muscogee Reservation.</p> <div class=\"wp-block-group alignright\"> <!-- RTT removed image (333291) --> <p class=\"has-text-align-left\"><em><em>By the Fire We Carry</em> </em><br />By Rebecca Nagle<br />352 pages, hardcover: $30<br />Harper, 2024.</p> </p></div> <p>In <em>By the Fire We Carry</em>, Cherokee journalist Rebecca Nagle documents the interwoven stories of tribal land dispossession, forced removal, a murder in a small tribal community, her own family history and three recent and consequential Supreme Court decisions about tribal jurisdiction over lands in Oklahoma. Two of them, <em>Murphy v. Oklahoma</em> and <em>McGirt v. Oklahoma, </em>centered on crimes on land that the state of Oklahoma argued was no longer part of the Muscogee and Cherokee Nations\u2019 respective reservations. In both cases, the Supreme Court upheld the tribes\u2019 arguments in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. But shortly after came <em>Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta</em>, in which the Supreme Court sidestepped a century of federal Indian law and gave states jurisdiction to prosecute crimes on tribal lands when the perpetrator was non-Native and the victim was Native. The connections Nagle makes span generations and offer insight into our current political turmoil, at a time when a second Trump administration is testing the limits of executive authority and the law.</p> <p>In a conversation with <em>High Country News</em>, Nagle discusses how the U.S. still wields its power of empire, what impact the Trump administration could have on tribal sovereignty, and the enduring weight of history.</p> <p><em>This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p> <p><strong><em>High Country News</em></strong>: <strong>In this book, you don\u2019t just focus on the 20-year histories of these three Supreme Court cases but also tell the stories of the Muscogee and Cherokee nations before the U.S. existed. Why did you decide to take such a long view?</strong></p> <p><strong>Rebecca Nagle:</strong> One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present. I also wanted people to get a sense of how history repeats itself, and how things like a lie that tribal land is lawless get used over and over again, or the excuse that, \u201cOh, <em>this</em> is actually what\u2019s best for Native people.\u201d I wanted people to be able to see and identify those patterns.&nbsp;</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present.</p> </blockquote> <p>When I found out about the <em>McGirt</em> decision and saw the implications that my tribe\u2019s reservation would be recognized again, it was a really overwhelming emotion of relief, of joy, but there was also a lot of sadness, because I knew how much my ancestors, and Cherokee ancestors in general, had sacrificed to reach this moment. I think that a lot of other tribal citizens felt that the day that we were celebrating the Supreme Court decision. I think we all felt that weight of history. And I wanted the reader to feel that weight of history \u2014 to understand this isn\u2019t a simple story of, \u201cYay, the tribes won!\u201d There\u2019s a lot that\u2019s implicated in that victory and a lot that was lost for that rare legal victory to happen.</p> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the book you hold multiple difficult truths at once, like how George Jacobs\u2019 death \u2014 which caused so much pain for his community \u2014 was the origin of the Murphy case and also resulted in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. Similarly, the truth of your ancestor, John Ridge, who signed a treaty that resulted in forced removal of the Cherokee people. It was against their wishes, and also what he thought he had to do to save his nation. How did you navigate that? It can be so easy to collapse these tensions to make for a simpler narrative.&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> Absolutely. As a journalist, my North Star is the truth. And I think the truth is complicated. I don\u2019t think we can tell the whole story of the <em>McGirt</em> victory without talking about the crimes and the tragedy that it originated in. And I think the same is true for my ancestors. I was sort of raised to think one thing, but I went back through the historical records and really tried to look at it for what it was. There\u2019s a lot that we can learn from the desperation of my ancestors and their decision to sign that treaty. We can learn just how violent U.S. policy was at that time, that they would make a decision like that. There\u2019s a cultural impulse to tell stories where there are clear heroes and clear villains, and victories like <em>McGirt</em> come from a good place, and things are clean-cut.

Smith, High Country NewsMarch 25, 2025<h1>Rebecca Nagle considers Supreme Court wins and what\u2019s at stake for tribes under Trump</h1> <p class=\"byline\">by Anna V. Smith, High Country News <br />March 25, 2025</p> <p class=\"has-drop-cap\">During the forced<strong> </strong>removal of Muscogee (Creek) people from their ancestral lands in the Southeastern U.S., tribal members carried the embers and ashes of their town fires with them, determined to re-establish the flames in the new communities they planned to build in what\u2019s now known as Oklahoma. Those fires still burn today in places on the Muscogee Reservation.</p> <div class=\"wp-block-group alignright\"> <!-- RTT removed image (333291) --> <p class=\"has-text-align-left\"><em><em>By the Fire We Carry</em> </em><br />By Rebecca Nagle<br />352 pages, hardcover: $30<br />Harper, 2024.</p> </p></div> <p>In <em>By the Fire We Carry</em>, Cherokee journalist Rebecca Nagle documents the interwoven stories of tribal land dispossession, forced removal, a murder in a small tribal community, her own family history and three recent and consequential Supreme Court decisions about tribal jurisdiction over lands in Oklahoma. Two of them, <em>Murphy v. Oklahoma</em> and <em>McGirt v. Oklahoma, </em>centered on crimes on land that the state of Oklahoma argued was no longer part of the Muscogee and Cherokee Nations\u2019 respective reservations. In both cases, the Supreme Court upheld the tribes\u2019 arguments in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. But shortly after came <em>Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta</em>, in which the Supreme Court sidestepped a century of federal Indian law and gave states jurisdiction to prosecute crimes on tribal lands when the perpetrator was non-Native and the victim was Native. The connections Nagle makes span generations and offer insight into our current political turmoil, at a time when a second Trump administration is testing the limits of executive authority and the law.</p> <p>In a conversation with <em>High Country News</em>, Nagle discusses how the U.S. still wields its power of empire, what impact the Trump administration could have on tribal sovereignty, and the enduring weight of history.</p> <p><em>This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p> <p><strong><em>High Country News</em></strong>: <strong>In this book, you don\u2019t just focus on the 20-year histories of these three Supreme Court cases but also tell the stories of the Muscogee and Cherokee nations before the U.S. existed. Why did you decide to take such a long view?</strong></p> <p><strong>Rebecca Nagle:</strong> One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present. I also wanted people to get a sense of how history repeats itself, and how things like a lie that tribal land is lawless get used over and over again, or the excuse that, \u201cOh, <em>this</em> is actually what\u2019s best for Native people.\u201d I wanted people to be able to see and identify those patterns.&nbsp;</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present.</p> </blockquote> <p>When I found out about the <em>McGirt</em> decision and saw the implications that my tribe\u2019s reservation would be recognized again, it was a really overwhelming emotion of relief, of joy, but there was also a lot of sadness, because I knew how much my ancestors, and Cherokee ancestors in general, had sacrificed to reach this moment. I think that a lot of other tribal citizens felt that the day that we were celebrating the Supreme Court decision. I think we all felt that weight of history. And I wanted the reader to feel that weight of history \u2014 to understand this isn\u2019t a simple story of, \u201cYay, the tribes won!\u201d There\u2019s a lot that\u2019s implicated in that victory and a lot that was lost for that rare legal victory to happen.</p> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the book you hold multiple difficult truths at once, like how George Jacobs\u2019 death \u2014 which caused so much pain for his community \u2014 was the origin of the Murphy case and also resulted in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. Similarly, the truth of your ancestor, John Ridge, who signed a treaty that resulted in forced removal of the Cherokee people. It was against their wishes, and also what he thought he had to do to save his nation. How did you navigate that? It can be so easy to collapse these tensions to make for a simpler narrative.&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> Absolutely. As a journalist, my North Star is the truth. And I think the truth is complicated. I don\u2019t think we can tell the whole story of the <em>McGirt</em> victory without talking about the crimes and the tragedy that it originated in. And I think the same is true for my ancestors. I was sort of raised to think one thing, but I went back through the historical records and really tried to look at it for what it was. There\u2019s a lot that we can learn from the desperation of my ancestors and their decision to sign that treaty. We can learn just how violent U.S. policy was at that time, that they would make a decision like that. There\u2019s a cultural impulse to tell stories where there are clear heroes and clear villains, and victories like <em>McGirt</em> come from a good place, and things are clean-cut. I think that history is actually quite messy. I wanted a book that reflected that reality.</p> <!-- RTT removed image (333265) --> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the aftermath of the McGirt decision, the state of Oklahoma pushed a narrative of chaos and disruption in the criminal justice system, which some national outlets then repeated without much discernment.

The remaking of the federal judiciary has a profound impact on tribes, because our cases are federal; they don\u2019t go through state court. And, unfortunately, the courts \u2014 dating back to before Trump \u2014 have not been reliable sources for justice for tribes. Even when the law is clearly on the tribe\u2019s side, courts have a very bad habit of bending and breaking the rules to satisfy the state or non-Native residents. One of the things that\u2019s really shocked me is how often our government institutions ignore the law when it comes to tribes and how hard tribes have to fight for just the law to be followed.

Smith, High Country NewsMarch 25, 2025<h1>Rebecca Nagle considers Supreme Court wins and what\u2019s at stake for tribes under Trump</h1> <p class=\"byline\">by Anna V. Smith, High Country News <br />March 25, 2025</p> <p class=\"has-drop-cap\">During the forced<strong> </strong>removal of Muscogee (Creek) people from their ancestral lands in the Southeastern U.S., tribal members carried the embers and ashes of their town fires with them, determined to re-establish the flames in the new communities they planned to build in what\u2019s now known as Oklahoma. Those fires still burn today in places on the Muscogee Reservation.</p> <div class=\"wp-block-group alignright\"> <!-- RTT removed image (333291) --> <p class=\"has-text-align-left\"><em><em>By the Fire We Carry</em> </em><br />By Rebecca Nagle<br />352 pages, hardcover: $30<br />Harper, 2024.</p> </p></div> <p>In <em>By the Fire We Carry</em>, Cherokee journalist Rebecca Nagle documents the interwoven stories of tribal land dispossession, forced removal, a murder in a small tribal community, her own family history and three recent and consequential Supreme Court decisions about tribal jurisdiction over lands in Oklahoma. Two of them, <em>Murphy v. Oklahoma</em> and <em>McGirt v. Oklahoma, </em>centered on crimes on land that the state of Oklahoma argued was no longer part of the Muscogee and Cherokee Nations\u2019 respective reservations. In both cases, the Supreme Court upheld the tribes\u2019 arguments in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. But shortly after came <em>Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta</em>, in which the Supreme Court sidestepped a century of federal Indian law and gave states jurisdiction to prosecute crimes on tribal lands when the perpetrator was non-Native and the victim was Native. The connections Nagle makes span generations and offer insight into our current political turmoil, at a time when a second Trump administration is testing the limits of executive authority and the law.</p> <p>In a conversation with <em>High Country News</em>, Nagle discusses how the U.S. still wields its power of empire, what impact the Trump administration could have on tribal sovereignty, and the enduring weight of history.</p> <p><em>This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p> <p><strong><em>High Country News</em></strong>: <strong>In this book, you don\u2019t just focus on the 20-year histories of these three Supreme Court cases but also tell the stories of the Muscogee and Cherokee nations before the U.S. existed. Why did you decide to take such a long view?</strong></p> <p><strong>Rebecca Nagle:</strong> One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present. I also wanted people to get a sense of how history repeats itself, and how things like a lie that tribal land is lawless get used over and over again, or the excuse that, \u201cOh, <em>this</em> is actually what\u2019s best for Native people.\u201d I wanted people to be able to see and identify those patterns.&nbsp;</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present.</p> </blockquote> <p>When I found out about the <em>McGirt</em> decision and saw the implications that my tribe\u2019s reservation would be recognized again, it was a really overwhelming emotion of relief, of joy, but there was also a lot of sadness, because I knew how much my ancestors, and Cherokee ancestors in general, had sacrificed to reach this moment. I think that a lot of other tribal citizens felt that the day that we were celebrating the Supreme Court decision. I think we all felt that weight of history. And I wanted the reader to feel that weight of history \u2014 to understand this isn\u2019t a simple story of, \u201cYay, the tribes won!\u201d There\u2019s a lot that\u2019s implicated in that victory and a lot that was lost for that rare legal victory to happen.</p> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the book you hold multiple difficult truths at once, like how George Jacobs\u2019 death \u2014 which caused so much pain for his community \u2014 was the origin of the Murphy case and also resulted in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. Similarly, the truth of your ancestor, John Ridge, who signed a treaty that resulted in forced removal of the Cherokee people. It was against their wishes, and also what he thought he had to do to save his nation. How did you navigate that? It can be so easy to collapse these tensions to make for a simpler narrative.&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> Absolutely. As a journalist, my North Star is the truth. And I think the truth is complicated. I don\u2019t think we can tell the whole story of the <em>McGirt</em> victory without talking about the crimes and the tragedy that it originated in. And I think the same is true for my ancestors. I was sort of raised to think one thing, but I went back through the historical records and really tried to look at it for what it was. There\u2019s a lot that we can learn from the desperation of my ancestors and their decision to sign that treaty. We can learn just how violent U.S. policy was at that time, that they would make a decision like that. There\u2019s a cultural impulse to tell stories where there are clear heroes and clear villains, and victories like <em>McGirt</em> come from a good place, and things are clean-cut. I think that history is actually quite messy. I wanted a book that reflected that reality.</p> <!-- RTT removed image (333265) --> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the aftermath of the McGirt decision, the state of Oklahoma pushed a narrative of chaos and disruption in the criminal justice system, which some national outlets then repeated without much discernment.

The connections Nagle makes span generations and offer insight into our current political turmoil, at a time when a second Trump administration is testing the limits of executive authority and the law.</p> <p>In a conversation with <em>High Country News</em>, Nagle discusses how the U.S. still wields its power of empire, what impact the Trump administration could have on tribal sovereignty, and the enduring weight of history.</p> <p><em>This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p> <p><strong><em>High Country News</em></strong>: <strong>In this book, you don\u2019t just focus on the 20-year histories of these three Supreme Court cases but also tell the stories of the Muscogee and Cherokee nations before the U.S. existed. Why did you decide to take such a long view?</strong></p> <p><strong>Rebecca Nagle:</strong> One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present. I also wanted people to get a sense of how history repeats itself, and how things like a lie that tribal land is lawless get used over and over again, or the excuse that, \u201cOh, <em>this</em> is actually what\u2019s best for Native people.\u201d I wanted people to be able to see and identify those patterns.&nbsp;</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present.</p> </blockquote> <p>When I found out about the <em>McGirt</em> decision and saw the implications that my tribe\u2019s reservation would be recognized again, it was a really overwhelming emotion of relief, of joy, but there was also a lot of sadness, because I knew how much my ancestors, and Cherokee ancestors in general, had sacrificed to reach this moment. I think that a lot of other tribal citizens felt that the day that we were celebrating the Supreme Court decision. I think we all felt that weight of history. And I wanted the reader to feel that weight of history \u2014 to understand this isn\u2019t a simple story of, \u201cYay, the tribes won!\u201d There\u2019s a lot that\u2019s implicated in that victory and a lot that was lost for that rare legal victory to happen.</p> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the book you hold multiple difficult truths at once, like how George Jacobs\u2019 death \u2014 which caused so much pain for his community \u2014 was the origin of the Murphy case and also resulted in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. Similarly, the truth of your ancestor, John Ridge, who signed a treaty that resulted in forced removal of the Cherokee people. It was against their wishes, and also what he thought he had to do to save his nation. How did you navigate that? It can be so easy to collapse these tensions to make for a simpler narrative.&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> Absolutely. As a journalist, my North Star is the truth. And I think the truth is complicated. I don\u2019t think we can tell the whole story of the <em>McGirt</em> victory without talking about the crimes and the tragedy that it originated in. And I think the same is true for my ancestors. I was sort of raised to think one thing, but I went back through the historical records and really tried to look at it for what it was. There\u2019s a lot that we can learn from the desperation of my ancestors and their decision to sign that treaty. We can learn just how violent U.S. policy was at that time, that they would make a decision like that. There\u2019s a cultural impulse to tell stories where there are clear heroes and clear villains, and victories like <em>McGirt</em> come from a good place, and things are clean-cut. I think that history is actually quite messy. I wanted a book that reflected that reality.</p> <!-- RTT removed image (333265) --> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the aftermath of the McGirt decision, the state of Oklahoma pushed a narrative of chaos and disruption in the criminal justice system, which some national outlets then repeated without much discernment. Can you talk about the role of the media \u2014 including the lack of Indigenous representation in newsrooms \u2014 and how that shapes the public\u2019s understanding of things like tribal sovereignty?</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> I think that it\u2019s a really big hindrance to our rights as Indigenous nations and to our sovereignty. Less than a fraction of a percent of the people staffing newsrooms are Native. Coverage of Indigenous issues very often fails to meet the standards of journalism. It doesn\u2019t have context, or a depth of knowledge of what\u2019s going on. They send reporters who\u2019ve never been on a reservation to do reporting about criminal justice on tribal land. It creates an environment where you can tell lies about tribes, and people will think that it\u2019s true.</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> </blockquote> <p>And unfortunately, that\u2019s what happened. In the wake of <em>McGirt</em>, (Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, R) made some very bold and outlandish claims about the number of criminal cases that could be prosecuted moving forward. I did some digging around with a fellow reporter, Allison Herrera, and Oklahoma\u2019s claims fell apart completely. But they were still repeated and cited by prominent outlets like the <em>Washington Post</em> and <em>The Wall Street Journal.</em> Oklahoma then cited those articles in their briefs, and some of that inaccurate information was actually in the (<em>Castro-Huerta</em>) Supreme Court decision. And so it was this tornado of disinformation that made it all the way up to the Supreme Court.

And I think the treatment of Indigenous nations is a glaring example of that, because we\u2019ve never had any kind of constitutional amendment or reform to change those laws and to change those policies. To dispossess Indigenous people of their land, the U.S. government gave itself a lot of power over people who are not U.S. citizens.

Smith, High Country NewsMarch 25, 2025<h1>Rebecca Nagle considers Supreme Court wins and what\u2019s at stake for tribes under Trump</h1> <p class=\"byline\">by Anna V. Smith, High Country News <br />March 25, 2025</p> <p class=\"has-drop-cap\">During the forced<strong> </strong>removal of Muscogee (Creek) people from their ancestral lands in the Southeastern U.S., tribal members carried the embers and ashes of their town fires with them, determined to re-establish the flames in the new communities they planned to build in what\u2019s now known as Oklahoma. Those fires still burn today in places on the Muscogee Reservation.</p> <div class=\"wp-block-group alignright\"> <!-- RTT removed image (333291) --> <p class=\"has-text-align-left\"><em><em>By the Fire We Carry</em> </em><br />By Rebecca Nagle<br />352 pages, hardcover: $30<br />Harper, 2024.</p> </p></div> <p>In <em>By the Fire We Carry</em>, Cherokee journalist Rebecca Nagle documents the interwoven stories of tribal land dispossession, forced removal, a murder in a small tribal community, her own family history and three recent and consequential Supreme Court decisions about tribal jurisdiction over lands in Oklahoma. Two of them, <em>Murphy v. Oklahoma</em> and <em>McGirt v. Oklahoma, </em>centered on crimes on land that the state of Oklahoma argued was no longer part of the Muscogee and Cherokee Nations\u2019 respective reservations. In both cases, the Supreme Court upheld the tribes\u2019 arguments in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. But shortly after came <em>Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta</em>, in which the Supreme Court sidestepped a century of federal Indian law and gave states jurisdiction to prosecute crimes on tribal lands when the perpetrator was non-Native and the victim was Native.

Smith, High Country NewsMarch 25, 2025<h1>Rebecca Nagle considers Supreme Court wins and what\u2019s at stake for tribes under Trump</h1> <p class=\"byline\">by Anna V. Smith, High Country News <br />March 25, 2025</p> <p class=\"has-drop-cap\">During the forced<strong> </strong>removal of Muscogee (Creek) people from their ancestral lands in the Southeastern U.S., tribal members carried the embers and ashes of their town fires with them, determined to re-establish the flames in the new communities they planned to build in what\u2019s now known as Oklahoma. Those fires still burn today in places on the Muscogee Reservation.</p> <div class=\"wp-block-group alignright\"> <!-- RTT removed image (333291) --> <p class=\"has-text-align-left\"><em><em>By the Fire We Carry</em> </em><br />By Rebecca Nagle<br />352 pages, hardcover: $30<br />Harper, 2024.</p> </p></div> <p>In <em>By the Fire We Carry</em>, Cherokee journalist Rebecca Nagle documents the interwoven stories of tribal land dispossession, forced removal, a murder in a small tribal community, her own family history and three recent and consequential Supreme Court decisions about tribal jurisdiction over lands in Oklahoma. Two of them, <em>Murphy v. Oklahoma</em> and <em>McGirt v. Oklahoma, </em>centered on crimes on land that the state of Oklahoma argued was no longer part of the Muscogee and Cherokee Nations\u2019 respective reservations. In both cases, the Supreme Court upheld the tribes\u2019 arguments in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. But shortly after came <em>Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta</em>, in which the Supreme Court sidestepped a century of federal Indian law and gave states jurisdiction to prosecute crimes on tribal lands when the perpetrator was non-Native and the victim was Native. The connections Nagle makes span generations and offer insight into our current political turmoil, at a time when a second Trump administration is testing the limits of executive authority and the law.</p> <p>In a conversation with <em>High Country News</em>, Nagle discusses how the U.S. still wields its power of empire, what impact the Trump administration could have on tribal sovereignty, and the enduring weight of history.</p> <p><em>This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p> <p><strong><em>High Country News</em></strong>: <strong>In this book, you don\u2019t just focus on the 20-year histories of these three Supreme Court cases but also tell the stories of the Muscogee and Cherokee nations before the U.S. existed. Why did you decide to take such a long view?</strong></p> <p><strong>Rebecca Nagle:</strong> One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present. I also wanted people to get a sense of how history repeats itself, and how things like a lie that tribal land is lawless get used over and over again, or the excuse that, \u201cOh, <em>this</em> is actually what\u2019s best for Native people.\u201d I wanted people to be able to see and identify those patterns.&nbsp;</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present.</p> </blockquote> <p>When I found out about the <em>McGirt</em> decision and saw the implications that my tribe\u2019s reservation would be recognized again, it was a really overwhelming emotion of relief, of joy, but there was also a lot of sadness, because I knew how much my ancestors, and Cherokee ancestors in general, had sacrificed to reach this moment. I think that a lot of other tribal citizens felt that the day that we were celebrating the Supreme Court decision. I think we all felt that weight of history. And I wanted the reader to feel that weight of history \u2014 to understand this isn\u2019t a simple story of, \u201cYay, the tribes won!\u201d There\u2019s a lot that\u2019s implicated in that victory and a lot that was lost for that rare legal victory to happen.</p> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the book you hold multiple difficult truths at once, like how George Jacobs\u2019 death \u2014 which caused so much pain for his community \u2014 was the origin of the Murphy case and also resulted in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. Similarly, the truth of your ancestor, John Ridge, who signed a treaty that resulted in forced removal of the Cherokee people. It was against their wishes, and also what he thought he had to do to save his nation. How did you navigate that? It can be so easy to collapse these tensions to make for a simpler narrative.&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> Absolutely. As a journalist, my North Star is the truth. And I think the truth is complicated. I don\u2019t think we can tell the whole story of the <em>McGirt</em> victory without talking about the crimes and the tragedy that it originated in. And I think the same is true for my ancestors. I was sort of raised to think one thing, but I went back through the historical records and really tried to look at it for what it was. There\u2019s a lot that we can learn from the desperation of my ancestors and their decision to sign that treaty. We can learn just how violent U.S. policy was at that time, that they would make a decision like that. There\u2019s a cultural impulse to tell stories where there are clear heroes and clear villains, and victories like <em>McGirt</em> come from a good place, and things are clean-cut. I think that history is actually quite messy. I wanted a book that reflected that reality.</p> <!-- RTT removed image (333265) --> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the aftermath of the McGirt decision, the state of Oklahoma pushed a narrative of chaos and disruption in the criminal justice system, which some national outlets then repeated without much discernment. Can you talk about the role of the media \u2014 including the lack of Indigenous representation in newsrooms \u2014 and how that shapes the public\u2019s understanding of things like tribal sovereignty?</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> I think that it\u2019s a really big hindrance to our rights as Indigenous nations and to our sovereignty. Less than a fraction of a percent of the people staffing newsrooms are Native. Coverage of Indigenous issues very often fails to meet the standards of journalism. It doesn\u2019t have context, or a depth of knowledge of what\u2019s going on. They send reporters who\u2019ve never been on a reservation to do reporting about criminal justice on tribal land.

But they were still repeated and cited by prominent outlets like the <em>Washington Post</em> and <em>The Wall Street Journal.</em> Oklahoma then cited those articles in their briefs, and some of that inaccurate information was actually in the (<em>Castro-Huerta</em>) Supreme Court decision.

What are some lessons from your reporting that apply to our current moment?</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> We talk about it as a problem that originates with Trump, instead of a problem that originates with some of the flaws in our democracy. And I think the treatment of Indigenous nations is a glaring example of that, because we\u2019ve never had any kind of constitutional amendment or reform to change those laws and to change those policies. To dispossess Indigenous people of their land, the U.S. government gave itself a lot of power over people who are not U.S. citizens. That power of empire is embedded in our Constitution, because our country wanted to take Indigenous land. We still see it manifested in deportation and shutting down asylum and separating families at the border and banning Muslims from entering our country.

Smith, High Country NewsMarch 25, 2025<h1>Rebecca Nagle considers Supreme Court wins and what\u2019s at stake for tribes under Trump</h1> <p class=\"byline\">by Anna V. Smith, High Country News <br />March 25, 2025</p> <p class=\"has-drop-cap\">During the forced<strong> </strong>removal of Muscogee (Creek) people from their ancestral lands in the Southeastern U.S., tribal members carried the embers and ashes of their town fires with them, determined to re-establish the flames in the new communities they planned to build in what\u2019s now known as Oklahoma. Those fires still burn today in places on the Muscogee Reservation.</p> <div class=\"wp-block-group alignright\"> <!-- RTT removed image (333291) --> <p class=\"has-text-align-left\"><em><em>By the Fire We Carry</em> </em><br />By Rebecca Nagle<br />352 pages, hardcover: $30<br />Harper, 2024.</p> </p></div> <p>In <em>By the Fire We Carry</em>, Cherokee journalist Rebecca Nagle documents the interwoven stories of tribal land dispossession, forced removal, a murder in a small tribal community, her own family history and three recent and consequential Supreme Court decisions about tribal jurisdiction over lands in Oklahoma. Two of them, <em>Murphy v. Oklahoma</em> and <em>McGirt v. Oklahoma, </em>centered on crimes on land that the state of Oklahoma argued was no longer part of the Muscogee and Cherokee Nations\u2019 respective reservations. In both cases, the Supreme Court upheld the tribes\u2019 arguments in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. But shortly after came <em>Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta</em>, in which the Supreme Court sidestepped a century of federal Indian law and gave states jurisdiction to prosecute crimes on tribal lands when the perpetrator was non-Native and the victim was Native. The connections Nagle makes span generations and offer insight into our current political turmoil, at a time when a second Trump administration is testing the limits of executive authority and the law.</p> <p>In a conversation with <em>High Country News</em>, Nagle discusses how the U.S. still wields its power of empire, what impact the Trump administration could have on tribal sovereignty, and the enduring weight of history.</p> <p><em>This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p> <p><strong><em>High Country News</em></strong>: <strong>In this book, you don\u2019t just focus on the 20-year histories of these three Supreme Court cases but also tell the stories of the Muscogee and Cherokee nations before the U.S. existed. Why did you decide to take such a long view?</strong></p> <p><strong>Rebecca Nagle:</strong> One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present. I also wanted people to get a sense of how history repeats itself, and how things like a lie that tribal land is lawless get used over and over again, or the excuse that, \u201cOh, <em>this</em> is actually what\u2019s best for Native people.\u201d I wanted people to be able to see and identify those patterns.&nbsp;</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present.</p> </blockquote> <p>When I found out about the <em>McGirt</em> decision and saw the implications that my tribe\u2019s reservation would be recognized again, it was a really overwhelming emotion of relief, of joy, but there was also a lot of sadness, because I knew how much my ancestors, and Cherokee ancestors in general, had sacrificed to reach this moment. I think that a lot of other tribal citizens felt that the day that we were celebrating the Supreme Court decision. I think we all felt that weight of history. And I wanted the reader to feel that weight of history \u2014 to understand this isn\u2019t a simple story of, \u201cYay, the tribes won!\u201d There\u2019s a lot that\u2019s implicated in that victory and a lot that was lost for that rare legal victory to happen.</p> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the book you hold multiple difficult truths at once, like how George Jacobs\u2019 death \u2014 which caused so much pain for his community \u2014 was the origin of the Murphy case and also resulted in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. Similarly, the truth of your ancestor, John Ridge, who signed a treaty that resulted in forced removal of the Cherokee people. It was against their wishes, and also what he thought he had to do to save his nation. How did you navigate that? It can be so easy to collapse these tensions to make for a simpler narrative.&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> Absolutely. As a journalist, my North Star is the truth. And I think the truth is complicated. I don\u2019t think we can tell the whole story of the <em>McGirt</em> victory without talking about the crimes and the tragedy that it originated in. And I think the same is true for my ancestors. I was sort of raised to think one thing, but I went back through the historical records and really tried to look at it for what it was. There\u2019s a lot that we can learn from the desperation of my ancestors and their decision to sign that treaty. We can learn just how violent U.S. policy was at that time, that they would make a decision like that. There\u2019s a cultural impulse to tell stories where there are clear heroes and clear villains, and victories like <em>McGirt</em> come from a good place, and things are clean-cut. I think that history is actually quite messy. I wanted a book that reflected that reality.</p> <!-- RTT removed image (333265) --> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the aftermath of the McGirt decision, the state of Oklahoma pushed a narrative of chaos and disruption in the criminal justice system, which some national outlets then repeated without much discernment. Can you talk about the role of the media \u2014 including the lack of Indigenous representation in newsrooms \u2014 and how that shapes the public\u2019s understanding of things like tribal sovereignty?</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> I think that it\u2019s a really big hindrance to our rights as Indigenous nations and to our sovereignty. Less than a fraction of a percent of the people staffing newsrooms are Native. Coverage of Indigenous issues very often fails to meet the standards of journalism. It doesn\u2019t have context, or a depth of knowledge of what\u2019s going on. They send reporters who\u2019ve never been on a reservation to do reporting about criminal justice on tribal land. It creates an environment where you can tell lies about tribes, and people will think that it\u2019s true.</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> </blockquote> <p>And unfortunately, that\u2019s what happened. In the wake of <em>McGirt</em>, (Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, R) made some very bold and outlandish claims about the number of criminal cases that could be prosecuted moving forward. I did some digging around with a fellow reporter, Allison Herrera, and Oklahoma\u2019s claims fell apart completely. But they were still repeated and cited by prominent outlets like the <em>Washington Post</em> and <em>The Wall Street Journal.</em> Oklahoma then cited those articles in their briefs, and some of that inaccurate information was actually in the (<em>Castro-Huerta</em>) Supreme Court decision. And so it was this tornado of disinformation that made it all the way up to the Supreme Court. Normally, we think that the <em>Washington Post</em> is a check on bad information, but not when it comes to tribes, which should be an embarrassment for them.</p> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>We\u2019re in a moment of major law and policy change under a new administration. What are some lessons from your reporting that apply to our current moment?</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> We talk about it as a problem that originates with Trump, instead of a problem that originates with some of the flaws in our democracy. And I think the treatment of Indigenous nations is a glaring example of that, because we\u2019ve never had any kind of constitutional amendment or reform to change those laws and to change those policies. To dispossess Indigenous people of their land, the U.S. government gave itself a lot of power over people who are not U.S. citizens. That power of empire is embedded in our Constitution, because our country wanted to take Indigenous land. We still see it manifested in deportation and shutting down asylum and separating families at the border and banning Muslims from entering our country. If we really don\u2019t want these types of policies to be enacted, there are some bigger questions about our democracy that as a society we haven\u2019t even begun to ask.</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p> If we really don\u2019t want these types of policies to be enacted, there are some bigger questions about our democracy that as a society we haven\u2019t even begun to ask.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>Given that, do you have any specific concerns about potential attacks on tribal sovereignty under a second Trump administration?</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> Everything has the capacity to get worse.

Smith, High Country NewsMarch 25, 2025<h1>Rebecca Nagle considers Supreme Court wins and what\u2019s at stake for tribes under Trump</h1> <p class=\"byline\">by Anna V. Smith, High Country News <br />March 25, 2025</p> <p class=\"has-drop-cap\">During the forced<strong> </strong>removal of Muscogee (Creek) people from their ancestral lands in the Southeastern U.S., tribal members carried the embers and ashes of their town fires with them, determined to re-establish the flames in the new communities they planned to build in what\u2019s now known as Oklahoma. Those fires still burn today in places on the Muscogee Reservation.</p> <div class=\"wp-block-group alignright\"> <!-- RTT removed image (333291) --> <p class=\"has-text-align-left\"><em><em>By the Fire We Carry</em> </em><br />By Rebecca Nagle<br />352 pages, hardcover: $30<br />Harper, 2024.</p> </p></div> <p>In <em>By the Fire We Carry</em>, Cherokee journalist Rebecca Nagle documents the interwoven stories of tribal land dispossession, forced removal, a murder in a small tribal community, her own family history and three recent and consequential Supreme Court decisions about tribal jurisdiction over lands in Oklahoma. Two of them, <em>Murphy v. Oklahoma</em> and <em>McGirt v. Oklahoma, </em>centered on crimes on land that the state of Oklahoma argued was no longer part of the Muscogee and Cherokee Nations\u2019 respective reservations. In both cases, the Supreme Court upheld the tribes\u2019 arguments in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. But shortly after came <em>Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta</em>, in which the Supreme Court sidestepped a century of federal Indian law and gave states jurisdiction to prosecute crimes on tribal lands when the perpetrator was non-Native and the victim was Native. The connections Nagle makes span generations and offer insight into our current political turmoil, at a time when a second Trump administration is testing the limits of executive authority and the law.</p> <p>In a conversation with <em>High Country News</em>, Nagle discusses how the U.S. still wields its power of empire, what impact the Trump administration could have on tribal sovereignty, and the enduring weight of history.</p> <p><em>This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p> <p><strong><em>High Country News</em></strong>: <strong>In this book, you don\u2019t just focus on the 20-year histories of these three Supreme Court cases but also tell the stories of the Muscogee and Cherokee nations before the U.S. existed. Why did you decide to take such a long view?</strong></p> <p><strong>Rebecca Nagle:</strong> One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present. I also wanted people to get a sense of how history repeats itself, and how things like a lie that tribal land is lawless get used over and over again, or the excuse that, \u201cOh, <em>this</em> is actually what\u2019s best for Native people.\u201d I wanted people to be able to see and identify those patterns.&nbsp;</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present.</p> </blockquote> <p>When I found out about the <em>McGirt</em> decision and saw the implications that my tribe\u2019s reservation would be recognized again, it was a really overwhelming emotion of relief, of joy, but there was also a lot of sadness, because I knew how much my ancestors, and Cherokee ancestors in general, had sacrificed to reach this moment. I think that a lot of other tribal citizens felt that the day that we were celebrating the Supreme Court decision. I think we all felt that weight of history. And I wanted the reader to feel that weight of history \u2014 to understand this isn\u2019t a simple story of, \u201cYay, the tribes won!\u201d There\u2019s a lot that\u2019s implicated in that victory and a lot that was lost for that rare legal victory to happen.</p> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the book you hold multiple difficult truths at once, like how George Jacobs\u2019 death \u2014 which caused so much pain for his community \u2014 was the origin of the Murphy case and also resulted in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. Similarly, the truth of your ancestor, John Ridge, who signed a treaty that resulted in forced removal of the Cherokee people. It was against their wishes, and also what he thought he had to do to save his nation. How did you navigate that? It can be so easy to collapse these tensions to make for a simpler narrative.&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> Absolutely. As a journalist, my North Star is the truth. And I think the truth is complicated. I don\u2019t think we can tell the whole story of the <em>McGirt</em> victory without talking about the crimes and the tragedy that it originated in. And I think the same is true for my ancestors. I was sort of raised to think one thing, but I went back through the historical records and really tried to look at it for what it was. There\u2019s a lot that we can learn from the desperation of my ancestors and their decision to sign that treaty. We can learn just how violent U.S. policy was at that time, that they would make a decision like that. There\u2019s a cultural impulse to tell stories where there are clear heroes and clear villains, and victories like <em>McGirt</em> come from a good place, and things are clean-cut. I think that history is actually quite messy. I wanted a book that reflected that reality.</p> <!-- RTT removed image (333265) --> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the aftermath of the McGirt decision, the state of Oklahoma pushed a narrative of chaos and disruption in the criminal justice system, which some national outlets then repeated without much discernment. Can you talk about the role of the media \u2014 including the lack of Indigenous representation in newsrooms \u2014 and how that shapes the public\u2019s understanding of things like tribal sovereignty?</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> I think that it\u2019s a really big hindrance to our rights as Indigenous nations and to our sovereignty. Less than a fraction of a percent of the people staffing newsrooms are Native. Coverage of Indigenous issues very often fails to meet the standards of journalism. It doesn\u2019t have context, or a depth of knowledge of what\u2019s going on. They send reporters who\u2019ve never been on a reservation to do reporting about criminal justice on tribal land. It creates an environment where you can tell lies about tribes, and people will think that it\u2019s true.</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> </blockquote> <p>And unfortunately, that\u2019s what happened. In the wake of <em>McGirt</em>, (Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, R) made some very bold and outlandish claims about the number of criminal cases that could be prosecuted moving forward. I did some digging around with a fellow reporter, Allison Herrera, and Oklahoma\u2019s claims fell apart completely. But they were still repeated and cited by prominent outlets like the <em>Washington Post</em> and <em>The Wall Street Journal.</em> Oklahoma then cited those articles in their briefs, and some of that inaccurate information was actually in the (<em>Castro-Huerta</em>) Supreme Court decision. And so it was this tornado of disinformation that made it all the way up to the Supreme Court. Normally, we think that the <em>Washington Post</em> is a check on bad information, but not when it comes to tribes, which should be an embarrassment for them.</p> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>We\u2019re in a moment of major law and policy change under a new administration. What are some lessons from your reporting that apply to our current moment?</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> We talk about it as a problem that originates with Trump, instead of a problem that originates with some of the flaws in our democracy. And I think the treatment of Indigenous nations is a glaring example of that, because we\u2019ve never had any kind of constitutional amendment or reform to change those laws and to change those policies. To dispossess Indigenous people of their land, the U.S. government gave itself a lot of power over people who are not U.S. citizens. That power of empire is embedded in our Constitution, because our country wanted to take Indigenous land. We still see it manifested in deportation and shutting down asylum and separating families at the border and banning Muslims from entering our country. If we really don\u2019t want these types of policies to be enacted, there are some bigger questions about our democracy that as a society we haven\u2019t even begun to ask.</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p> If we really don\u2019t want these types of policies to be enacted, there are some bigger questions about our democracy that as a society we haven\u2019t even begun to ask.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>Given that, do you have any specific concerns about potential attacks on tribal sovereignty under a second Trump administration?</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> Everything has the capacity to get worse. A lot of tribal programs, whether it\u2019s (the Indian Health Service) or tribal courts, tribal law enforcement, rely on federal dollars. There\u2019s a lot specifically at stake for tribes under Trump.

I also wanted people to get a sense of how history repeats itself, and how things like a lie that tribal land is lawless get used over and over again, or the excuse that, \u201cOh, <em>this</em> is actually what\u2019s best for Native people.\u201d I wanted people to be able to see and identify those patterns.&nbsp;</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present.</p> </blockquote> <p>When I found out about the <em>McGirt</em> decision and saw the implications that my tribe\u2019s reservation would be recognized again, it was a really overwhelming emotion of relief, of joy, but there was also a lot of sadness, because I knew how much my ancestors, and Cherokee ancestors in general, had sacrificed to reach this moment. I think that a lot of other tribal citizens felt that the day that we were celebrating the Supreme Court decision. I think we all felt that weight of history. And I wanted the reader to feel that weight of history \u2014 to understand this isn\u2019t a simple story of, \u201cYay, the tribes won!\u201d There\u2019s a lot that\u2019s implicated in that victory and a lot that was lost for that rare legal victory to happen.</p> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the book you hold multiple difficult truths at once, like how George Jacobs\u2019 death \u2014 which caused so much pain for his community \u2014 was the origin of the Murphy case and also resulted in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. Similarly, the truth of your ancestor, John Ridge, who signed a treaty that resulted in forced removal of the Cherokee people. It was against their wishes, and also what he thought he had to do to save his nation. How did you navigate that? It can be so easy to collapse these tensions to make for a simpler narrative.&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> Absolutely. As a journalist, my North Star is the truth. And I think the truth is complicated. I don\u2019t think we can tell the whole story of the <em>McGirt</em> victory without talking about the crimes and the tragedy that it originated in. And I think the same is true for my ancestors. I was sort of raised to think one thing, but I went back through the historical records and really tried to look at it for what it was. There\u2019s a lot that we can learn from the desperation of my ancestors and their decision to sign that treaty. We can learn just how violent U.S. policy was at that time, that they would make a decision like that. There\u2019s a cultural impulse to tell stories where there are clear heroes and clear villains, and victories like <em>McGirt</em> come from a good place, and things are clean-cut. I think that history is actually quite messy. I wanted a book that reflected that reality.</p> <!-- RTT removed image (333265) --> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the aftermath of the McGirt decision, the state of Oklahoma pushed a narrative of chaos and disruption in the criminal justice system, which some national outlets then repeated without much discernment.

Smith, High Country NewsMarch 25, 2025<h1>Rebecca Nagle considers Supreme Court wins and what\u2019s at stake for tribes under Trump</h1> <p class=\"byline\">by Anna V. Smith, High Country News <br />March 25, 2025</p> <p class=\"has-drop-cap\">During the forced<strong> </strong>removal of Muscogee (Creek) people from their ancestral lands in the Southeastern U.S., tribal members carried the embers and ashes of their town fires with them, determined to re-establish the flames in the new communities they planned to build in what\u2019s now known as Oklahoma. Those fires still burn today in places on the Muscogee Reservation.</p> <div class=\"wp-block-group alignright\"> <!-- RTT removed image (333291) --> <p class=\"has-text-align-left\"><em><em>By the Fire We Carry</em> </em><br />By Rebecca Nagle<br />352 pages, hardcover: $30<br />Harper, 2024.</p> </p></div> <p>In <em>By the Fire We Carry</em>, Cherokee journalist Rebecca Nagle documents the interwoven stories of tribal land dispossession, forced removal, a murder in a small tribal community, her own family history and three recent and consequential Supreme Court decisions about tribal jurisdiction over lands in Oklahoma. Two of them, <em>Murphy v. Oklahoma</em> and <em>McGirt v. Oklahoma, </em>centered on crimes on land that the state of Oklahoma argued was no longer part of the Muscogee and Cherokee Nations\u2019 respective reservations. In both cases, the Supreme Court upheld the tribes\u2019 arguments in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. But shortly after came <em>Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta</em>, in which the Supreme Court sidestepped a century of federal Indian law and gave states jurisdiction to prosecute crimes on tribal lands when the perpetrator was non-Native and the victim was Native. The connections Nagle makes span generations and offer insight into our current political turmoil, at a time when a second Trump administration is testing the limits of executive authority and the law.</p> <p>In a conversation with <em>High Country News</em>, Nagle discusses how the U.S. still wields its power of empire, what impact the Trump administration could have on tribal sovereignty, and the enduring weight of history.</p> <p><em>This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p> <p><strong><em>High Country News</em></strong>: <strong>In this book, you don\u2019t just focus on the 20-year histories of these three Supreme Court cases but also tell the stories of the Muscogee and Cherokee nations before the U.S. existed.

Smith, High Country NewsMarch 25, 2025<h1>Rebecca Nagle considers Supreme Court wins and what\u2019s at stake for tribes under Trump</h1> <p class=\"byline\">by Anna V. Smith, High Country News <br />March 25, 2025</p> <p class=\"has-drop-cap\">During the forced<strong> </strong>removal of Muscogee (Creek) people from their ancestral lands in the Southeastern U.S., tribal members carried the embers and ashes of their town fires with them, determined to re-establish the flames in the new communities they planned to build in what\u2019s now known as Oklahoma. Those fires still burn today in places on the Muscogee Reservation.</p> <div class=\"wp-block-group alignright\"> <!-- RTT removed image (333291) --> <p class=\"has-text-align-left\"><em><em>By the Fire We Carry</em> </em><br />By Rebecca Nagle<br />352 pages, hardcover: $30<br />Harper, 2024.</p> </p></div> <p>In <em>By the Fire We Carry</em>, Cherokee journalist Rebecca Nagle documents the interwoven stories of tribal land dispossession, forced removal, a murder in a small tribal community, her own family history and three recent and consequential Supreme Court decisions about tribal jurisdiction over lands in Oklahoma. Two of them, <em>Murphy v. Oklahoma</em> and <em>McGirt v. Oklahoma, </em>centered on crimes on land that the state of Oklahoma argued was no longer part of the Muscogee and Cherokee Nations\u2019 respective reservations. In both cases, the Supreme Court upheld the tribes\u2019 arguments in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. But shortly after came <em>Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta</em>, in which the Supreme Court sidestepped a century of federal Indian law and gave states jurisdiction to prosecute crimes on tribal lands when the perpetrator was non-Native and the victim was Native. The connections Nagle makes span generations and offer insight into our current political turmoil, at a time when a second Trump administration is testing the limits of executive authority and the law.</p> <p>In a conversation with <em>High Country News</em>, Nagle discusses how the U.S. still wields its power of empire, what impact the Trump administration could have on tribal sovereignty, and the enduring weight of history.</p> <p><em>This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p> <p><strong><em>High Country News</em></strong>: <strong>In this book, you don\u2019t just focus on the 20-year histories of these three Supreme Court cases but also tell the stories of the Muscogee and Cherokee nations before the U.S. existed. Why did you decide to take such a long view?</strong></p> <p><strong>Rebecca Nagle:</strong> One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present. I also wanted people to get a sense of how history repeats itself, and how things like a lie that tribal land is lawless get used over and over again, or the excuse that, \u201cOh, <em>this</em> is actually what\u2019s best for Native people.\u201d I wanted people to be able to see and identify those patterns.&nbsp;</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present.</p> </blockquote> <p>When I found out about the <em>McGirt</em> decision and saw the implications that my tribe\u2019s reservation would be recognized again, it was a really overwhelming emotion of relief, of joy, but there was also a lot of sadness, because I knew how much my ancestors, and Cherokee ancestors in general, had sacrificed to reach this moment. I think that a lot of other tribal citizens felt that the day that we were celebrating the Supreme Court decision. I think we all felt that weight of history. And I wanted the reader to feel that weight of history \u2014 to understand this isn\u2019t a simple story of, \u201cYay, the tribes won!\u201d There\u2019s a lot that\u2019s implicated in that victory and a lot that was lost for that rare legal victory to happen.</p> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the book you hold multiple difficult truths at once, like how George Jacobs\u2019 death \u2014 which caused so much pain for his community \u2014 was the origin of the Murphy case and also resulted in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. Similarly, the truth of your ancestor, John Ridge, who signed a treaty that resulted in forced removal of the Cherokee people. It was against their wishes, and also what he thought he had to do to save his nation. How did you navigate that? It can be so easy to collapse these tensions to make for a simpler narrative.&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> Absolutely. As a journalist, my North Star is the truth. And I think the truth is complicated. I don\u2019t think we can tell the whole story of the <em>McGirt</em> victory without talking about the crimes and the tragedy that it originated in. And I think the same is true for my ancestors. I was sort of raised to think one thing, but I went back through the historical records and really tried to look at it for what it was. There\u2019s a lot that we can learn from the desperation of my ancestors and their decision to sign that treaty. We can learn just how violent U.S. policy was at that time, that they would make a decision like that. There\u2019s a cultural impulse to tell stories where there are clear heroes and clear villains, and victories like <em>McGirt</em> come from a good place, and things are clean-cut. I think that history is actually quite messy. I wanted a book that reflected that reality.</p> <!-- RTT removed image (333265) --> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the aftermath of the McGirt decision, the state of Oklahoma pushed a narrative of chaos and disruption in the criminal justice system, which some national outlets then repeated without much discernment. Can you talk about the role of the media \u2014 including the lack of Indigenous representation in newsrooms \u2014 and how that shapes the public\u2019s understanding of things like tribal sovereignty?</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> I think that it\u2019s a really big hindrance to our rights as Indigenous nations and to our sovereignty. Less than a fraction of a percent of the people staffing newsrooms are Native. Coverage of Indigenous issues very often fails to meet the standards of journalism. It doesn\u2019t have context, or a depth of knowledge of what\u2019s going on. They send reporters who\u2019ve never been on a reservation to do reporting about criminal justice on tribal land.

Smith, High Country NewsMarch 25, 2025<h1>Rebecca Nagle considers Supreme Court wins and what\u2019s at stake for tribes under Trump</h1> <p class=\"byline\">by Anna V. Smith, High Country News <br />March 25, 2025</p> <p class=\"has-drop-cap\">During the forced<strong> </strong>removal of Muscogee (Creek) people from their ancestral lands in the Southeastern U.S., tribal members carried the embers and ashes of their town fires with them, determined to re-establish the flames in the new communities they planned to build in what\u2019s now known as Oklahoma. Those fires still burn today in places on the Muscogee Reservation.</p> <div class=\"wp-block-group alignright\"> <!-- RTT removed image (333291) --> <p class=\"has-text-align-left\"><em><em>By the Fire We Carry</em> </em><br />By Rebecca Nagle<br />352 pages, hardcover: $30<br />Harper, 2024.</p> </p></div> <p>In <em>By the Fire We Carry</em>, Cherokee journalist Rebecca Nagle documents the interwoven stories of tribal land dispossession, forced removal, a murder in a small tribal community, her own family history and three recent and consequential Supreme Court decisions about tribal jurisdiction over lands in Oklahoma. Two of them, <em>Murphy v. Oklahoma</em> and <em>McGirt v. Oklahoma, </em>centered on crimes on land that the state of Oklahoma argued was no longer part of the Muscogee and Cherokee Nations\u2019 respective reservations. In both cases, the Supreme Court upheld the tribes\u2019 arguments in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. But shortly after came <em>Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta</em>, in which the Supreme Court sidestepped a century of federal Indian law and gave states jurisdiction to prosecute crimes on tribal lands when the perpetrator was non-Native and the victim was Native. The connections Nagle makes span generations and offer insight into our current political turmoil, at a time when a second Trump administration is testing the limits of executive authority and the law.</p> <p>In a conversation with <em>High Country News</em>, Nagle discusses how the U.S. still wields its power of empire, what impact the Trump administration could have on tribal sovereignty, and the enduring weight of history.</p> <p><em>This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p> <p><strong><em>High Country News</em></strong>: <strong>In this book, you don\u2019t just focus on the 20-year histories of these three Supreme Court cases but also tell the stories of the Muscogee and Cherokee nations before the U.S. existed. Why did you decide to take such a long view?</strong></p> <p><strong>Rebecca Nagle:</strong> One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present. I also wanted people to get a sense of how history repeats itself, and how things like a lie that tribal land is lawless get used over and over again, or the excuse that, \u201cOh, <em>this</em> is actually what\u2019s best for Native people.\u201d I wanted people to be able to see and identify those patterns.&nbsp;</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present.</p> </blockquote> <p>When I found out about the <em>McGirt</em> decision and saw the implications that my tribe\u2019s reservation would be recognized again, it was a really overwhelming emotion of relief, of joy, but there was also a lot of sadness, because I knew how much my ancestors, and Cherokee ancestors in general, had sacrificed to reach this moment. I think that a lot of other tribal citizens felt that the day that we were celebrating the Supreme Court decision. I think we all felt that weight of history. And I wanted the reader to feel that weight of history \u2014 to understand this isn\u2019t a simple story of, \u201cYay, the tribes won!\u201d There\u2019s a lot that\u2019s implicated in that victory and a lot that was lost for that rare legal victory to happen.</p> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the book you hold multiple difficult truths at once, like how George Jacobs\u2019 death \u2014 which caused so much pain for his community \u2014 was the origin of the Murphy case and also resulted in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. Similarly, the truth of your ancestor, John Ridge, who signed a treaty that resulted in forced removal of the Cherokee people. It was against their wishes, and also what he thought he had to do to save his nation. How did you navigate that? It can be so easy to collapse these tensions to make for a simpler narrative.&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> Absolutely. As a journalist, my North Star is the truth. And I think the truth is complicated. I don\u2019t think we can tell the whole story of the <em>McGirt</em> victory without talking about the crimes and the tragedy that it originated in. And I think the same is true for my ancestors. I was sort of raised to think one thing, but I went back through the historical records and really tried to look at it for what it was. There\u2019s a lot that we can learn from the desperation of my ancestors and their decision to sign that treaty. We can learn just how violent U.S. policy was at that time, that they would make a decision like that. There\u2019s a cultural impulse to tell stories where there are clear heroes and clear villains, and victories like <em>McGirt</em> come from a good place, and things are clean-cut. I think that history is actually quite messy. I wanted a book that reflected that reality.</p> <!-- RTT removed image (333265) --> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the aftermath of the McGirt decision, the state of Oklahoma pushed a narrative of chaos and disruption in the criminal justice system, which some national outlets then repeated without much discernment. Can you talk about the role of the media \u2014 including the lack of Indigenous representation in newsrooms \u2014 and how that shapes the public\u2019s understanding of things like tribal sovereignty?</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> I think that it\u2019s a really big hindrance to our rights as Indigenous nations and to our sovereignty. Less than a fraction of a percent of the people staffing newsrooms are Native. Coverage of Indigenous issues very often fails to meet the standards of journalism. It doesn\u2019t have context, or a depth of knowledge of what\u2019s going on. They send reporters who\u2019ve never been on a reservation to do reporting about criminal justice on tribal land. It creates an environment where you can tell lies about tribes, and people will think that it\u2019s true.</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> </blockquote> <p>And unfortunately, that\u2019s what happened. In the wake of <em>McGirt</em>, (Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, R) made some very bold and outlandish claims about the number of criminal cases that could be prosecuted moving forward. I did some digging around with a fellow reporter, Allison Herrera, and Oklahoma\u2019s claims fell apart completely. But they were still repeated and cited by prominent outlets like the <em>Washington Post</em> and <em>The Wall Street Journal.</em> Oklahoma then cited those articles in their briefs, and some of that inaccurate information was actually in the (<em>Castro-Huerta</em>) Supreme Court decision. And so it was this tornado of disinformation that made it all the way up to the Supreme Court. Normally, we think that the <em>Washington Post</em> is a check on bad information, but not when it comes to tribes, which should be an embarrassment for them.</p> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>We\u2019re in a moment of major law and policy change under a new administration. What are some lessons from your reporting that apply to our current moment?</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> We talk about it as a problem that originates with Trump, instead of a problem that originates with some of the flaws in our democracy. And I think the treatment of Indigenous nations is a glaring example of that, because we\u2019ve never had any kind of constitutional amendment or reform to change those laws and to change those policies.

Smith, High Country NewsMarch 25, 2025<h1>Rebecca Nagle considers Supreme Court wins and what\u2019s at stake for tribes under Trump</h1> <p class=\"byline\">by Anna V. Smith, High Country News <br />March 25, 2025</p> <p class=\"has-drop-cap\">During the forced<strong> </strong>removal of Muscogee (Creek) people from their ancestral lands in the Southeastern U.S., tribal members carried the embers and ashes of their town fires with them, determined to re-establish the flames in the new communities they planned to build in what\u2019s now known as Oklahoma. Those fires still burn today in places on the Muscogee Reservation.</p> <div class=\"wp-block-group alignright\"> <!-- RTT removed image (333291) --> <p class=\"has-text-align-left\"><em><em>By the Fire We Carry</em> </em><br />By Rebecca Nagle<br />352 pages, hardcover: $30<br />Harper, 2024.</p> </p></div> <p>In <em>By the Fire We Carry</em>, Cherokee journalist Rebecca Nagle documents the interwoven stories of tribal land dispossession, forced removal, a murder in a small tribal community, her own family history and three recent and consequential Supreme Court decisions about tribal jurisdiction over lands in Oklahoma. Two of them, <em>Murphy v. Oklahoma</em> and <em>McGirt v. Oklahoma, </em>centered on crimes on land that the state of Oklahoma argued was no longer part of the Muscogee and Cherokee Nations\u2019 respective reservations. In both cases, the Supreme Court upheld the tribes\u2019 arguments in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. But shortly after came <em>Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta</em>, in which the Supreme Court sidestepped a century of federal Indian law and gave states jurisdiction to prosecute crimes on tribal lands when the perpetrator was non-Native and the victim was Native. The connections Nagle makes span generations and offer insight into our current political turmoil, at a time when a second Trump administration is testing the limits of executive authority and the law.</p> <p>In a conversation with <em>High Country News</em>, Nagle discusses how the U.S. still wields its power of empire, what impact the Trump administration could have on tribal sovereignty, and the enduring weight of history.</p> <p><em>This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p> <p><strong><em>High Country News</em></strong>: <strong>In this book, you don\u2019t just focus on the 20-year histories of these three Supreme Court cases but also tell the stories of the Muscogee and Cherokee nations before the U.S. existed.

I also wanted people to get a sense of how history repeats itself, and how things like a lie that tribal land is lawless get used over and over again, or the excuse that, \u201cOh, <em>this</em> is actually what\u2019s best for Native people.\u201d I wanted people to be able to see and identify those patterns.&nbsp;</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present.</p> </blockquote> <p>When I found out about the <em>McGirt</em> decision and saw the implications that my tribe\u2019s reservation would be recognized again, it was a really overwhelming emotion of relief, of joy, but there was also a lot of sadness, because I knew how much my ancestors, and Cherokee ancestors in general, had sacrificed to reach this moment. I think that a lot of other tribal citizens felt that the day that we were celebrating the Supreme Court decision. I think we all felt that weight of history.

There\u2019s a lot that we can learn from the desperation of my ancestors and their decision to sign that treaty. We can learn just how violent U.S. policy was at that time, that they would make a decision like that. There\u2019s a cultural impulse to tell stories where there are clear heroes and clear villains, and victories like <em>McGirt</em> come from a good place, and things are clean-cut.

Smith, High Country NewsMarch 25, 2025<h1>Rebecca Nagle considers Supreme Court wins and what\u2019s at stake for tribes under Trump</h1> <p class=\"byline\">by Anna V. Smith, High Country News <br />March 25, 2025</p> <p class=\"has-drop-cap\">During the forced<strong> </strong>removal of Muscogee (Creek) people from their ancestral lands in the Southeastern U.S., tribal members carried the embers and ashes of their town fires with them, determined to re-establish the flames in the new communities they planned to build in what\u2019s now known as Oklahoma. Those fires still burn today in places on the Muscogee Reservation.</p> <div class=\"wp-block-group alignright\"> <!-- RTT removed image (333291) --> <p class=\"has-text-align-left\"><em><em>By the Fire We Carry</em> </em><br />By Rebecca Nagle<br />352 pages, hardcover: $30<br />Harper, 2024.</p> </p></div> <p>In <em>By the Fire We Carry</em>, Cherokee journalist Rebecca Nagle documents the interwoven stories of tribal land dispossession, forced removal, a murder in a small tribal community, her own family history and three recent and consequential Supreme Court decisions about tribal jurisdiction over lands in Oklahoma. Two of them, <em>Murphy v. Oklahoma</em> and <em>McGirt v. Oklahoma, </em>centered on crimes on land that the state of Oklahoma argued was no longer part of the Muscogee and Cherokee Nations\u2019 respective reservations. In both cases, the Supreme Court upheld the tribes\u2019 arguments in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. But shortly after came <em>Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta</em>, in which the Supreme Court sidestepped a century of federal Indian law and gave states jurisdiction to prosecute crimes on tribal lands when the perpetrator was non-Native and the victim was Native. The connections Nagle makes span generations and offer insight into our current political turmoil, at a time when a second Trump administration is testing the limits of executive authority and the law.</p> <p>In a conversation with <em>High Country News</em>, Nagle discusses how the U.S. still wields its power of empire, what impact the Trump administration could have on tribal sovereignty, and the enduring weight of history.</p> <p><em>This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p> <p><strong><em>High Country News</em></strong>: <strong>In this book, you don\u2019t just focus on the 20-year histories of these three Supreme Court cases but also tell the stories of the Muscogee and Cherokee nations before the U.S. existed.

A lot of tribal programs, whether it\u2019s (the Indian Health Service) or tribal courts, tribal law enforcement, rely on federal dollars. There\u2019s a lot specifically at stake for tribes under Trump. The remaking of the federal judiciary has a profound impact on tribes, because our cases are federal; they don\u2019t go through state court. And, unfortunately, the courts \u2014 dating back to before Trump \u2014 have not been reliable sources for justice for tribes. Even when the law is clearly on the tribe\u2019s side, courts have a very bad habit of bending and breaking the rules to satisfy the state or non-Native residents. One of the things that\u2019s really shocked me is how often our government institutions ignore the law when it comes to tribes and how hard tribes have to fight for just the law to be followed.

Smith, High Country NewsMarch 25, 2025<h1>Rebecca Nagle considers Supreme Court wins and what\u2019s at stake for tribes under Trump</h1> <p class=\"byline\">by Anna V. Smith, High Country News <br />March 25, 2025</p> <p class=\"has-drop-cap\">During the forced<strong> </strong>removal of Muscogee (Creek) people from their ancestral lands in the Southeastern U.S., tribal members carried the embers and ashes of their town fires with them, determined to re-establish the flames in the new communities they planned to build in what\u2019s now known as Oklahoma. Those fires still burn today in places on the Muscogee Reservation.</p> <div class=\"wp-block-group alignright\"> <!-- RTT removed image (333291) --> <p class=\"has-text-align-left\"><em><em>By the Fire We Carry</em> </em><br />By Rebecca Nagle<br />352 pages, hardcover: $30<br />Harper, 2024.</p> </p></div> <p>In <em>By the Fire We Carry</em>, Cherokee journalist Rebecca Nagle documents the interwoven stories of tribal land dispossession, forced removal, a murder in a small tribal community, her own family history and three recent and consequential Supreme Court decisions about tribal jurisdiction over lands in Oklahoma. Two of them, <em>Murphy v. Oklahoma</em> and <em>McGirt v. Oklahoma, </em>centered on crimes on land that the state of Oklahoma argued was no longer part of the Muscogee and Cherokee Nations\u2019 respective reservations. In both cases, the Supreme Court upheld the tribes\u2019 arguments in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. But shortly after came <em>Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta</em>, in which the Supreme Court sidestepped a century of federal Indian law and gave states jurisdiction to prosecute crimes on tribal lands when the perpetrator was non-Native and the victim was Native. The connections Nagle makes span generations and offer insight into our current political turmoil, at a time when a second Trump administration is testing the limits of executive authority and the law.</p> <p>In a conversation with <em>High Country News</em>, Nagle discusses how the U.S. still wields its power of empire, what impact the Trump administration could have on tribal sovereignty, and the enduring weight of history.</p> <p><em>This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p> <p><strong><em>High Country News</em></strong>: <strong>In this book, you don\u2019t just focus on the 20-year histories of these three Supreme Court cases but also tell the stories of the Muscogee and Cherokee nations before the U.S. existed. Why did you decide to take such a long view?</strong></p> <p><strong>Rebecca Nagle:</strong> One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present. I also wanted people to get a sense of how history repeats itself, and how things like a lie that tribal land is lawless get used over and over again, or the excuse that, \u201cOh, <em>this</em> is actually what\u2019s best for Native people.\u201d I wanted people to be able to see and identify those patterns.&nbsp;</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present.</p> </blockquote> <p>When I found out about the <em>McGirt</em> decision and saw the implications that my tribe\u2019s reservation would be recognized again, it was a really overwhelming emotion of relief, of joy, but there was also a lot of sadness, because I knew how much my ancestors, and Cherokee ancestors in general, had sacrificed to reach this moment. I think that a lot of other tribal citizens felt that the day that we were celebrating the Supreme Court decision. I think we all felt that weight of history. And I wanted the reader to feel that weight of history \u2014 to understand this isn\u2019t a simple story of, \u201cYay, the tribes won!\u201d There\u2019s a lot that\u2019s implicated in that victory and a lot that was lost for that rare legal victory to happen.</p> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the book you hold multiple difficult truths at once, like how George Jacobs\u2019 death \u2014 which caused so much pain for his community \u2014 was the origin of the Murphy case and also resulted in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. Similarly, the truth of your ancestor, John Ridge, who signed a treaty that resulted in forced removal of the Cherokee people. It was against their wishes, and also what he thought he had to do to save his nation. How did you navigate that? It can be so easy to collapse these tensions to make for a simpler narrative.&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> Absolutely. As a journalist, my North Star is the truth. And I think the truth is complicated. I don\u2019t think we can tell the whole story of the <em>McGirt</em> victory without talking about the crimes and the tragedy that it originated in. And I think the same is true for my ancestors. I was sort of raised to think one thing, but I went back through the historical records and really tried to look at it for what it was. There\u2019s a lot that we can learn from the desperation of my ancestors and their decision to sign that treaty. We can learn just how violent U.S. policy was at that time, that they would make a decision like that. There\u2019s a cultural impulse to tell stories where there are clear heroes and clear villains, and victories like <em>McGirt</em> come from a good place, and things are clean-cut. I think that history is actually quite messy. I wanted a book that reflected that reality.</p> <!-- RTT removed image (333265) --> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the aftermath of the McGirt decision, the state of Oklahoma pushed a narrative of chaos and disruption in the criminal justice system, which some national outlets then repeated without much discernment. Can you talk about the role of the media \u2014 including the lack of Indigenous representation in newsrooms \u2014 and how that shapes the public\u2019s understanding of things like tribal sovereignty?</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> I think that it\u2019s a really big hindrance to our rights as Indigenous nations and to our sovereignty. Less than a fraction of a percent of the people staffing newsrooms are Native. Coverage of Indigenous issues very often fails to meet the standards of journalism. It doesn\u2019t have context, or a depth of knowledge of what\u2019s going on. They send reporters who\u2019ve never been on a reservation to do reporting about criminal justice on tribal land.

I did some digging around with a fellow reporter, Allison Herrera, and Oklahoma\u2019s claims fell apart completely. But they were still repeated and cited by prominent outlets like the <em>Washington Post</em> and <em>The Wall Street Journal.</em> Oklahoma then cited those articles in their briefs, and some of that inaccurate information was actually in the (<em>Castro-Huerta</em>) Supreme Court decision. And so it was this tornado of disinformation that made it all the way up to the Supreme Court.

And I think the treatment of Indigenous nations is a glaring example of that, because we\u2019ve never had any kind of constitutional amendment or reform to change those laws and to change those policies. To dispossess Indigenous people of their land, the U.S. government gave itself a lot of power over people who are not U.S. citizens. That power of empire is embedded in our Constitution, because our country wanted to take Indigenous land. We still see it manifested in deportation and shutting down asylum and separating families at the border and banning Muslims from entering our country.

Smith, High Country NewsMarch 25, 2025<h1>Rebecca Nagle considers Supreme Court wins and what\u2019s at stake for tribes under Trump</h1> <p class=\"byline\">by Anna V. Smith, High Country News <br />March 25, 2025</p> <p class=\"has-drop-cap\">During the forced<strong> </strong>removal of Muscogee (Creek) people from their ancestral lands in the Southeastern U.S., tribal members carried the embers and ashes of their town fires with them, determined to re-establish the flames in the new communities they planned to build in what\u2019s now known as Oklahoma. Those fires still burn today in places on the Muscogee Reservation.</p> <div class=\"wp-block-group alignright\"> <!-- RTT removed image (333291) --> <p class=\"has-text-align-left\"><em><em>By the Fire We Carry</em> </em><br />By Rebecca Nagle<br />352 pages, hardcover: $30<br />Harper, 2024.</p> </p></div> <p>In <em>By the Fire We Carry</em>, Cherokee journalist Rebecca Nagle documents the interwoven stories of tribal land dispossession, forced removal, a murder in a small tribal community, her own family history and three recent and consequential Supreme Court decisions about tribal jurisdiction over lands in Oklahoma. Two of them, <em>Murphy v. Oklahoma</em> and <em>McGirt v. Oklahoma, </em>centered on crimes on land that the state of Oklahoma argued was no longer part of the Muscogee and Cherokee Nations\u2019 respective reservations. In both cases, the Supreme Court upheld the tribes\u2019 arguments in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. But shortly after came <em>Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta</em>, in which the Supreme Court sidestepped a century of federal Indian law and gave states jurisdiction to prosecute crimes on tribal lands when the perpetrator was non-Native and the victim was Native. The connections Nagle makes span generations and offer insight into our current political turmoil, at a time when a second Trump administration is testing the limits of executive authority and the law.</p> <p>In a conversation with <em>High Country News</em>, Nagle discusses how the U.S. still wields its power of empire, what impact the Trump administration could have on tribal sovereignty, and the enduring weight of history.</p> <p><em>This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p> <p><strong><em>High Country News</em></strong>: <strong>In this book, you don\u2019t just focus on the 20-year histories of these three Supreme Court cases but also tell the stories of the Muscogee and Cherokee nations before the U.S. existed. Why did you decide to take such a long view?</strong></p> <p><strong>Rebecca Nagle:</strong> One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present. I also wanted people to get a sense of how history repeats itself, and how things like a lie that tribal land is lawless get used over and over again, or the excuse that, \u201cOh, <em>this</em> is actually what\u2019s best for Native people.\u201d I wanted people to be able to see and identify those patterns.&nbsp;</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present.</p> </blockquote> <p>When I found out about the <em>McGirt</em> decision and saw the implications that my tribe\u2019s reservation would be recognized again, it was a really overwhelming emotion of relief, of joy, but there was also a lot of sadness, because I knew how much my ancestors, and Cherokee ancestors in general, had sacrificed to reach this moment. I think that a lot of other tribal citizens felt that the day that we were celebrating the Supreme Court decision. I think we all felt that weight of history. And I wanted the reader to feel that weight of history \u2014 to understand this isn\u2019t a simple story of, \u201cYay, the tribes won!\u201d There\u2019s a lot that\u2019s implicated in that victory and a lot that was lost for that rare legal victory to happen.</p> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the book you hold multiple difficult truths at once, like how George Jacobs\u2019 death \u2014 which caused so much pain for his community \u2014 was the origin of the Murphy case and also resulted in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. Similarly, the truth of your ancestor, John Ridge, who signed a treaty that resulted in forced removal of the Cherokee people. It was against their wishes, and also what he thought he had to do to save his nation. How did you navigate that? It can be so easy to collapse these tensions to make for a simpler narrative.&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> Absolutely. As a journalist, my North Star is the truth. And I think the truth is complicated. I don\u2019t think we can tell the whole story of the <em>McGirt</em> victory without talking about the crimes and the tragedy that it originated in. And I think the same is true for my ancestors. I was sort of raised to think one thing, but I went back through the historical records and really tried to look at it for what it was. There\u2019s a lot that we can learn from the desperation of my ancestors and their decision to sign that treaty. We can learn just how violent U.S. policy was at that time, that they would make a decision like that. There\u2019s a cultural impulse to tell stories where there are clear heroes and clear villains, and victories like <em>McGirt</em> come from a good place, and things are clean-cut. I think that history is actually quite messy. I wanted a book that reflected that reality.</p> <!-- RTT removed image (333265) --> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the aftermath of the McGirt decision, the state of Oklahoma pushed a narrative of chaos and disruption in the criminal justice system, which some national outlets then repeated without much discernment. Can you talk about the role of the media \u2014 including the lack of Indigenous representation in newsrooms \u2014 and how that shapes the public\u2019s understanding of things like tribal sovereignty?</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> I think that it\u2019s a really big hindrance to our rights as Indigenous nations and to our sovereignty. Less than a fraction of a percent of the people staffing newsrooms are Native. Coverage of Indigenous issues very often fails to meet the standards of journalism. It doesn\u2019t have context, or a depth of knowledge of what\u2019s going on. They send reporters who\u2019ve never been on a reservation to do reporting about criminal justice on tribal land. It creates an environment where you can tell lies about tribes, and people will think that it\u2019s true.</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> </blockquote> <p>And unfortunately, that\u2019s what happened.

I also wanted people to get a sense of how history repeats itself, and how things like a lie that tribal land is lawless get used over and over again, or the excuse that, \u201cOh, <em>this</em> is actually what\u2019s best for Native people.\u201d I wanted people to be able to see and identify those patterns.&nbsp;</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present.</p> </blockquote> <p>When I found out about the <em>McGirt</em> decision and saw the implications that my tribe\u2019s reservation would be recognized again, it was a really overwhelming emotion of relief, of joy, but there was also a lot of sadness, because I knew how much my ancestors, and Cherokee ancestors in general, had sacrificed to reach this moment. I think that a lot of other tribal citizens felt that the day that we were celebrating the Supreme Court decision. I think we all felt that weight of history. And I wanted the reader to feel that weight of history \u2014 to understand this isn\u2019t a simple story of, \u201cYay, the tribes won!\u201d There\u2019s a lot that\u2019s implicated in that victory and a lot that was lost for that rare legal victory to happen.</p> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the book you hold multiple difficult truths at once, like how George Jacobs\u2019 death \u2014 which caused so much pain for his community \u2014 was the origin of the Murphy case and also resulted in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. Similarly, the truth of your ancestor, John Ridge, who signed a treaty that resulted in forced removal of the Cherokee people. It was against their wishes, and also what he thought he had to do to save his nation. How did you navigate that? It can be so easy to collapse these tensions to make for a simpler narrative.&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> Absolutely. As a journalist, my North Star is the truth. And I think the truth is complicated. I don\u2019t think we can tell the whole story of the <em>McGirt</em> victory without talking about the crimes and the tragedy that it originated in. And I think the same is true for my ancestors. I was sort of raised to think one thing, but I went back through the historical records and really tried to look at it for what it was. There\u2019s a lot that we can learn from the desperation of my ancestors and their decision to sign that treaty. We can learn just how violent U.S. policy was at that time, that they would make a decision like that. There\u2019s a cultural impulse to tell stories where there are clear heroes and clear villains, and victories like <em>McGirt</em> come from a good place, and things are clean-cut. I think that history is actually quite messy. I wanted a book that reflected that reality.</p> <!-- RTT removed image (333265) --> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the aftermath of the McGirt decision, the state of Oklahoma pushed a narrative of chaos and disruption in the criminal justice system, which some national outlets then repeated without much discernment.

Less than a fraction of a percent of the people staffing newsrooms are Native. Coverage of Indigenous issues very often fails to meet the standards of journalism. It doesn\u2019t have context, or a depth of knowledge of what\u2019s going on. They send reporters who\u2019ve never been on a reservation to do reporting about criminal justice on tribal land.

In the wake of <em>McGirt</em>, (Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, R) made some very bold and outlandish claims about the number of criminal cases that could be prosecuted moving forward. I did some digging around with a fellow reporter, Allison Herrera, and Oklahoma\u2019s claims fell apart completely. But they were still repeated and cited by prominent outlets like the <em>Washington Post</em> and <em>The Wall Street Journal.</em> Oklahoma then cited those articles in their briefs, and some of that inaccurate information was actually in the (<em>Castro-Huerta</em>) Supreme Court decision. And so it was this tornado of disinformation that made it all the way up to the Supreme Court. Normally, we think that the <em>Washington Post</em> is a check on bad information, but not when it comes to tribes, which should be an embarrassment for them.</p> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>We\u2019re in a moment of major law and policy change under a new administration.

And I think the treatment of Indigenous nations is a glaring example of that, because we\u2019ve never had any kind of constitutional amendment or reform to change those laws and to change those policies. To dispossess Indigenous people of their land, the U.S. government gave itself a lot of power over people who are not U.S. citizens.

Smith, High Country NewsMarch 25, 2025<h1>Rebecca Nagle considers Supreme Court wins and what\u2019s at stake for tribes under Trump</h1> <p class=\"byline\">by Anna V. Smith, High Country News <br />March 25, 2025</p> <p class=\"has-drop-cap\">During the forced<strong> </strong>removal of Muscogee (Creek) people from their ancestral lands in the Southeastern U.S., tribal members carried the embers and ashes of their town fires with them, determined to re-establish the flames in the new communities they planned to build in what\u2019s now known as Oklahoma. Those fires still burn today in places on the Muscogee Reservation.</p> <div class=\"wp-block-group alignright\"> <!-- RTT removed image (333291) --> <p class=\"has-text-align-left\"><em><em>By the Fire We Carry</em> </em><br />By Rebecca Nagle<br />352 pages, hardcover: $30<br />Harper, 2024.</p> </p></div> <p>In <em>By the Fire We Carry</em>, Cherokee journalist Rebecca Nagle documents the interwoven stories of tribal land dispossession, forced removal, a murder in a small tribal community, her own family history and three recent and consequential Supreme Court decisions about tribal jurisdiction over lands in Oklahoma. Two of them, <em>Murphy v. Oklahoma</em> and <em>McGirt v. Oklahoma, </em>centered on crimes on land that the state of Oklahoma argued was no longer part of the Muscogee and Cherokee Nations\u2019 respective reservations. In both cases, the Supreme Court upheld the tribes\u2019 arguments in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. But shortly after came <em>Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta</em>, in which the Supreme Court sidestepped a century of federal Indian law and gave states jurisdiction to prosecute crimes on tribal lands when the perpetrator was non-Native and the victim was Native. The connections Nagle makes span generations and offer insight into our current political turmoil, at a time when a second Trump administration is testing the limits of executive authority and the law.</p> <p>In a conversation with <em>High Country News</em>, Nagle discusses how the U.S. still wields its power of empire, what impact the Trump administration could have on tribal sovereignty, and the enduring weight of history.</p> <p><em>This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p> <p><strong><em>High Country News</em></strong>: <strong>In this book, you don\u2019t just focus on the 20-year histories of these three Supreme Court cases but also tell the stories of the Muscogee and Cherokee nations before the U.S. existed.

Smith, High Country NewsMarch 25, 2025<h1>Rebecca Nagle considers Supreme Court wins and what\u2019s at stake for tribes under Trump</h1> <p class=\"byline\">by Anna V. Smith, High Country News <br />March 25, 2025</p> <p class=\"has-drop-cap\">During the forced<strong> </strong>removal of Muscogee (Creek) people from their ancestral lands in the Southeastern U.S., tribal members carried the embers and ashes of their town fires with them, determined to re-establish the flames in the new communities they planned to build in what\u2019s now known as Oklahoma. Those fires still burn today in places on the Muscogee Reservation.</p> <div class=\"wp-block-group alignright\"> <!-- RTT removed image (333291) --> <p class=\"has-text-align-left\"><em><em>By the Fire We Carry</em> </em><br />By Rebecca Nagle<br />352 pages, hardcover: $30<br />Harper, 2024.</p> </p></div> <p>In <em>By the Fire We Carry</em>, Cherokee journalist Rebecca Nagle documents the interwoven stories of tribal land dispossession, forced removal, a murder in a small tribal community, her own family history and three recent and consequential Supreme Court decisions about tribal jurisdiction over lands in Oklahoma. Two of them, <em>Murphy v. Oklahoma</em> and <em>McGirt v. Oklahoma, </em>centered on crimes on land that the state of Oklahoma argued was no longer part of the Muscogee and Cherokee Nations\u2019 respective reservations. In both cases, the Supreme Court upheld the tribes\u2019 arguments in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. But shortly after came <em>Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta</em>, in which the Supreme Court sidestepped a century of federal Indian law and gave states jurisdiction to prosecute crimes on tribal lands when the perpetrator was non-Native and the victim was Native. The connections Nagle makes span generations and offer insight into our current political turmoil, at a time when a second Trump administration is testing the limits of executive authority and the law.</p> <p>In a conversation with <em>High Country News</em>, Nagle discusses how the U.S. still wields its power of empire, what impact the Trump administration could have on tribal sovereignty, and the enduring weight of history.</p> <p><em>This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p> <p><strong><em>High Country News</em></strong>: <strong>In this book, you don\u2019t just focus on the 20-year histories of these three Supreme Court cases but also tell the stories of the Muscogee and Cherokee nations before the U.S. existed. Why did you decide to take such a long view?</strong></p> <p><strong>Rebecca Nagle:</strong> One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present. I also wanted people to get a sense of how history repeats itself, and how things like a lie that tribal land is lawless get used over and over again, or the excuse that, \u201cOh, <em>this</em> is actually what\u2019s best for Native people.\u201d I wanted people to be able to see and identify those patterns.&nbsp;</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present.</p> </blockquote> <p>When I found out about the <em>McGirt</em> decision and saw the implications that my tribe\u2019s reservation would be recognized again, it was a really overwhelming emotion of relief, of joy, but there was also a lot of sadness, because I knew how much my ancestors, and Cherokee ancestors in general, had sacrificed to reach this moment. I think that a lot of other tribal citizens felt that the day that we were celebrating the Supreme Court decision. I think we all felt that weight of history. And I wanted the reader to feel that weight of history \u2014 to understand this isn\u2019t a simple story of, \u201cYay, the tribes won!\u201d There\u2019s a lot that\u2019s implicated in that victory and a lot that was lost for that rare legal victory to happen.</p> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the book you hold multiple difficult truths at once, like how George Jacobs\u2019 death \u2014 which caused so much pain for his community \u2014 was the origin of the Murphy case and also resulted in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. Similarly, the truth of your ancestor, John Ridge, who signed a treaty that resulted in forced removal of the Cherokee people. It was against their wishes, and also what he thought he had to do to save his nation. How did you navigate that? It can be so easy to collapse these tensions to make for a simpler narrative.&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> Absolutely. As a journalist, my North Star is the truth. And I think the truth is complicated. I don\u2019t think we can tell the whole story of the <em>McGirt</em> victory without talking about the crimes and the tragedy that it originated in. And I think the same is true for my ancestors. I was sort of raised to think one thing, but I went back through the historical records and really tried to look at it for what it was. There\u2019s a lot that we can learn from the desperation of my ancestors and their decision to sign that treaty. We can learn just how violent U.S. policy was at that time, that they would make a decision like that. There\u2019s a cultural impulse to tell stories where there are clear heroes and clear villains, and victories like <em>McGirt</em> come from a good place, and things are clean-cut. I think that history is actually quite messy. I wanted a book that reflected that reality.</p> <!-- RTT removed image (333265) --> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the aftermath of the McGirt decision, the state of Oklahoma pushed a narrative of chaos and disruption in the criminal justice system, which some national outlets then repeated without much discernment. Can you talk about the role of the media \u2014 including the lack of Indigenous representation in newsrooms \u2014 and how that shapes the public\u2019s understanding of things like tribal sovereignty?</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> I think that it\u2019s a really big hindrance to our rights as Indigenous nations and to our sovereignty. Less than a fraction of a percent of the people staffing newsrooms are Native. Coverage of Indigenous issues very often fails to meet the standards of journalism. It doesn\u2019t have context, or a depth of knowledge of what\u2019s going on. They send reporters who\u2019ve never been on a reservation to do reporting about criminal justice on tribal land. It creates an environment where you can tell lies about tribes, and people will think that it\u2019s true.</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> </blockquote> <p>And unfortunately, that\u2019s what happened. In the wake of <em>McGirt</em>, (Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, R) made some very bold and outlandish claims about the number of criminal cases that could be prosecuted moving forward. I did some digging around with a fellow reporter, Allison Herrera, and Oklahoma\u2019s claims fell apart completely. But they were still repeated and cited by prominent outlets like the <em>Washington Post</em> and <em>The Wall Street Journal.</em> Oklahoma then cited those articles in their briefs, and some of that inaccurate information was actually in the (<em>Castro-Huerta</em>) Supreme Court decision. And so it was this tornado of disinformation that made it all the way up to the Supreme Court. Normally, we think that the <em>Washington Post</em> is a check on bad information, but not when it comes to tribes, which should be an embarrassment for them.</p> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>We\u2019re in a moment of major law and policy change under a new administration. What are some lessons from your reporting that apply to our current moment?</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> We talk about it as a problem that originates with Trump, instead of a problem that originates with some of the flaws in our democracy. And I think the treatment of Indigenous nations is a glaring example of that, because we\u2019ve never had any kind of constitutional amendment or reform to change those laws and to change those policies. To dispossess Indigenous people of their land, the U.S. government gave itself a lot of power over people who are not U.S. citizens. That power of empire is embedded in our Constitution, because our country wanted to take Indigenous land. We still see it manifested in deportation and shutting down asylum and separating families at the border and banning Muslims from entering our country. If we really don\u2019t want these types of policies to be enacted, there are some bigger questions about our democracy that as a society we haven\u2019t even begun to ask.</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p> If we really don\u2019t want these types of policies to be enacted, there are some bigger questions about our democracy that as a society we haven\u2019t even begun to ask.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>Given that, do you have any specific concerns about potential attacks on tribal sovereignty under a second Trump administration?</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> Everything has the capacity to get worse. A lot of tribal programs, whether it\u2019s (the Indian Health Service) or tribal courts, tribal law enforcement, rely on federal dollars. There\u2019s a lot specifically at stake for tribes under Trump. The remaking of the federal judiciary has a profound impact on tribes, because our cases are federal; they don\u2019t go through state court. And, unfortunately, the courts \u2014 dating back to before Trump \u2014 have not been reliable sources for justice for tribes. Even when the law is clearly on the tribe\u2019s side, courts have a very bad habit of bending and breaking the rules to satisfy the state or non-Native residents. One of the things that\u2019s really shocked me is how often our government institutions ignore the law when it comes to tribes and how hard tribes have to fight for just the law to be followed. Those weaknesses in our democracy have been there for a long time.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p> <p><em>We welcome reader letters.

Smith, High Country NewsMarch 25, 2025<h1>Rebecca Nagle considers Supreme Court wins and what\u2019s at stake for tribes under Trump</h1> <p class=\"byline\">by Anna V. Smith, High Country News <br />March 25, 2025</p> <p class=\"has-drop-cap\">During the forced<strong> </strong>removal of Muscogee (Creek) people from their ancestral lands in the Southeastern U.S., tribal members carried the embers and ashes of their town fires with them, determined to re-establish the flames in the new communities they planned to build in what\u2019s now known as Oklahoma. Those fires still burn today in places on the Muscogee Reservation.</p> <div class=\"wp-block-group alignright\"> <!-- RTT removed image (333291) --> <p class=\"has-text-align-left\"><em><em>By the Fire We Carry</em> </em><br />By Rebecca Nagle<br />352 pages, hardcover: $30<br />Harper, 2024.</p> </p></div> <p>In <em>By the Fire We Carry</em>, Cherokee journalist Rebecca Nagle documents the interwoven stories of tribal land dispossession, forced removal, a murder in a small tribal community, her own family history and three recent and consequential Supreme Court decisions about tribal jurisdiction over lands in Oklahoma. Two of them, <em>Murphy v. Oklahoma</em> and <em>McGirt v. Oklahoma, </em>centered on crimes on land that the state of Oklahoma argued was no longer part of the Muscogee and Cherokee Nations\u2019 respective reservations. In both cases, the Supreme Court upheld the tribes\u2019 arguments in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. But shortly after came <em>Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta</em>, in which the Supreme Court sidestepped a century of federal Indian law and gave states jurisdiction to prosecute crimes on tribal lands when the perpetrator was non-Native and the victim was Native. The connections Nagle makes span generations and offer insight into our current political turmoil, at a time when a second Trump administration is testing the limits of executive authority and the law.</p> <p>In a conversation with <em>High Country News</em>, Nagle discusses how the U.S. still wields its power of empire, what impact the Trump administration could have on tribal sovereignty, and the enduring weight of history.</p> <p><em>This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p> <p><strong><em>High Country News</em></strong>: <strong>In this book, you don\u2019t just focus on the 20-year histories of these three Supreme Court cases but also tell the stories of the Muscogee and Cherokee nations before the U.S. existed. Why did you decide to take such a long view?</strong></p> <p><strong>Rebecca Nagle:</strong> One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present. I also wanted people to get a sense of how history repeats itself, and how things like a lie that tribal land is lawless get used over and over again, or the excuse that, \u201cOh, <em>this</em> is actually what\u2019s best for Native people.\u201d I wanted people to be able to see and identify those patterns.&nbsp;</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present.</p> </blockquote> <p>When I found out about the <em>McGirt</em> decision and saw the implications that my tribe\u2019s reservation would be recognized again, it was a really overwhelming emotion of relief, of joy, but there was also a lot of sadness, because I knew how much my ancestors, and Cherokee ancestors in general, had sacrificed to reach this moment. I think that a lot of other tribal citizens felt that the day that we were celebrating the Supreme Court decision. I think we all felt that weight of history. And I wanted the reader to feel that weight of history \u2014 to understand this isn\u2019t a simple story of, \u201cYay, the tribes won!\u201d There\u2019s a lot that\u2019s implicated in that victory and a lot that was lost for that rare legal victory to happen.</p> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the book you hold multiple difficult truths at once, like how George Jacobs\u2019 death \u2014 which caused so much pain for his community \u2014 was the origin of the Murphy case and also resulted in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. Similarly, the truth of your ancestor, John Ridge, who signed a treaty that resulted in forced removal of the Cherokee people. It was against their wishes, and also what he thought he had to do to save his nation. How did you navigate that? It can be so easy to collapse these tensions to make for a simpler narrative.&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> Absolutely. As a journalist, my North Star is the truth. And I think the truth is complicated. I don\u2019t think we can tell the whole story of the <em>McGirt</em> victory without talking about the crimes and the tragedy that it originated in. And I think the same is true for my ancestors. I was sort of raised to think one thing, but I went back through the historical records and really tried to look at it for what it was. There\u2019s a lot that we can learn from the desperation of my ancestors and their decision to sign that treaty. We can learn just how violent U.S. policy was at that time, that they would make a decision like that. There\u2019s a cultural impulse to tell stories where there are clear heroes and clear villains, and victories like <em>McGirt</em> come from a good place, and things are clean-cut. I think that history is actually quite messy. I wanted a book that reflected that reality.</p> <!-- RTT removed image (333265) --> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the aftermath of the McGirt decision, the state of Oklahoma pushed a narrative of chaos and disruption in the criminal justice system, which some national outlets then repeated without much discernment. Can you talk about the role of the media \u2014 including the lack of Indigenous representation in newsrooms \u2014 and how that shapes the public\u2019s understanding of things like tribal sovereignty?</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> I think that it\u2019s a really big hindrance to our rights as Indigenous nations and to our sovereignty. Less than a fraction of a percent of the people staffing newsrooms are Native. Coverage of Indigenous issues very often fails to meet the standards of journalism. It doesn\u2019t have context, or a depth of knowledge of what\u2019s going on. They send reporters who\u2019ve never been on a reservation to do reporting about criminal justice on tribal land.

But they were still repeated and cited by prominent outlets like the <em>Washington Post</em> and <em>The Wall Street Journal.</em> Oklahoma then cited those articles in their briefs, and some of that inaccurate information was actually in the (<em>Castro-Huerta</em>) Supreme Court decision.

And I think the treatment of Indigenous nations is a glaring example of that, because we\u2019ve never had any kind of constitutional amendment or reform to change those laws and to change those policies. To dispossess Indigenous people of their land, the U.S. government gave itself a lot of power over people who are not U.S. citizens. That power of empire is embedded in our Constitution, because our country wanted to take Indigenous land. We still see it manifested in deportation and shutting down asylum and separating families at the border and banning Muslims from entering our country. If we really don\u2019t want these types of policies to be enacted, there are some bigger questions about our democracy that as a society we haven\u2019t even begun to ask.</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p> If we really don\u2019t want these types of policies to be enacted, there are some bigger questions about our democracy that as a society we haven\u2019t even begun to ask.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>Given that, do you have any specific concerns about potential attacks on tribal sovereignty under a second Trump administration?</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> Everything has the capacity to get worse.

Smith, High Country NewsMarch 25, 2025<h1>Rebecca Nagle considers Supreme Court wins and what\u2019s at stake for tribes under Trump</h1> <p class=\"byline\">by Anna V. Smith, High Country News <br />March 25, 2025</p> <p class=\"has-drop-cap\">During the forced<strong> </strong>removal of Muscogee (Creek) people from their ancestral lands in the Southeastern U.S., tribal members carried the embers and ashes of their town fires with them, determined to re-establish the flames in the new communities they planned to build in what\u2019s now known as Oklahoma. Those fires still burn today in places on the Muscogee Reservation.</p> <div class=\"wp-block-group alignright\"> <!-- RTT removed image (333291) --> <p class=\"has-text-align-left\"><em><em>By the Fire We Carry</em> </em><br />By Rebecca Nagle<br />352 pages, hardcover: $30<br />Harper, 2024.</p> </p></div> <p>In <em>By the Fire We Carry</em>, Cherokee journalist Rebecca Nagle documents the interwoven stories of tribal land dispossession, forced removal, a murder in a small tribal community, her own family history and three recent and consequential Supreme Court decisions about tribal jurisdiction over lands in Oklahoma. Two of them, <em>Murphy v. Oklahoma</em> and <em>McGirt v. Oklahoma, </em>centered on crimes on land that the state of Oklahoma argued was no longer part of the Muscogee and Cherokee Nations\u2019 respective reservations. In both cases, the Supreme Court upheld the tribes\u2019 arguments in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. But shortly after came <em>Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta</em>, in which the Supreme Court sidestepped a century of federal Indian law and gave states jurisdiction to prosecute crimes on tribal lands when the perpetrator was non-Native and the victim was Native. The connections Nagle makes span generations and offer insight into our current political turmoil, at a time when a second Trump administration is testing the limits of executive authority and the law.</p> <p>In a conversation with <em>High Country News</em>, Nagle discusses how the U.S. still wields its power of empire, what impact the Trump administration could have on tribal sovereignty, and the enduring weight of history.</p> <p><em>This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p> <p><strong><em>High Country News</em></strong>: <strong>In this book, you don\u2019t just focus on the 20-year histories of these three Supreme Court cases but also tell the stories of the Muscogee and Cherokee nations before the U.S. existed. Why did you decide to take such a long view?</strong></p> <p><strong>Rebecca Nagle:</strong> One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present. I also wanted people to get a sense of how history repeats itself, and how things like a lie that tribal land is lawless get used over and over again, or the excuse that, \u201cOh, <em>this</em> is actually what\u2019s best for Native people.\u201d I wanted people to be able to see and identify those patterns.&nbsp;</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present.</p> </blockquote> <p>When I found out about the <em>McGirt</em> decision and saw the implications that my tribe\u2019s reservation would be recognized again, it was a really overwhelming emotion of relief, of joy, but there was also a lot of sadness, because I knew how much my ancestors, and Cherokee ancestors in general, had sacrificed to reach this moment. I think that a lot of other tribal citizens felt that the day that we were celebrating the Supreme Court decision. I think we all felt that weight of history. And I wanted the reader to feel that weight of history \u2014 to understand this isn\u2019t a simple story of, \u201cYay, the tribes won!\u201d There\u2019s a lot that\u2019s implicated in that victory and a lot that was lost for that rare legal victory to happen.</p> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the book you hold multiple difficult truths at once, like how George Jacobs\u2019 death \u2014 which caused so much pain for his community \u2014 was the origin of the Murphy case and also resulted in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. Similarly, the truth of your ancestor, John Ridge, who signed a treaty that resulted in forced removal of the Cherokee people. It was against their wishes, and also what he thought he had to do to save his nation. How did you navigate that? It can be so easy to collapse these tensions to make for a simpler narrative.&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> Absolutely. As a journalist, my North Star is the truth. And I think the truth is complicated. I don\u2019t think we can tell the whole story of the <em>McGirt</em> victory without talking about the crimes and the tragedy that it originated in. And I think the same is true for my ancestors. I was sort of raised to think one thing, but I went back through the historical records and really tried to look at it for what it was. There\u2019s a lot that we can learn from the desperation of my ancestors and their decision to sign that treaty. We can learn just how violent U.S. policy was at that time, that they would make a decision like that. There\u2019s a cultural impulse to tell stories where there are clear heroes and clear villains, and victories like <em>McGirt</em> come from a good place, and things are clean-cut. I think that history is actually quite messy. I wanted a book that reflected that reality.</p> <!-- RTT removed image (333265) --> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the aftermath of the McGirt decision, the state of Oklahoma pushed a narrative of chaos and disruption in the criminal justice system, which some national outlets then repeated without much discernment. Can you talk about the role of the media \u2014 including the lack of Indigenous representation in newsrooms \u2014 and how that shapes the public\u2019s understanding of things like tribal sovereignty?</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> I think that it\u2019s a really big hindrance to our rights as Indigenous nations and to our sovereignty. Less than a fraction of a percent of the people staffing newsrooms are Native. Coverage of Indigenous issues very often fails to meet the standards of journalism. It doesn\u2019t have context, or a depth of knowledge of what\u2019s going on. They send reporters who\u2019ve never been on a reservation to do reporting about criminal justice on tribal land. It creates an environment where you can tell lies about tribes, and people will think that it\u2019s true.</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> </blockquote> <p>And unfortunately, that\u2019s what happened.

And I think the truth is complicated. I don\u2019t think we can tell the whole story of the <em>McGirt</em> victory without talking about the crimes and the tragedy that it originated in. And I think the same is true for my ancestors. I was sort of raised to think one thing, but I went back through the historical records and really tried to look at it for what it was. There\u2019s a lot that we can learn from the desperation of my ancestors and their decision to sign that treaty. We can learn just how violent U.S. policy was at that time, that they would make a decision like that.

Smith, High Country NewsMarch 25, 2025<h1>Rebecca Nagle considers Supreme Court wins and what\u2019s at stake for tribes under Trump</h1> <p class=\"byline\">by Anna V. Smith, High Country News <br />March 25, 2025</p> <p class=\"has-drop-cap\">During the forced<strong> </strong>removal of Muscogee (Creek) people from their ancestral lands in the Southeastern U.S., tribal members carried the embers and ashes of their town fires with them, determined to re-establish the flames in the new communities they planned to build in what\u2019s now known as Oklahoma. Those fires still burn today in places on the Muscogee Reservation.</p> <div class=\"wp-block-group alignright\"> <!-- RTT removed image (333291) --> <p class=\"has-text-align-left\"><em><em>By the Fire We Carry</em> </em><br />By Rebecca Nagle<br />352 pages, hardcover: $30<br />Harper, 2024.</p> </p></div> <p>In <em>By the Fire We Carry</em>, Cherokee journalist Rebecca Nagle documents the interwoven stories of tribal land dispossession, forced removal, a murder in a small tribal community, her own family history and three recent and consequential Supreme Court decisions about tribal jurisdiction over lands in Oklahoma. Two of them, <em>Murphy v. Oklahoma</em> and <em>McGirt v. Oklahoma, </em>centered on crimes on land that the state of Oklahoma argued was no longer part of the Muscogee and Cherokee Nations\u2019 respective reservations. In both cases, the Supreme Court upheld the tribes\u2019 arguments in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. But shortly after came <em>Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta</em>, in which the Supreme Court sidestepped a century of federal Indian law and gave states jurisdiction to prosecute crimes on tribal lands when the perpetrator was non-Native and the victim was Native. The connections Nagle makes span generations and offer insight into our current political turmoil, at a time when a second Trump administration is testing the limits of executive authority and the law.</p> <p>In a conversation with <em>High Country News</em>, Nagle discusses how the U.S. still wields its power of empire, what impact the Trump administration could have on tribal sovereignty, and the enduring weight of history.</p> <p><em>This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p> <p><strong><em>High Country News</em></strong>: <strong>In this book, you don\u2019t just focus on the 20-year histories of these three Supreme Court cases but also tell the stories of the Muscogee and Cherokee nations before the U.S. existed. Why did you decide to take such a long view?</strong></p> <p><strong>Rebecca Nagle:</strong> One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present. I also wanted people to get a sense of how history repeats itself, and how things like a lie that tribal land is lawless get used over and over again, or the excuse that, \u201cOh, <em>this</em> is actually what\u2019s best for Native people.\u201d I wanted people to be able to see and identify those patterns.&nbsp;</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present.</p> </blockquote> <p>When I found out about the <em>McGirt</em> decision and saw the implications that my tribe\u2019s reservation would be recognized again, it was a really overwhelming emotion of relief, of joy, but there was also a lot of sadness, because I knew how much my ancestors, and Cherokee ancestors in general, had sacrificed to reach this moment. I think that a lot of other tribal citizens felt that the day that we were celebrating the Supreme Court decision. I think we all felt that weight of history. And I wanted the reader to feel that weight of history \u2014 to understand this isn\u2019t a simple story of, \u201cYay, the tribes won!\u201d There\u2019s a lot that\u2019s implicated in that victory and a lot that was lost for that rare legal victory to happen.</p> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the book you hold multiple difficult truths at once, like how George Jacobs\u2019 death \u2014 which caused so much pain for his community \u2014 was the origin of the Murphy case and also resulted in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. Similarly, the truth of your ancestor, John Ridge, who signed a treaty that resulted in forced removal of the Cherokee people. It was against their wishes, and also what he thought he had to do to save his nation. How did you navigate that? It can be so easy to collapse these tensions to make for a simpler narrative.&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> Absolutely. As a journalist, my North Star is the truth.

Why did you decide to take such a long view?</strong></p> <p><strong>Rebecca Nagle:</strong> One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present. I also wanted people to get a sense of how history repeats itself, and how things like a lie that tribal land is lawless get used over and over again, or the excuse that, \u201cOh, <em>this</em> is actually what\u2019s best for Native people.\u201d I wanted people to be able to see and identify those patterns.&nbsp;</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present.</p> </blockquote> <p>When I found out about the <em>McGirt</em> decision and saw the implications that my tribe\u2019s reservation would be recognized again, it was a really overwhelming emotion of relief, of joy, but there was also a lot of sadness, because I knew how much my ancestors, and Cherokee ancestors in general, had sacrificed to reach this moment. I think that a lot of other tribal citizens felt that the day that we were celebrating the Supreme Court decision. I think we all felt that weight of history. And I wanted the reader to feel that weight of history \u2014 to understand this isn\u2019t a simple story of, \u201cYay, the tribes won!\u201d There\u2019s a lot that\u2019s implicated in that victory and a lot that was lost for that rare legal victory to happen.</p> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the book you hold multiple difficult truths at once, like how George Jacobs\u2019 death \u2014 which caused so much pain for his community \u2014 was the origin of the Murphy case and also resulted in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. Similarly, the truth of your ancestor, John Ridge, who signed a treaty that resulted in forced removal of the Cherokee people. It was against their wishes, and also what he thought he had to do to save his nation. How did you navigate that? It can be so easy to collapse these tensions to make for a simpler narrative.&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> Absolutely. As a journalist, my North Star is the truth. And I think the truth is complicated. I don\u2019t think we can tell the whole story of the <em>McGirt</em> victory without talking about the crimes and the tragedy that it originated in. And I think the same is true for my ancestors. I was sort of raised to think one thing, but I went back through the historical records and really tried to look at it for what it was. There\u2019s a lot that we can learn from the desperation of my ancestors and their decision to sign that treaty. We can learn just how violent U.S. policy was at that time, that they would make a decision like that. There\u2019s a cultural impulse to tell stories where there are clear heroes and clear villains, and victories like <em>McGirt</em> come from a good place, and things are clean-cut. I think that history is actually quite messy. I wanted a book that reflected that reality.</p> <!-- RTT removed image (333265) --> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the aftermath of the McGirt decision, the state of Oklahoma pushed a narrative of chaos and disruption in the criminal justice system, which some national outlets then repeated without much discernment. Can you talk about the role of the media \u2014 including the lack of Indigenous representation in newsrooms \u2014 and how that shapes the public\u2019s understanding of things like tribal sovereignty?</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> I think that it\u2019s a really big hindrance to our rights as Indigenous nations and to our sovereignty. Less than a fraction of a percent of the people staffing newsrooms are Native. Coverage of Indigenous issues very often fails to meet the standards of journalism. It doesn\u2019t have context, or a depth of knowledge of what\u2019s going on. They send reporters who\u2019ve never been on a reservation to do reporting about criminal justice on tribal land. It creates an environment where you can tell lies about tribes, and people will think that it\u2019s true.</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> </blockquote> <p>And unfortunately, that\u2019s what happened. In the wake of <em>McGirt</em>, (Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, R) made some very bold and outlandish claims about the number of criminal cases that could be prosecuted moving forward. I did some digging around with a fellow reporter, Allison Herrera, and Oklahoma\u2019s claims fell apart completely. But they were still repeated and cited by prominent outlets like the <em>Washington Post</em> and <em>The Wall Street Journal.</em> Oklahoma then cited those articles in their briefs, and some of that inaccurate information was actually in the (<em>Castro-Huerta</em>) Supreme Court decision. And so it was this tornado of disinformation that made it all the way up to the Supreme Court. Normally, we think that the <em>Washington Post</em> is a check on bad information, but not when it comes to tribes, which should be an embarrassment for them.</p> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>We\u2019re in a moment of major law and policy change under a new administration. What are some lessons from your reporting that apply to our current moment?</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> We talk about it as a problem that originates with Trump, instead of a problem that originates with some of the flaws in our democracy. And I think the treatment of Indigenous nations is a glaring example of that, because we\u2019ve never had any kind of constitutional amendment or reform to change those laws and to change those policies. To dispossess Indigenous people of their land, the U.S. government gave itself a lot of power over people who are not U.S. citizens. That power of empire is embedded in our Constitution, because our country wanted to take Indigenous land. We still see it manifested in deportation and shutting down asylum and separating families at the border and banning Muslims from entering our country. If we really don\u2019t want these types of policies to be enacted, there are some bigger questions about our democracy that as a society we haven\u2019t even begun to ask.</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p> If we really don\u2019t want these types of policies to be enacted, there are some bigger questions about our democracy that as a society we haven\u2019t even begun to ask.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>Given that, do you have any specific concerns about potential attacks on tribal sovereignty under a second Trump administration?</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> Everything has the capacity to get worse. A lot of tribal programs, whether it\u2019s (the Indian Health Service) or tribal courts, tribal law enforcement, rely on federal dollars. There\u2019s a lot specifically at stake for tribes under Trump. The remaking of the federal judiciary has a profound impact on tribes, because our cases are federal; they don\u2019t go through state court. And, unfortunately, the courts \u2014 dating back to before Trump \u2014 have not been reliable sources for justice for tribes. Even when the law is clearly on the tribe\u2019s side, courts have a very bad habit of bending and breaking the rules to satisfy the state or non-Native residents. One of the things that\u2019s really shocked me is how often our government institutions ignore the law when it comes to tribes and how hard tribes have to fight for just the law to be followed.

Smith, High Country NewsMarch 25, 2025<h1>Rebecca Nagle considers Supreme Court wins and what\u2019s at stake for tribes under Trump</h1> <p class=\"byline\">by Anna V. Smith, High Country News <br />March 25, 2025</p> <p class=\"has-drop-cap\">During the forced<strong> </strong>removal of Muscogee (Creek) people from their ancestral lands in the Southeastern U.S., tribal members carried the embers and ashes of their town fires with them, determined to re-establish the flames in the new communities they planned to build in what\u2019s now known as Oklahoma. Those fires still burn today in places on the Muscogee Reservation.</p> <div class=\"wp-block-group alignright\"> <!-- RTT removed image (333291) --> <p class=\"has-text-align-left\"><em><em>By the Fire We Carry</em> </em><br />By Rebecca Nagle<br />352 pages, hardcover: $30<br />Harper, 2024.</p> </p></div> <p>In <em>By the Fire We Carry</em>, Cherokee journalist Rebecca Nagle documents the interwoven stories of tribal land dispossession, forced removal, a murder in a small tribal community, her own family history and three recent and consequential Supreme Court decisions about tribal jurisdiction over lands in Oklahoma. Two of them, <em>Murphy v. Oklahoma</em> and <em>McGirt v. Oklahoma, </em>centered on crimes on land that the state of Oklahoma argued was no longer part of the Muscogee and Cherokee Nations\u2019 respective reservations. In both cases, the Supreme Court upheld the tribes\u2019 arguments in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. But shortly after came <em>Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta</em>, in which the Supreme Court sidestepped a century of federal Indian law and gave states jurisdiction to prosecute crimes on tribal lands when the perpetrator was non-Native and the victim was Native. The connections Nagle makes span generations and offer insight into our current political turmoil, at a time when a second Trump administration is testing the limits of executive authority and the law.</p> <p>In a conversation with <em>High Country News</em>, Nagle discusses how the U.S. still wields its power of empire, what impact the Trump administration could have on tribal sovereignty, and the enduring weight of history.</p> <p><em>This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p> <p><strong><em>High Country News</em></strong>: <strong>In this book, you don\u2019t just focus on the 20-year histories of these three Supreme Court cases but also tell the stories of the Muscogee and Cherokee nations before the U.S. existed.

There\u2019s a lot specifically at stake for tribes under Trump. The remaking of the federal judiciary has a profound impact on tribes, because our cases are federal; they don\u2019t go through state court.

Smith, High Country NewsMarch 25, 2025<h1>Rebecca Nagle considers Supreme Court wins and what\u2019s at stake for tribes under Trump</h1> <p class=\"byline\">by Anna V. Smith, High Country News <br />March 25, 2025</p> <p class=\"has-drop-cap\">During the forced<strong> </strong>removal of Muscogee (Creek) people from their ancestral lands in the Southeastern U.S., tribal members carried the embers and ashes of their town fires with them, determined to re-establish the flames in the new communities they planned to build in what\u2019s now known as Oklahoma. Those fires still burn today in places on the Muscogee Reservation.</p> <div class=\"wp-block-group alignright\"> <!-- RTT removed image (333291) --> <p class=\"has-text-align-left\"><em><em>By the Fire We Carry</em> </em><br />By Rebecca Nagle<br />352 pages, hardcover: $30<br />Harper, 2024.</p> </p></div> <p>In <em>By the Fire We Carry</em>, Cherokee journalist Rebecca Nagle documents the interwoven stories of tribal land dispossession, forced removal, a murder in a small tribal community, her own family history and three recent and consequential Supreme Court decisions about tribal jurisdiction over lands in Oklahoma. Two of them, <em>Murphy v. Oklahoma</em> and <em>McGirt v. Oklahoma, </em>centered on crimes on land that the state of Oklahoma argued was no longer part of the Muscogee and Cherokee Nations\u2019 respective reservations. In both cases, the Supreme Court upheld the tribes\u2019 arguments in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. But shortly after came <em>Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta</em>, in which the Supreme Court sidestepped a century of federal Indian law and gave states jurisdiction to prosecute crimes on tribal lands when the perpetrator was non-Native and the victim was Native. The connections Nagle makes span generations and offer insight into our current political turmoil, at a time when a second Trump administration is testing the limits of executive authority and the law.</p> <p>In a conversation with <em>High Country News</em>, Nagle discusses how the U.S. still wields its power of empire, what impact the Trump administration could have on tribal sovereignty, and the enduring weight of history.</p> <p><em>This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p> <p><strong><em>High Country News</em></strong>: <strong>In this book, you don\u2019t just focus on the 20-year histories of these three Supreme Court cases but also tell the stories of the Muscogee and Cherokee nations before the U.S. existed. Why did you decide to take such a long view?</strong></p> <p><strong>Rebecca Nagle:</strong> One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present. I also wanted people to get a sense of how history repeats itself, and how things like a lie that tribal land is lawless get used over and over again, or the excuse that, \u201cOh, <em>this</em> is actually what\u2019s best for Native people.\u201d I wanted people to be able to see and identify those patterns.&nbsp;</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present.</p> </blockquote> <p>When I found out about the <em>McGirt</em> decision and saw the implications that my tribe\u2019s reservation would be recognized again, it was a really overwhelming emotion of relief, of joy, but there was also a lot of sadness, because I knew how much my ancestors, and Cherokee ancestors in general, had sacrificed to reach this moment. I think that a lot of other tribal citizens felt that the day that we were celebrating the Supreme Court decision. I think we all felt that weight of history. And I wanted the reader to feel that weight of history \u2014 to understand this isn\u2019t a simple story of, \u201cYay, the tribes won!\u201d There\u2019s a lot that\u2019s implicated in that victory and a lot that was lost for that rare legal victory to happen.</p> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the book you hold multiple difficult truths at once, like how George Jacobs\u2019 death \u2014 which caused so much pain for his community \u2014 was the origin of the Murphy case and also resulted in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. Similarly, the truth of your ancestor, John Ridge, who signed a treaty that resulted in forced removal of the Cherokee people. It was against their wishes, and also what he thought he had to do to save his nation. How did you navigate that? It can be so easy to collapse these tensions to make for a simpler narrative.&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> Absolutely. As a journalist, my North Star is the truth. And I think the truth is complicated. I don\u2019t think we can tell the whole story of the <em>McGirt</em> victory without talking about the crimes and the tragedy that it originated in. And I think the same is true for my ancestors. I was sort of raised to think one thing, but I went back through the historical records and really tried to look at it for what it was. There\u2019s a lot that we can learn from the desperation of my ancestors and their decision to sign that treaty. We can learn just how violent U.S. policy was at that time, that they would make a decision like that. There\u2019s a cultural impulse to tell stories where there are clear heroes and clear villains, and victories like <em>McGirt</em> come from a good place, and things are clean-cut. I think that history is actually quite messy. I wanted a book that reflected that reality.</p> <!-- RTT removed image (333265) --> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the aftermath of the McGirt decision, the state of Oklahoma pushed a narrative of chaos and disruption in the criminal justice system, which some national outlets then repeated without much discernment. Can you talk about the role of the media \u2014 including the lack of Indigenous representation in newsrooms \u2014 and how that shapes the public\u2019s understanding of things like tribal sovereignty?</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> I think that it\u2019s a really big hindrance to our rights as Indigenous nations and to our sovereignty. Less than a fraction of a percent of the people staffing newsrooms are Native. Coverage of Indigenous issues very often fails to meet the standards of journalism. It doesn\u2019t have context, or a depth of knowledge of what\u2019s going on. They send reporters who\u2019ve never been on a reservation to do reporting about criminal justice on tribal land. It creates an environment where you can tell lies about tribes, and people will think that it\u2019s true.</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> </blockquote> <p>And unfortunately, that\u2019s what happened. In the wake of <em>McGirt</em>, (Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, R) made some very bold and outlandish claims about the number of criminal cases that could be prosecuted moving forward. I did some digging around with a fellow reporter, Allison Herrera, and Oklahoma\u2019s claims fell apart completely. But they were still repeated and cited by prominent outlets like the <em>Washington Post</em> and <em>The Wall Street Journal.</em> Oklahoma then cited those articles in their briefs, and some of that inaccurate information was actually in the (<em>Castro-Huerta</em>) Supreme Court decision. And so it was this tornado of disinformation that made it all the way up to the Supreme Court. Normally, we think that the <em>Washington Post</em> is a check on bad information, but not when it comes to tribes, which should be an embarrassment for them.</p> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>We\u2019re in a moment of major law and policy change under a new administration.

Smith, High Country NewsMarch 25, 2025<h1>Rebecca Nagle considers Supreme Court wins and what\u2019s at stake for tribes under Trump</h1> <p class=\"byline\">by Anna V. Smith, High Country News <br />March 25, 2025</p> <p class=\"has-drop-cap\">During the forced<strong> </strong>removal of Muscogee (Creek) people from their ancestral lands in the Southeastern U.S., tribal members carried the embers and ashes of their town fires with them, determined to re-establish the flames in the new communities they planned to build in what\u2019s now known as Oklahoma. Those fires still burn today in places on the Muscogee Reservation.</p> <div class=\"wp-block-group alignright\"> <!-- RTT removed image (333291) --> <p class=\"has-text-align-left\"><em><em>By the Fire We Carry</em> </em><br />By Rebecca Nagle<br />352 pages, hardcover: $30<br />Harper, 2024.</p> </p></div> <p>In <em>By the Fire We Carry</em>, Cherokee journalist Rebecca Nagle documents the interwoven stories of tribal land dispossession, forced removal, a murder in a small tribal community, her own family history and three recent and consequential Supreme Court decisions about tribal jurisdiction over lands in Oklahoma. Two of them, <em>Murphy v. Oklahoma</em> and <em>McGirt v. Oklahoma, </em>centered on crimes on land that the state of Oklahoma argued was no longer part of the Muscogee and Cherokee Nations\u2019 respective reservations. In both cases, the Supreme Court upheld the tribes\u2019 arguments in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. But shortly after came <em>Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta</em>, in which the Supreme Court sidestepped a century of federal Indian law and gave states jurisdiction to prosecute crimes on tribal lands when the perpetrator was non-Native and the victim was Native. The connections Nagle makes span generations and offer insight into our current political turmoil, at a time when a second Trump administration is testing the limits of executive authority and the law.</p> <p>In a conversation with <em>High Country News</em>, Nagle discusses how the U.S. still wields its power of empire, what impact the Trump administration could have on tribal sovereignty, and the enduring weight of history.</p> <p><em>This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p> <p><strong><em>High Country News</em></strong>: <strong>In this book, you don\u2019t just focus on the 20-year histories of these three Supreme Court cases but also tell the stories of the Muscogee and Cherokee nations before the U.S. existed. Why did you decide to take such a long view?</strong></p> <p><strong>Rebecca Nagle:</strong> One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present. I also wanted people to get a sense of how history repeats itself, and how things like a lie that tribal land is lawless get used over and over again, or the excuse that, \u201cOh, <em>this</em> is actually what\u2019s best for Native people.\u201d I wanted people to be able to see and identify those patterns.&nbsp;</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present.</p> </blockquote> <p>When I found out about the <em>McGirt</em> decision and saw the implications that my tribe\u2019s reservation would be recognized again, it was a really overwhelming emotion of relief, of joy, but there was also a lot of sadness, because I knew how much my ancestors, and Cherokee ancestors in general, had sacrificed to reach this moment. I think that a lot of other tribal citizens felt that the day that we were celebrating the Supreme Court decision. I think we all felt that weight of history. And I wanted the reader to feel that weight of history \u2014 to understand this isn\u2019t a simple story of, \u201cYay, the tribes won!\u201d There\u2019s a lot that\u2019s implicated in that victory and a lot that was lost for that rare legal victory to happen.</p> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the book you hold multiple difficult truths at once, like how George Jacobs\u2019 death \u2014 which caused so much pain for his community \u2014 was the origin of the Murphy case and also resulted in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. Similarly, the truth of your ancestor, John Ridge, who signed a treaty that resulted in forced removal of the Cherokee people. It was against their wishes, and also what he thought he had to do to save his nation. How did you navigate that? It can be so easy to collapse these tensions to make for a simpler narrative.&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> Absolutely. As a journalist, my North Star is the truth. And I think the truth is complicated. I don\u2019t think we can tell the whole story of the <em>McGirt</em> victory without talking about the crimes and the tragedy that it originated in. And I think the same is true for my ancestors. I was sort of raised to think one thing, but I went back through the historical records and really tried to look at it for what it was. There\u2019s a lot that we can learn from the desperation of my ancestors and their decision to sign that treaty. We can learn just how violent U.S. policy was at that time, that they would make a decision like that. There\u2019s a cultural impulse to tell stories where there are clear heroes and clear villains, and victories like <em>McGirt</em> come from a good place, and things are clean-cut. I think that history is actually quite messy.

Smith, High Country NewsMarch 25, 2025<h1>Rebecca Nagle considers Supreme Court wins and what\u2019s at stake for tribes under Trump</h1> <p class=\"byline\">by Anna V. Smith, High Country News <br />March 25, 2025</p> <p class=\"has-drop-cap\">During the forced<strong> </strong>removal of Muscogee (Creek) people from their ancestral lands in the Southeastern U.S., tribal members carried the embers and ashes of their town fires with them, determined to re-establish the flames in the new communities they planned to build in what\u2019s now known as Oklahoma. Those fires still burn today in places on the Muscogee Reservation.</p> <div class=\"wp-block-group alignright\"> <!-- RTT removed image (333291) --> <p class=\"has-text-align-left\"><em><em>By the Fire We Carry</em> </em><br />By Rebecca Nagle<br />352 pages, hardcover: $30<br />Harper, 2024.</p> </p></div> <p>In <em>By the Fire We Carry</em>, Cherokee journalist Rebecca Nagle documents the interwoven stories of tribal land dispossession, forced removal, a murder in a small tribal community, her own family history and three recent and consequential Supreme Court decisions about tribal jurisdiction over lands in Oklahoma. Two of them, <em>Murphy v. Oklahoma</em> and <em>McGirt v. Oklahoma, </em>centered on crimes on land that the state of Oklahoma argued was no longer part of the Muscogee and Cherokee Nations\u2019 respective reservations. In both cases, the Supreme Court upheld the tribes\u2019 arguments in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. But shortly after came <em>Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta</em>, in which the Supreme Court sidestepped a century of federal Indian law and gave states jurisdiction to prosecute crimes on tribal lands when the perpetrator was non-Native and the victim was Native. The connections Nagle makes span generations and offer insight into our current political turmoil, at a time when a second Trump administration is testing the limits of executive authority and the law.</p> <p>In a conversation with <em>High Country News</em>, Nagle discusses how the U.S. still wields its power of empire, what impact the Trump administration could have on tribal sovereignty, and the enduring weight of history.</p> <p><em>This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p> <p><strong><em>High Country News</em></strong>: <strong>In this book, you don\u2019t just focus on the 20-year histories of these three Supreme Court cases but also tell the stories of the Muscogee and Cherokee nations before the U.S. existed. Why did you decide to take such a long view?</strong></p> <p><strong>Rebecca Nagle:</strong> One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present. I also wanted people to get a sense of how history repeats itself, and how things like a lie that tribal land is lawless get used over and over again, or the excuse that, \u201cOh, <em>this</em> is actually what\u2019s best for Native people.\u201d I wanted people to be able to see and identify those patterns.&nbsp;</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present.</p> </blockquote> <p>When I found out about the <em>McGirt</em> decision and saw the implications that my tribe\u2019s reservation would be recognized again, it was a really overwhelming emotion of relief, of joy, but there was also a lot of sadness, because I knew how much my ancestors, and Cherokee ancestors in general, had sacrificed to reach this moment. I think that a lot of other tribal citizens felt that the day that we were celebrating the Supreme Court decision. I think we all felt that weight of history. And I wanted the reader to feel that weight of history \u2014 to understand this isn\u2019t a simple story of, \u201cYay, the tribes won!\u201d There\u2019s a lot that\u2019s implicated in that victory and a lot that was lost for that rare legal victory to happen.</p> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the book you hold multiple difficult truths at once, like how George Jacobs\u2019 death \u2014 which caused so much pain for his community \u2014 was the origin of the Murphy case and also resulted in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. Similarly, the truth of your ancestor, John Ridge, who signed a treaty that resulted in forced removal of the Cherokee people. It was against their wishes, and also what he thought he had to do to save his nation. How did you navigate that? It can be so easy to collapse these tensions to make for a simpler narrative.&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> Absolutely. As a journalist, my North Star is the truth. And I think the truth is complicated. I don\u2019t think we can tell the whole story of the <em>McGirt</em> victory without talking about the crimes and the tragedy that it originated in. And I think the same is true for my ancestors. I was sort of raised to think one thing, but I went back through the historical records and really tried to look at it for what it was. There\u2019s a lot that we can learn from the desperation of my ancestors and their decision to sign that treaty. We can learn just how violent U.S. policy was at that time, that they would make a decision like that. There\u2019s a cultural impulse to tell stories where there are clear heroes and clear villains, and victories like <em>McGirt</em> come from a good place, and things are clean-cut. I think that history is actually quite messy. I wanted a book that reflected that reality.</p> <!-- RTT removed image (333265) --> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the aftermath of the McGirt decision, the state of Oklahoma pushed a narrative of chaos and disruption in the criminal justice system, which some national outlets then repeated without much discernment.

Oklahoma, </em>centered on crimes on land that the state of Oklahoma argued was no longer part of the Muscogee and Cherokee Nations\u2019 respective reservations. In both cases, the Supreme Court upheld the tribes\u2019 arguments in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. But shortly after came <em>Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta</em>, in which the Supreme Court sidestepped a century of federal Indian law and gave states jurisdiction to prosecute crimes on tribal lands when the perpetrator was non-Native and the victim was Native. The connections Nagle makes span generations and offer insight into our current political turmoil, at a time when a second Trump administration is testing the limits of executive authority and the law.</p> <p>In a conversation with <em>High Country News</em>, Nagle discusses how the U.S. still wields its power of empire, what impact the Trump administration could have on tribal sovereignty, and the enduring weight of history.</p> <p><em>This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p> <p><strong><em>High Country News</em></strong>: <strong>In this book, you don\u2019t just focus on the 20-year histories of these three Supreme Court cases but also tell the stories of the Muscogee and Cherokee nations before the U.S. existed. Why did you decide to take such a long view?</strong></p> <p><strong>Rebecca Nagle:</strong> One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present. I also wanted people to get a sense of how history repeats itself, and how things like a lie that tribal land is lawless get used over and over again, or the excuse that, \u201cOh, <em>this</em> is actually what\u2019s best for Native people.\u201d I wanted people to be able to see and identify those patterns.&nbsp;</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present.</p> </blockquote> <p>When I found out about the <em>McGirt</em> decision and saw the implications that my tribe\u2019s reservation would be recognized again, it was a really overwhelming emotion of relief, of joy, but there was also a lot of sadness, because I knew how much my ancestors, and Cherokee ancestors in general, had sacrificed to reach this moment. I think that a lot of other tribal citizens felt that the day that we were celebrating the Supreme Court decision. I think we all felt that weight of history. And I wanted the reader to feel that weight of history \u2014 to understand this isn\u2019t a simple story of, \u201cYay, the tribes won!\u201d There\u2019s a lot that\u2019s implicated in that victory and a lot that was lost for that rare legal victory to happen.</p> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the book you hold multiple difficult truths at once, like how George Jacobs\u2019 death \u2014 which caused so much pain for his community \u2014 was the origin of the Murphy case and also resulted in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. Similarly, the truth of your ancestor, John Ridge, who signed a treaty that resulted in forced removal of the Cherokee people. It was against their wishes, and also what he thought he had to do to save his nation. How did you navigate that? It can be so easy to collapse these tensions to make for a simpler narrative.&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> Absolutely. As a journalist, my North Star is the truth. And I think the truth is complicated. I don\u2019t think we can tell the whole story of the <em>McGirt</em> victory without talking about the crimes and the tragedy that it originated in. And I think the same is true for my ancestors. I was sort of raised to think one thing, but I went back through the historical records and really tried to look at it for what it was. There\u2019s a lot that we can learn from the desperation of my ancestors and their decision to sign that treaty. We can learn just how violent U.S. policy was at that time, that they would make a decision like that. There\u2019s a cultural impulse to tell stories where there are clear heroes and clear villains, and victories like <em>McGirt</em> come from a good place, and things are clean-cut. I think that history is actually quite messy. I wanted a book that reflected that reality.</p> <!-- RTT removed image (333265) --> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the aftermath of the McGirt decision, the state of Oklahoma pushed a narrative of chaos and disruption in the criminal justice system, which some national outlets then repeated without much discernment. Can you talk about the role of the media \u2014 including the lack of Indigenous representation in newsrooms \u2014 and how that shapes the public\u2019s understanding of things like tribal sovereignty?</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> I think that it\u2019s a really big hindrance to our rights as Indigenous nations and to our sovereignty. Less than a fraction of a percent of the people staffing newsrooms are Native. Coverage of Indigenous issues very often fails to meet the standards of journalism. It doesn\u2019t have context, or a depth of knowledge of what\u2019s going on. They send reporters who\u2019ve never been on a reservation to do reporting about criminal justice on tribal land. It creates an environment where you can tell lies about tribes, and people will think that it\u2019s true.</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> </blockquote> <p>And unfortunately, that\u2019s what happened. In the wake of <em>McGirt</em>, (Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, R) made some very bold and outlandish claims about the number of criminal cases that could be prosecuted moving forward. I did some digging around with a fellow reporter, Allison Herrera, and Oklahoma\u2019s claims fell apart completely. But they were still repeated and cited by prominent outlets like the <em>Washington Post</em> and <em>The Wall Street Journal.</em> Oklahoma then cited those articles in their briefs, and some of that inaccurate information was actually in the (<em>Castro-Huerta</em>) Supreme Court decision. And so it was this tornado of disinformation that made it all the way up to the Supreme Court.

And I think the treatment of Indigenous nations is a glaring example of that, because we\u2019ve never had any kind of constitutional amendment or reform to change those laws and to change those policies. To dispossess Indigenous people of their land, the U.S. government gave itself a lot of power over people who are not U.S. citizens. That power of empire is embedded in our Constitution, because our country wanted to take Indigenous land. We still see it manifested in deportation and shutting down asylum and separating families at the border and banning Muslims from entering our country.

Smith, High Country NewsMarch 25, 2025<h1>Rebecca Nagle considers Supreme Court wins and what\u2019s at stake for tribes under Trump</h1> <p class=\"byline\">by Anna V. Smith, High Country News <br />March 25, 2025</p> <p class=\"has-drop-cap\">During the forced<strong> </strong>removal of Muscogee (Creek) people from their ancestral lands in the Southeastern U.S., tribal members carried the embers and ashes of their town fires with them, determined to re-establish the flames in the new communities they planned to build in what\u2019s now known as Oklahoma. Those fires still burn today in places on the Muscogee Reservation.</p> <div class=\"wp-block-group alignright\"> <!-- RTT removed image (333291) --> <p class=\"has-text-align-left\"><em><em>By the Fire We Carry</em> </em><br />By Rebecca Nagle<br />352 pages, hardcover: $30<br />Harper, 2024.</p> </p></div> <p>In <em>By the Fire We Carry</em>, Cherokee journalist Rebecca Nagle documents the interwoven stories of tribal land dispossession, forced removal, a murder in a small tribal community, her own family history and three recent and consequential Supreme Court decisions about tribal jurisdiction over lands in Oklahoma. Two of them, <em>Murphy v. Oklahoma</em> and <em>McGirt v. Oklahoma, </em>centered on crimes on land that the state of Oklahoma argued was no longer part of the Muscogee and Cherokee Nations\u2019 respective reservations. In both cases, the Supreme Court upheld the tribes\u2019 arguments in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. But shortly after came <em>Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta</em>, in which the Supreme Court sidestepped a century of federal Indian law and gave states jurisdiction to prosecute crimes on tribal lands when the perpetrator was non-Native and the victim was Native. The connections Nagle makes span generations and offer insight into our current political turmoil, at a time when a second Trump administration is testing the limits of executive authority and the law.</p> <p>In a conversation with <em>High Country News</em>, Nagle discusses how the U.S. still wields its power of empire, what impact the Trump administration could have on tribal sovereignty, and the enduring weight of history.</p> <p><em>This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p> <p><strong><em>High Country News</em></strong>: <strong>In this book, you don\u2019t just focus on the 20-year histories of these three Supreme Court cases but also tell the stories of the Muscogee and Cherokee nations before the U.S. existed. Why did you decide to take such a long view?</strong></p> <p><strong>Rebecca Nagle:</strong> One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present. I also wanted people to get a sense of how history repeats itself, and how things like a lie that tribal land is lawless get used over and over again, or the excuse that, \u201cOh, <em>this</em> is actually what\u2019s best for Native people.\u201d I wanted people to be able to see and identify those patterns.&nbsp;</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present.</p> </blockquote> <p>When I found out about the <em>McGirt</em> decision and saw the implications that my tribe\u2019s reservation would be recognized again, it was a really overwhelming emotion of relief, of joy, but there was also a lot of sadness, because I knew how much my ancestors, and Cherokee ancestors in general, had sacrificed to reach this moment. I think that a lot of other tribal citizens felt that the day that we were celebrating the Supreme Court decision. I think we all felt that weight of history. And I wanted the reader to feel that weight of history \u2014 to understand this isn\u2019t a simple story of, \u201cYay, the tribes won!\u201d There\u2019s a lot that\u2019s implicated in that victory and a lot that was lost for that rare legal victory to happen.</p> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the book you hold multiple difficult truths at once, like how George Jacobs\u2019 death \u2014 which caused so much pain for his community \u2014 was the origin of the Murphy case and also resulted in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. Similarly, the truth of your ancestor, John Ridge, who signed a treaty that resulted in forced removal of the Cherokee people. It was against their wishes, and also what he thought he had to do to save his nation. How did you navigate that? It can be so easy to collapse these tensions to make for a simpler narrative.&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> Absolutely. As a journalist, my North Star is the truth. And I think the truth is complicated. I don\u2019t think we can tell the whole story of the <em>McGirt</em> victory without talking about the crimes and the tragedy that it originated in. And I think the same is true for my ancestors. I was sort of raised to think one thing, but I went back through the historical records and really tried to look at it for what it was. There\u2019s a lot that we can learn from the desperation of my ancestors and their decision to sign that treaty. We can learn just how violent U.S. policy was at that time, that they would make a decision like that. There\u2019s a cultural impulse to tell stories where there are clear heroes and clear villains, and victories like <em>McGirt</em> come from a good place, and things are clean-cut. I think that history is actually quite messy. I wanted a book that reflected that reality.</p> <!-- RTT removed image (333265) --> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the aftermath of the McGirt decision, the state of Oklahoma pushed a narrative of chaos and disruption in the criminal justice system, which some national outlets then repeated without much discernment. Can you talk about the role of the media \u2014 including the lack of Indigenous representation in newsrooms \u2014 and how that shapes the public\u2019s understanding of things like tribal sovereignty?</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> I think that it\u2019s a really big hindrance to our rights as Indigenous nations and to our sovereignty. Less than a fraction of a percent of the people staffing newsrooms are Native. Coverage of Indigenous issues very often fails to meet the standards of journalism. It doesn\u2019t have context, or a depth of knowledge of what\u2019s going on. They send reporters who\u2019ve never been on a reservation to do reporting about criminal justice on tribal land. It creates an environment where you can tell lies about tribes, and people will think that it\u2019s true.</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> </blockquote> <p>And unfortunately, that\u2019s what happened. In the wake of <em>McGirt</em>, (Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, R) made some very bold and outlandish claims about the number of criminal cases that could be prosecuted moving forward. I did some digging around with a fellow reporter, Allison Herrera, and Oklahoma\u2019s claims fell apart completely. But they were still repeated and cited by prominent outlets like the <em>Washington Post</em> and <em>The Wall Street Journal.</em> Oklahoma then cited those articles in their briefs, and some of that inaccurate information was actually in the (<em>Castro-Huerta</em>) Supreme Court decision. And so it was this tornado of disinformation that made it all the way up to the Supreme Court. Normally, we think that the <em>Washington Post</em> is a check on bad information, but not when it comes to tribes, which should be an embarrassment for them.</p> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>We\u2019re in a moment of major law and policy change under a new administration. What are some lessons from your reporting that apply to our current moment?</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> We talk about it as a problem that originates with Trump, instead of a problem that originates with some of the flaws in our democracy. And I think the treatment of Indigenous nations is a glaring example of that, because we\u2019ve never had any kind of constitutional amendment or reform to change those laws and to change those policies. To dispossess Indigenous people of their land, the U.S. government gave itself a lot of power over people who are not U.S. citizens. That power of empire is embedded in our Constitution, because our country wanted to take Indigenous land. We still see it manifested in deportation and shutting down asylum and separating families at the border and banning Muslims from entering our country. If we really don\u2019t want these types of policies to be enacted, there are some bigger questions about our democracy that as a society we haven\u2019t even begun to ask.</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p> If we really don\u2019t want these types of policies to be enacted, there are some bigger questions about our democracy that as a society we haven\u2019t even begun to ask.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>Given that, do you have any specific concerns about potential attacks on tribal sovereignty under a second Trump administration?</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> Everything has the capacity to get worse. A lot of tribal programs, whether it\u2019s (the Indian Health Service) or tribal courts, tribal law enforcement, rely on federal dollars. There\u2019s a lot specifically at stake for tribes under Trump. The remaking of the federal judiciary has a profound impact on tribes, because our cases are federal; they don\u2019t go through state court. And, unfortunately, the courts \u2014 dating back to before Trump \u2014 have not been reliable sources for justice for tribes. Even when the law is clearly on the tribe\u2019s side, courts have a very bad habit of bending and breaking the rules to satisfy the state or non-Native residents. One of the things that\u2019s really shocked me is how often our government institutions ignore the law when it comes to tribes and how hard tribes have to fight for just the law to be followed. Those weaknesses in our democracy have been there for a long time.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p> <p><em>We welcome reader letters.

Smith, High Country NewsMarch 25, 2025<h1>Rebecca Nagle considers Supreme Court wins and what\u2019s at stake for tribes under Trump</h1> <p class=\"byline\">by Anna V. Smith, High Country News <br />March 25, 2025</p> <p class=\"has-drop-cap\">During the forced<strong> </strong>removal of Muscogee (Creek) people from their ancestral lands in the Southeastern U.S., tribal members carried the embers and ashes of their town fires with them, determined to re-establish the flames in the new communities they planned to build in what\u2019s now known as Oklahoma. Those fires still burn today in places on the Muscogee Reservation.</p> <div class=\"wp-block-group alignright\"> <!-- RTT removed image (333291) --> <p class=\"has-text-align-left\"><em><em>By the Fire We Carry</em> </em><br />By Rebecca Nagle<br />352 pages, hardcover: $30<br />Harper, 2024.</p> </p></div> <p>In <em>By the Fire We Carry</em>, Cherokee journalist Rebecca Nagle documents the interwoven stories of tribal land dispossession, forced removal, a murder in a small tribal community, her own family history and three recent and consequential Supreme Court decisions about tribal jurisdiction over lands in Oklahoma. Two of them, <em>Murphy v. Oklahoma</em> and <em>McGirt v. Oklahoma, </em>centered on crimes on land that the state of Oklahoma argued was no longer part of the Muscogee and Cherokee Nations\u2019 respective reservations. In both cases, the Supreme Court upheld the tribes\u2019 arguments in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. But shortly after came <em>Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta</em>, in which the Supreme Court sidestepped a century of federal Indian law and gave states jurisdiction to prosecute crimes on tribal lands when the perpetrator was non-Native and the victim was Native. The connections Nagle makes span generations and offer insight into our current political turmoil, at a time when a second Trump administration is testing the limits of executive authority and the law.</p> <p>In a conversation with <em>High Country News</em>, Nagle discusses how the U.S. still wields its power of empire, what impact the Trump administration could have on tribal sovereignty, and the enduring weight of history.</p> <p><em>This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p> <p><strong><em>High Country News</em></strong>: <strong>In this book, you don\u2019t just focus on the 20-year histories of these three Supreme Court cases but also tell the stories of the Muscogee and Cherokee nations before the U.S. existed. Why did you decide to take such a long view?</strong></p> <p><strong>Rebecca Nagle:</strong> One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present. I also wanted people to get a sense of how history repeats itself, and how things like a lie that tribal land is lawless get used over and over again, or the excuse that, \u201cOh, <em>this</em> is actually what\u2019s best for Native people.\u201d I wanted people to be able to see and identify those patterns.&nbsp;</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present.</p> </blockquote> <p>When I found out about the <em>McGirt</em> decision and saw the implications that my tribe\u2019s reservation would be recognized again, it was a really overwhelming emotion of relief, of joy, but there was also a lot of sadness, because I knew how much my ancestors, and Cherokee ancestors in general, had sacrificed to reach this moment. I think that a lot of other tribal citizens felt that the day that we were celebrating the Supreme Court decision. I think we all felt that weight of history. And I wanted the reader to feel that weight of history \u2014 to understand this isn\u2019t a simple story of, \u201cYay, the tribes won!\u201d There\u2019s a lot that\u2019s implicated in that victory and a lot that was lost for that rare legal victory to happen.</p> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the book you hold multiple difficult truths at once, like how George Jacobs\u2019 death \u2014 which caused so much pain for his community \u2014 was the origin of the Murphy case and also resulted in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. Similarly, the truth of your ancestor, John Ridge, who signed a treaty that resulted in forced removal of the Cherokee people. It was against their wishes, and also what he thought he had to do to save his nation. How did you navigate that? It can be so easy to collapse these tensions to make for a simpler narrative.&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> Absolutely. As a journalist, my North Star is the truth. And I think the truth is complicated. I don\u2019t think we can tell the whole story of the <em>McGirt</em> victory without talking about the crimes and the tragedy that it originated in. And I think the same is true for my ancestors. I was sort of raised to think one thing, but I went back through the historical records and really tried to look at it for what it was. There\u2019s a lot that we can learn from the desperation of my ancestors and their decision to sign that treaty. We can learn just how violent U.S. policy was at that time, that they would make a decision like that. There\u2019s a cultural impulse to tell stories where there are clear heroes and clear villains, and victories like <em>McGirt</em> come from a good place, and things are clean-cut. I think that history is actually quite messy. I wanted a book that reflected that reality.</p> <!-- RTT removed image (333265) --> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the aftermath of the McGirt decision, the state of Oklahoma pushed a narrative of chaos and disruption in the criminal justice system, which some national outlets then repeated without much discernment. Can you talk about the role of the media \u2014 including the lack of Indigenous representation in newsrooms \u2014 and how that shapes the public\u2019s understanding of things like tribal sovereignty?</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> I think that it\u2019s a really big hindrance to our rights as Indigenous nations and to our sovereignty. Less than a fraction of a percent of the people staffing newsrooms are Native. Coverage of Indigenous issues very often fails to meet the standards of journalism. It doesn\u2019t have context, or a depth of knowledge of what\u2019s going on. They send reporters who\u2019ve never been on a reservation to do reporting about criminal justice on tribal land. It creates an environment where you can tell lies about tribes, and people will think that it\u2019s true.</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> </blockquote> <p>And unfortunately, that\u2019s what happened. In the wake of <em>McGirt</em>, (Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, R) made some very bold and outlandish claims about the number of criminal cases that could be prosecuted moving forward. I did some digging around with a fellow reporter, Allison Herrera, and Oklahoma\u2019s claims fell apart completely. But they were still repeated and cited by prominent outlets like the <em>Washington Post</em> and <em>The Wall Street Journal.</em> Oklahoma then cited those articles in their briefs, and some of that inaccurate information was actually in the (<em>Castro-Huerta</em>) Supreme Court decision. And so it was this tornado of disinformation that made it all the way up to the Supreme Court. Normally, we think that the <em>Washington Post</em> is a check on bad information, but not when it comes to tribes, which should be an embarrassment for them.</p> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>We\u2019re in a moment of major law and policy change under a new administration. What are some lessons from your reporting that apply to our current moment?</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> We talk about it as a problem that originates with Trump, instead of a problem that originates with some of the flaws in our democracy. And I think the treatment of Indigenous nations is a glaring example of that, because we\u2019ve never had any kind of constitutional amendment or reform to change those laws and to change those policies. To dispossess Indigenous people of their land, the U.S. government gave itself a lot of power over people who are not U.S. citizens. That power of empire is embedded in our Constitution, because our country wanted to take Indigenous land. We still see it manifested in deportation and shutting down asylum and separating families at the border and banning Muslims from entering our country. If we really don\u2019t want these types of policies to be enacted, there are some bigger questions about our democracy that as a society we haven\u2019t even begun to ask.</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p> If we really don\u2019t want these types of policies to be enacted, there are some bigger questions about our democracy that as a society we haven\u2019t even begun to ask.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>Given that, do you have any specific concerns about potential attacks on tribal sovereignty under a second Trump administration?</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> Everything has the capacity to get worse.

Smith, High Country NewsMarch 25, 2025<h1>Rebecca Nagle considers Supreme Court wins and what\u2019s at stake for tribes under Trump</h1> <p class=\"byline\">by Anna V. Smith, High Country News <br />March 25, 2025</p> <p class=\"has-drop-cap\">During the forced<strong> </strong>removal of Muscogee (Creek) people from their ancestral lands in the Southeastern U.S., tribal members carried the embers and ashes of their town fires with them, determined to re-establish the flames in the new communities they planned to build in what\u2019s now known as Oklahoma. Those fires still burn today in places on the Muscogee Reservation.</p> <div class=\"wp-block-group alignright\"> <!-- RTT removed image (333291) --> <p class=\"has-text-align-left\"><em><em>By the Fire We Carry</em> </em><br />By Rebecca Nagle<br />352 pages, hardcover: $30<br />Harper, 2024.</p> </p></div> <p>In <em>By the Fire We Carry</em>, Cherokee journalist Rebecca Nagle documents the interwoven stories of tribal land dispossession, forced removal, a murder in a small tribal community, her own family history and three recent and consequential Supreme Court decisions about tribal jurisdiction over lands in Oklahoma. Two of them, <em>Murphy v. Oklahoma</em> and <em>McGirt v. Oklahoma, </em>centered on crimes on land that the state of Oklahoma argued was no longer part of the Muscogee and Cherokee Nations\u2019 respective reservations. In both cases, the Supreme Court upheld the tribes\u2019 arguments in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. But shortly after came <em>Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta</em>, in which the Supreme Court sidestepped a century of federal Indian law and gave states jurisdiction to prosecute crimes on tribal lands when the perpetrator was non-Native and the victim was Native. The connections Nagle makes span generations and offer insight into our current political turmoil, at a time when a second Trump administration is testing the limits of executive authority and the law.</p> <p>In a conversation with <em>High Country News</em>, Nagle discusses how the U.S. still wields its power of empire, what impact the Trump administration could have on tribal sovereignty, and the enduring weight of history.</p> <p><em>This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p> <p><strong><em>High Country News</em></strong>: <strong>In this book, you don\u2019t just focus on the 20-year histories of these three Supreme Court cases but also tell the stories of the Muscogee and Cherokee nations before the U.S. existed. Why did you decide to take such a long view?</strong></p> <p><strong>Rebecca Nagle:</strong> One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present. I also wanted people to get a sense of how history repeats itself, and how things like a lie that tribal land is lawless get used over and over again, or the excuse that, \u201cOh, <em>this</em> is actually what\u2019s best for Native people.\u201d I wanted people to be able to see and identify those patterns.&nbsp;</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present.</p> </blockquote> <p>When I found out about the <em>McGirt</em> decision and saw the implications that my tribe\u2019s reservation would be recognized again, it was a really overwhelming emotion of relief, of joy, but there was also a lot of sadness, because I knew how much my ancestors, and Cherokee ancestors in general, had sacrificed to reach this moment. I think that a lot of other tribal citizens felt that the day that we were celebrating the Supreme Court decision. I think we all felt that weight of history. And I wanted the reader to feel that weight of history \u2014 to understand this isn\u2019t a simple story of, \u201cYay, the tribes won!\u201d There\u2019s a lot that\u2019s implicated in that victory and a lot that was lost for that rare legal victory to happen.</p> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the book you hold multiple difficult truths at once, like how George Jacobs\u2019 death \u2014 which caused so much pain for his community \u2014 was the origin of the Murphy case and also resulted in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. Similarly, the truth of your ancestor, John Ridge, who signed a treaty that resulted in forced removal of the Cherokee people. It was against their wishes, and also what he thought he had to do to save his nation. How did you navigate that? It can be so easy to collapse these tensions to make for a simpler narrative.&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> Absolutely. As a journalist, my North Star is the truth. And I think the truth is complicated. I don\u2019t think we can tell the whole story of the <em>McGirt</em> victory without talking about the crimes and the tragedy that it originated in. And I think the same is true for my ancestors. I was sort of raised to think one thing, but I went back through the historical records and really tried to look at it for what it was. There\u2019s a lot that we can learn from the desperation of my ancestors and their decision to sign that treaty. We can learn just how violent U.S. policy was at that time, that they would make a decision like that. There\u2019s a cultural impulse to tell stories where there are clear heroes and clear villains, and victories like <em>McGirt</em> come from a good place, and things are clean-cut. I think that history is actually quite messy. I wanted a book that reflected that reality.</p> <!-- RTT removed image (333265) --> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the aftermath of the McGirt decision, the state of Oklahoma pushed a narrative of chaos and disruption in the criminal justice system, which some national outlets then repeated without much discernment. Can you talk about the role of the media \u2014 including the lack of Indigenous representation in newsrooms \u2014 and how that shapes the public\u2019s understanding of things like tribal sovereignty?</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> I think that it\u2019s a really big hindrance to our rights as Indigenous nations and to our sovereignty. Less than a fraction of a percent of the people staffing newsrooms are Native. Coverage of Indigenous issues very often fails to meet the standards of journalism. It doesn\u2019t have context, or a depth of knowledge of what\u2019s going on. They send reporters who\u2019ve never been on a reservation to do reporting about criminal justice on tribal land. It creates an environment where you can tell lies about tribes, and people will think that it\u2019s true.</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> </blockquote> <p>And unfortunately, that\u2019s what happened. In the wake of <em>McGirt</em>, (Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, R) made some very bold and outlandish claims about the number of criminal cases that could be prosecuted moving forward. I did some digging around with a fellow reporter, Allison Herrera, and Oklahoma\u2019s claims fell apart completely. But they were still repeated and cited by prominent outlets like the <em>Washington Post</em> and <em>The Wall Street Journal.</em> Oklahoma then cited those articles in their briefs, and some of that inaccurate information was actually in the (<em>Castro-Huerta</em>) Supreme Court decision. And so it was this tornado of disinformation that made it all the way up to the Supreme Court. Normally, we think that the <em>Washington Post</em> is a check on bad information, but not when it comes to tribes, which should be an embarrassment for them.</p> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>We\u2019re in a moment of major law and policy change under a new administration. What are some lessons from your reporting that apply to our current moment?</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> We talk about it as a problem that originates with Trump, instead of a problem that originates with some of the flaws in our democracy. And I think the treatment of Indigenous nations is a glaring example of that, because we\u2019ve never had any kind of constitutional amendment or reform to change those laws and to change those policies. To dispossess Indigenous people of their land, the U.S. government gave itself a lot of power over people who are not U.S. citizens. That power of empire is embedded in our Constitution, because our country wanted to take Indigenous land. We still see it manifested in deportation and shutting down asylum and separating families at the border and banning Muslims from entering our country. If we really don\u2019t want these types of policies to be enacted, there are some bigger questions about our democracy that as a society we haven\u2019t even begun to ask.</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p> If we really don\u2019t want these types of policies to be enacted, there are some bigger questions about our democracy that as a society we haven\u2019t even begun to ask.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>Given that, do you have any specific concerns about potential attacks on tribal sovereignty under a second Trump administration?</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> Everything has the capacity to get worse.

Smith, High Country NewsMarch 25, 2025<h1>Rebecca Nagle considers Supreme Court wins and what\u2019s at stake for tribes under Trump</h1> <p class=\"byline\">by Anna V. Smith, High Country News <br />March 25, 2025</p> <p class=\"has-drop-cap\">During the forced<strong> </strong>removal of Muscogee (Creek) people from their ancestral lands in the Southeastern U.S., tribal members carried the embers and ashes of their town fires with them, determined to re-establish the flames in the new communities they planned to build in what\u2019s now known as Oklahoma. Those fires still burn today in places on the Muscogee Reservation.</p> <div class=\"wp-block-group alignright\"> <!-- RTT removed image (333291) --> <p class=\"has-text-align-left\"><em><em>By the Fire We Carry</em> </em><br />By Rebecca Nagle<br />352 pages, hardcover: $30<br />Harper, 2024.</p> </p></div> <p>In <em>By the Fire We Carry</em>, Cherokee journalist Rebecca Nagle documents the interwoven stories of tribal land dispossession, forced removal, a murder in a small tribal community, her own family history and three recent and consequential Supreme Court decisions about tribal jurisdiction over lands in Oklahoma. Two of them, <em>Murphy v. Oklahoma</em> and <em>McGirt v. Oklahoma, </em>centered on crimes on land that the state of Oklahoma argued was no longer part of the Muscogee and Cherokee Nations\u2019 respective reservations. In both cases, the Supreme Court upheld the tribes\u2019 arguments in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. But shortly after came <em>Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta</em>, in which the Supreme Court sidestepped a century of federal Indian law and gave states jurisdiction to prosecute crimes on tribal lands when the perpetrator was non-Native and the victim was Native. The connections Nagle makes span generations and offer insight into our current political turmoil, at a time when a second Trump administration is testing the limits of executive authority and the law.</p> <p>In a conversation with <em>High Country News</em>, Nagle discusses how the U.S. still wields its power of empire, what impact the Trump administration could have on tribal sovereignty, and the enduring weight of history.</p> <p><em>This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p> <p><strong><em>High Country News</em></strong>: <strong>In this book, you don\u2019t just focus on the 20-year histories of these three Supreme Court cases but also tell the stories of the Muscogee and Cherokee nations before the U.S. existed. Why did you decide to take such a long view?</strong></p> <p><strong>Rebecca Nagle:</strong> One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present. I also wanted people to get a sense of how history repeats itself, and how things like a lie that tribal land is lawless get used over and over again, or the excuse that, \u201cOh, <em>this</em> is actually what\u2019s best for Native people.\u201d I wanted people to be able to see and identify those patterns.&nbsp;</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present.</p> </blockquote> <p>When I found out about the <em>McGirt</em> decision and saw the implications that my tribe\u2019s reservation would be recognized again, it was a really overwhelming emotion of relief, of joy, but there was also a lot of sadness, because I knew how much my ancestors, and Cherokee ancestors in general, had sacrificed to reach this moment. I think that a lot of other tribal citizens felt that the day that we were celebrating the Supreme Court decision. I think we all felt that weight of history. And I wanted the reader to feel that weight of history \u2014 to understand this isn\u2019t a simple story of, \u201cYay, the tribes won!\u201d There\u2019s a lot that\u2019s implicated in that victory and a lot that was lost for that rare legal victory to happen.</p> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the book you hold multiple difficult truths at once, like how George Jacobs\u2019 death \u2014 which caused so much pain for his community \u2014 was the origin of the Murphy case and also resulted in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. Similarly, the truth of your ancestor, John Ridge, who signed a treaty that resulted in forced removal of the Cherokee people. It was against their wishes, and also what he thought he had to do to save his nation. How did you navigate that? It can be so easy to collapse these tensions to make for a simpler narrative.&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> Absolutely. As a journalist, my North Star is the truth. And I think the truth is complicated. I don\u2019t think we can tell the whole story of the <em>McGirt</em> victory without talking about the crimes and the tragedy that it originated in. And I think the same is true for my ancestors. I was sort of raised to think one thing, but I went back through the historical records and really tried to look at it for what it was. There\u2019s a lot that we can learn from the desperation of my ancestors and their decision to sign that treaty. We can learn just how violent U.S. policy was at that time, that they would make a decision like that. There\u2019s a cultural impulse to tell stories where there are clear heroes and clear villains, and victories like <em>McGirt</em> come from a good place, and things are clean-cut. I think that history is actually quite messy. I wanted a book that reflected that reality.</p> <!-- RTT removed image (333265) --> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the aftermath of the McGirt decision, the state of Oklahoma pushed a narrative of chaos and disruption in the criminal justice system, which some national outlets then repeated without much discernment. Can you talk about the role of the media \u2014 including the lack of Indigenous representation in newsrooms \u2014 and how that shapes the public\u2019s understanding of things like tribal sovereignty?</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> I think that it\u2019s a really big hindrance to our rights as Indigenous nations and to our sovereignty. Less than a fraction of a percent of the people staffing newsrooms are Native. Coverage of Indigenous issues very often fails to meet the standards of journalism. It doesn\u2019t have context, or a depth of knowledge of what\u2019s going on. They send reporters who\u2019ve never been on a reservation to do reporting about criminal justice on tribal land. It creates an environment where you can tell lies about tribes, and people will think that it\u2019s true.</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> </blockquote> <p>And unfortunately, that\u2019s what happened. In the wake of <em>McGirt</em>, (Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, R) made some very bold and outlandish claims about the number of criminal cases that could be prosecuted moving forward. I did some digging around with a fellow reporter, Allison Herrera, and Oklahoma\u2019s claims fell apart completely. But they were still repeated and cited by prominent outlets like the <em>Washington Post</em> and <em>The Wall Street Journal.</em> Oklahoma then cited those articles in their briefs, and some of that inaccurate information was actually in the (<em>Castro-Huerta</em>) Supreme Court decision. And so it was this tornado of disinformation that made it all the way up to the Supreme Court. Normally, we think that the <em>Washington Post</em> is a check on bad information, but not when it comes to tribes, which should be an embarrassment for them.</p> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>We\u2019re in a moment of major law and policy change under a new administration. What are some lessons from your reporting that apply to our current moment?</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> We talk about it as a problem that originates with Trump, instead of a problem that originates with some of the flaws in our democracy. And I think the treatment of Indigenous nations is a glaring example of that, because we\u2019ve never had any kind of constitutional amendment or reform to change those laws and to change those policies. To dispossess Indigenous people of their land, the U.S. government gave itself a lot of power over people who are not U.S. citizens. That power of empire is embedded in our Constitution, because our country wanted to take Indigenous land. We still see it manifested in deportation and shutting down asylum and separating families at the border and banning Muslims from entering our country. If we really don\u2019t want these types of policies to be enacted, there are some bigger questions about our democracy that as a society we haven\u2019t even begun to ask.</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p> If we really don\u2019t want these types of policies to be enacted, there are some bigger questions about our democracy that as a society we haven\u2019t even begun to ask.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>Given that, do you have any specific concerns about potential attacks on tribal sovereignty under a second Trump administration?</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> Everything has the capacity to get worse. A lot of tribal programs, whether it\u2019s (the Indian Health Service) or tribal courts, tribal law enforcement, rely on federal dollars. There\u2019s a lot specifically at stake for tribes under Trump. The remaking of the federal judiciary has a profound impact on tribes, because our cases are federal; they don\u2019t go through state court. And, unfortunately, the courts \u2014 dating back to before Trump \u2014 have not been reliable sources for justice for tribes. Even when the law is clearly on the tribe\u2019s side, courts have a very bad habit of bending and breaking the rules to satisfy the state or non-Native residents.

To dispossess Indigenous people of their land, the U.S. government gave itself a lot of power over people who are not U.S. citizens. That power of empire is embedded in our Constitution, because our country wanted to take Indigenous land. We still see it manifested in deportation and shutting down asylum and separating families at the border and banning Muslims from entering our country.

The remaking of the federal judiciary has a profound impact on tribes, because our cases are federal; they don\u2019t go through state court. And, unfortunately, the courts \u2014 dating back to before Trump \u2014 have not been reliable sources for justice for tribes. Even when the law is clearly on the tribe\u2019s side, courts have a very bad habit of bending and breaking the rules to satisfy the state or non-Native residents. One of the things that\u2019s really shocked me is how often our government institutions ignore the law when it comes to tribes and how hard tribes have to fight for just the law to be followed.

Smith, High Country NewsMarch 25, 2025<h1>Rebecca Nagle considers Supreme Court wins and what\u2019s at stake for tribes under Trump</h1> <p class=\"byline\">by Anna V. Smith, High Country News <br />March 25, 2025</p> <p class=\"has-drop-cap\">During the forced<strong> </strong>removal of Muscogee (Creek) people from their ancestral lands in the Southeastern U.S., tribal members carried the embers and ashes of their town fires with them, determined to re-establish the flames in the new communities they planned to build in what\u2019s now known as Oklahoma. Those fires still burn today in places on the Muscogee Reservation.</p> <div class=\"wp-block-group alignright\"> <!-- RTT removed image (333291) --> <p class=\"has-text-align-left\"><em><em>By the Fire We Carry</em> </em><br />By Rebecca Nagle<br />352 pages, hardcover: $30<br />Harper, 2024.</p> </p></div> <p>In <em>By the Fire We Carry</em>, Cherokee journalist Rebecca Nagle documents the interwoven stories of tribal land dispossession, forced removal, a murder in a small tribal community, her own family history and three recent and consequential Supreme Court decisions about tribal jurisdiction over lands in Oklahoma. Two of them, <em>Murphy v. Oklahoma</em> and <em>McGirt v. Oklahoma, </em>centered on crimes on land that the state of Oklahoma argued was no longer part of the Muscogee and Cherokee Nations\u2019 respective reservations. In both cases, the Supreme Court upheld the tribes\u2019 arguments in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. But shortly after came <em>Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta</em>, in which the Supreme Court sidestepped a century of federal Indian law and gave states jurisdiction to prosecute crimes on tribal lands when the perpetrator was non-Native and the victim was Native. The connections Nagle makes span generations and offer insight into our current political turmoil, at a time when a second Trump administration is testing the limits of executive authority and the law.</p> <p>In a conversation with <em>High Country News</em>, Nagle discusses how the U.S. still wields its power of empire, what impact the Trump administration could have on tribal sovereignty, and the enduring weight of history.</p> <p><em>This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p> <p><strong><em>High Country News</em></strong>: <strong>In this book, you don\u2019t just focus on the 20-year histories of these three Supreme Court cases but also tell the stories of the Muscogee and Cherokee nations before the U.S. existed. Why did you decide to take such a long view?</strong></p> <p><strong>Rebecca Nagle:</strong> One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present. I also wanted people to get a sense of how history repeats itself, and how things like a lie that tribal land is lawless get used over and over again, or the excuse that, \u201cOh, <em>this</em> is actually what\u2019s best for Native people.\u201d I wanted people to be able to see and identify those patterns.&nbsp;</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present.</p> </blockquote> <p>When I found out about the <em>McGirt</em> decision and saw the implications that my tribe\u2019s reservation would be recognized again, it was a really overwhelming emotion of relief, of joy, but there was also a lot of sadness, because I knew how much my ancestors, and Cherokee ancestors in general, had sacrificed to reach this moment. I think that a lot of other tribal citizens felt that the day that we were celebrating the Supreme Court decision. I think we all felt that weight of history. And I wanted the reader to feel that weight of history \u2014 to understand this isn\u2019t a simple story of, \u201cYay, the tribes won!\u201d There\u2019s a lot that\u2019s implicated in that victory and a lot that was lost for that rare legal victory to happen.</p> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the book you hold multiple difficult truths at once, like how George Jacobs\u2019 death \u2014 which caused so much pain for his community \u2014 was the origin of the Murphy case and also resulted in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. Similarly, the truth of your ancestor, John Ridge, who signed a treaty that resulted in forced removal of the Cherokee people. It was against their wishes, and also what he thought he had to do to save his nation. How did you navigate that? It can be so easy to collapse these tensions to make for a simpler narrative.&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> Absolutely. As a journalist, my North Star is the truth. And I think the truth is complicated. I don\u2019t think we can tell the whole story of the <em>McGirt</em> victory without talking about the crimes and the tragedy that it originated in. And I think the same is true for my ancestors. I was sort of raised to think one thing, but I went back through the historical records and really tried to look at it for what it was. There\u2019s a lot that we can learn from the desperation of my ancestors and their decision to sign that treaty. We can learn just how violent U.S. policy was at that time, that they would make a decision like that. There\u2019s a cultural impulse to tell stories where there are clear heroes and clear villains, and victories like <em>McGirt</em> come from a good place, and things are clean-cut. I think that history is actually quite messy. I wanted a book that reflected that reality.</p> <!-- RTT removed image (333265) --> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the aftermath of the McGirt decision, the state of Oklahoma pushed a narrative of chaos and disruption in the criminal justice system, which some national outlets then repeated without much discernment.

Less than a fraction of a percent of the people staffing newsrooms are Native. Coverage of Indigenous issues very often fails to meet the standards of journalism.

And I think the treatment of Indigenous nations is a glaring example of that, because we\u2019ve never had any kind of constitutional amendment or reform to change those laws and to change those policies. To dispossess Indigenous people of their land, the U.S. government gave itself a lot of power over people who are not U.S. citizens. That power of empire is embedded in our Constitution, because our country wanted to take Indigenous land. We still see it manifested in deportation and shutting down asylum and separating families at the border and banning Muslims from entering our country. If we really don\u2019t want these types of policies to be enacted, there are some bigger questions about our democracy that as a society we haven\u2019t even begun to ask.</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p> If we really don\u2019t want these types of policies to be enacted, there are some bigger questions about our democracy that as a society we haven\u2019t even begun to ask.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>Given that, do you have any specific concerns about potential attacks on tribal sovereignty under a second Trump administration?</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> Everything has the capacity to get worse. A lot of tribal programs, whether it\u2019s (the Indian Health Service) or tribal courts, tribal law enforcement, rely on federal dollars. There\u2019s a lot specifically at stake for tribes under Trump. The remaking of the federal judiciary has a profound impact on tribes, because our cases are federal; they don\u2019t go through state court. And, unfortunately, the courts \u2014 dating back to before Trump \u2014 have not been reliable sources for justice for tribes. Even when the law is clearly on the tribe\u2019s side, courts have a very bad habit of bending and breaking the rules to satisfy the state or non-Native residents. One of the things that\u2019s really shocked me is how often our government institutions ignore the law when it comes to tribes and how hard tribes have to fight for just the law to be followed. Those weaknesses in our democracy have been there for a long time.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p> <p><em>We welcome reader letters.

Smith, High Country NewsMarch 25, 2025<h1>Rebecca Nagle considers Supreme Court wins and what\u2019s at stake for tribes under Trump</h1> <p class=\"byline\">by Anna V. Smith, High Country News <br />March 25, 2025</p> <p class=\"has-drop-cap\">During the forced<strong> </strong>removal of Muscogee (Creek) people from their ancestral lands in the Southeastern U.S., tribal members carried the embers and ashes of their town fires with them, determined to re-establish the flames in the new communities they planned to build in what\u2019s now known as Oklahoma. Those fires still burn today in places on the Muscogee Reservation.</p> <div class=\"wp-block-group alignright\"> <!-- RTT removed image (333291) --> <p class=\"has-text-align-left\"><em><em>By the Fire We Carry</em> </em><br />By Rebecca Nagle<br />352 pages, hardcover: $30<br />Harper, 2024.</p> </p></div> <p>In <em>By the Fire We Carry</em>, Cherokee journalist Rebecca Nagle documents the interwoven stories of tribal land dispossession, forced removal, a murder in a small tribal community, her own family history and three recent and consequential Supreme Court decisions about tribal jurisdiction over lands in Oklahoma. Two of them, <em>Murphy v. Oklahoma</em> and <em>McGirt v. Oklahoma, </em>centered on crimes on land that the state of Oklahoma argued was no longer part of the Muscogee and Cherokee Nations\u2019 respective reservations. In both cases, the Supreme Court upheld the tribes\u2019 arguments in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. But shortly after came <em>Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta</em>, in which the Supreme Court sidestepped a century of federal Indian law and gave states jurisdiction to prosecute crimes on tribal lands when the perpetrator was non-Native and the victim was Native. The connections Nagle makes span generations and offer insight into our current political turmoil, at a time when a second Trump administration is testing the limits of executive authority and the law.</p> <p>In a conversation with <em>High Country News</em>, Nagle discusses how the U.S. still wields its power of empire, what impact the Trump administration could have on tribal sovereignty, and the enduring weight of history.</p> <p><em>This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p> <p><strong><em>High Country News</em></strong>: <strong>In this book, you don\u2019t just focus on the 20-year histories of these three Supreme Court cases but also tell the stories of the Muscogee and Cherokee nations before the U.S. existed. Why did you decide to take such a long view?</strong></p> <p><strong>Rebecca Nagle:</strong> One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present. I also wanted people to get a sense of how history repeats itself, and how things like a lie that tribal land is lawless get used over and over again, or the excuse that, \u201cOh, <em>this</em> is actually what\u2019s best for Native people.\u201d I wanted people to be able to see and identify those patterns.&nbsp;</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present.</p> </blockquote> <p>When I found out about the <em>McGirt</em> decision and saw the implications that my tribe\u2019s reservation would be recognized again, it was a really overwhelming emotion of relief, of joy, but there was also a lot of sadness, because I knew how much my ancestors, and Cherokee ancestors in general, had sacrificed to reach this moment. I think that a lot of other tribal citizens felt that the day that we were celebrating the Supreme Court decision. I think we all felt that weight of history. And I wanted the reader to feel that weight of history \u2014 to understand this isn\u2019t a simple story of, \u201cYay, the tribes won!\u201d There\u2019s a lot that\u2019s implicated in that victory and a lot that was lost for that rare legal victory to happen.</p> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the book you hold multiple difficult truths at once, like how George Jacobs\u2019 death \u2014 which caused so much pain for his community \u2014 was the origin of the Murphy case and also resulted in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. Similarly, the truth of your ancestor, John Ridge, who signed a treaty that resulted in forced removal of the Cherokee people. It was against their wishes, and also what he thought he had to do to save his nation. How did you navigate that? It can be so easy to collapse these tensions to make for a simpler narrative.&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> Absolutely. As a journalist, my North Star is the truth. And I think the truth is complicated. I don\u2019t think we can tell the whole story of the <em>McGirt</em> victory without talking about the crimes and the tragedy that it originated in. And I think the same is true for my ancestors. I was sort of raised to think one thing, but I went back through the historical records and really tried to look at it for what it was. There\u2019s a lot that we can learn from the desperation of my ancestors and their decision to sign that treaty. We can learn just how violent U.S. policy was at that time, that they would make a decision like that. There\u2019s a cultural impulse to tell stories where there are clear heroes and clear villains, and victories like <em>McGirt</em> come from a good place, and things are clean-cut. I think that history is actually quite messy. I wanted a book that reflected that reality.</p> <!-- RTT removed image (333265) --> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the aftermath of the McGirt decision, the state of Oklahoma pushed a narrative of chaos and disruption in the criminal justice system, which some national outlets then repeated without much discernment. Can you talk about the role of the media \u2014 including the lack of Indigenous representation in newsrooms \u2014 and how that shapes the public\u2019s understanding of things like tribal sovereignty?</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> I think that it\u2019s a really big hindrance to our rights as Indigenous nations and to our sovereignty. Less than a fraction of a percent of the people staffing newsrooms are Native. Coverage of Indigenous issues very often fails to meet the standards of journalism. It doesn\u2019t have context, or a depth of knowledge of what\u2019s going on. They send reporters who\u2019ve never been on a reservation to do reporting about criminal justice on tribal land. It creates an environment where you can tell lies about tribes, and people will think that it\u2019s true.</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> </blockquote> <p>And unfortunately, that\u2019s what happened. In the wake of <em>McGirt</em>, (Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, R) made some very bold and outlandish claims about the number of criminal cases that could be prosecuted moving forward. I did some digging around with a fellow reporter, Allison Herrera, and Oklahoma\u2019s claims fell apart completely. But they were still repeated and cited by prominent outlets like the <em>Washington Post</em> and <em>The Wall Street Journal.</em> Oklahoma then cited those articles in their briefs, and some of that inaccurate information was actually in the (<em>Castro-Huerta</em>) Supreme Court decision. And so it was this tornado of disinformation that made it all the way up to the Supreme Court. Normally, we think that the <em>Washington Post</em> is a check on bad information, but not when it comes to tribes, which should be an embarrassment for them.</p> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>We\u2019re in a moment of major law and policy change under a new administration.

Smith, High Country NewsMarch 25, 2025<h1>Rebecca Nagle considers Supreme Court wins and what\u2019s at stake for tribes under Trump</h1> <p class=\"byline\">by Anna V. Smith, High Country News <br />March 25, 2025</p> <p class=\"has-drop-cap\">During the forced<strong> </strong>removal of Muscogee (Creek) people from their ancestral lands in the Southeastern U.S., tribal members carried the embers and ashes of their town fires with them, determined to re-establish the flames in the new communities they planned to build in what\u2019s now known as Oklahoma. Those fires still burn today in places on the Muscogee Reservation.</p> <div class=\"wp-block-group alignright\"> <!-- RTT removed image (333291) --> <p class=\"has-text-align-left\"><em><em>By the Fire We Carry</em> </em><br />By Rebecca Nagle<br />352 pages, hardcover: $30<br />Harper, 2024.</p> </p></div> <p>In <em>By the Fire We Carry</em>, Cherokee journalist Rebecca Nagle documents the interwoven stories of tribal land dispossession, forced removal, a murder in a small tribal community, her own family history and three recent and consequential Supreme Court decisions about tribal jurisdiction over lands in Oklahoma. Two of them, <em>Murphy v. Oklahoma</em> and <em>McGirt v. Oklahoma, </em>centered on crimes on land that the state of Oklahoma argued was no longer part of the Muscogee and Cherokee Nations\u2019 respective reservations. In both cases, the Supreme Court upheld the tribes\u2019 arguments in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. But shortly after came <em>Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta</em>, in which the Supreme Court sidestepped a century of federal Indian law and gave states jurisdiction to prosecute crimes on tribal lands when the perpetrator was non-Native and the victim was Native. The connections Nagle makes span generations and offer insight into our current political turmoil, at a time when a second Trump administration is testing the limits of executive authority and the law.</p> <p>In a conversation with <em>High Country News</em>, Nagle discusses how the U.S. still wields its power of empire, what impact the Trump administration could have on tribal sovereignty, and the enduring weight of history.</p> <p><em>This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p> <p><strong><em>High Country News</em></strong>: <strong>In this book, you don\u2019t just focus on the 20-year histories of these three Supreme Court cases but also tell the stories of the Muscogee and Cherokee nations before the U.S. existed. Why did you decide to take such a long view?</strong></p> <p><strong>Rebecca Nagle:</strong> One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present. I also wanted people to get a sense of how history repeats itself, and how things like a lie that tribal land is lawless get used over and over again, or the excuse that, \u201cOh, <em>this</em> is actually what\u2019s best for Native people.\u201d I wanted people to be able to see and identify those patterns.&nbsp;</p> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>One of the big takeaways that I wanted people to have was how much history informs our present.</p> </blockquote> <p>When I found out about the <em>McGirt</em> decision and saw the implications that my tribe\u2019s reservation would be recognized again, it was a really overwhelming emotion of relief, of joy, but there was also a lot of sadness, because I knew how much my ancestors, and Cherokee ancestors in general, had sacrificed to reach this moment. I think that a lot of other tribal citizens felt that the day that we were celebrating the Supreme Court decision. I think we all felt that weight of history. And I wanted the reader to feel that weight of history \u2014 to understand this isn\u2019t a simple story of, \u201cYay, the tribes won!\u201d There\u2019s a lot that\u2019s implicated in that victory and a lot that was lost for that rare legal victory to happen.</p> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the book you hold multiple difficult truths at once, like how George Jacobs\u2019 death \u2014 which caused so much pain for his community \u2014 was the origin of the Murphy case and also resulted in a historic win for tribal sovereignty. Similarly, the truth of your ancestor, John Ridge, who signed a treaty that resulted in forced removal of the Cherokee people. It was against their wishes, and also what he thought he had to do to save his nation. How did you navigate that? It can be so easy to collapse these tensions to make for a simpler narrative.&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> Absolutely. As a journalist, my North Star is the truth. And I think the truth is complicated. I don\u2019t think we can tell the whole story of the <em>McGirt</em> victory without talking about the crimes and the tragedy that it originated in. And I think the same is true for my ancestors. I was sort of raised to think one thing, but I went back through the historical records and really tried to look at it for what it was. There\u2019s a lot that we can learn from the desperation of my ancestors and their decision to sign that treaty. We can learn just how violent U.S. policy was at that time, that they would make a decision like that. There\u2019s a cultural impulse to tell stories where there are clear heroes and clear villains, and victories like <em>McGirt</em> come from a good place, and things are clean-cut. I think that history is actually quite messy. I wanted a book that reflected that reality.</p> <!-- RTT removed image (333265) --> <p><strong><em>HCN:</em></strong> <strong>In the aftermath of the McGirt decision, the state of Oklahoma pushed a narrative of chaos and disruption in the criminal justice system, which some national outlets then repeated without much discernment.
