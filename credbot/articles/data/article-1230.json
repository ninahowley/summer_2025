conduct rules amended at lightning speed despite objection by law officers, documents show** **The amendment that limits public access to election-related documents and recordings was cleared and notified in two days.** On December 21,Scrollwas the first to report thatthe Conduct of Election Ruleshad been amended to deny public access to election-related papers \u2013 a move that the Opposition said would reduce transparency in the electoral process. Documents accessed byScrollnow reveal that this amendment was made at lightning speed \u2013 despite the law officers of the Union Law Ministry objecting to the original draft proposed by the Election Commission. The Election Commission wrote to the Ministry of Law on December 17, proposing an amendment to the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961. The letter was received by the ministry on December 19. The very next day, December 20, officers of the law ministry and the Election Commission discussed the proposed amendment, made changes to the draft, which was cleared by the law secretary and the Union law minister and sent back to the poll panel. That day itself, the Election Commission responded to the Law Ministry, accepting the draft copy of the amendment, and requesting that \u201cthe same may be notified at the earliest\u201d. The amendment was notified at 10.23 pm on December 20. A week before the Election Commission had initiated the amendment process, on December 9, the Punjab and Haryana High Court had directed the Election Commission to provide video recordings and copies of documents related to polling in the Haryana assembly elections to advocate Mehmood Pracha. The amendment ensured the Election Commission would not have to make these disclosures. **Disagreement between law ministry and ECI** The amendment was cleared and notified in less than two days despite law officers objecting to the language used in the original draft. The Election Commission wanted to amend Rule 93 of the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961. At that time, Rule 93 of the Conduct of Election Rules allowed public inspection of \u201call other papers relating to the election\u201d except electronic voting machines, used and unused ballot papers, a marked copy of the electoral roll, and Form 17A, which is a register of voters who have cast their votes in an election. This meant anyone could inspect electronic recordings like CCTV footage of polling booths and Form 17C, a document that records the total number of votes cast at a polling station for each candidate. Advocate Mehmood Pracha had sought access to Form 17 C and CCTV footage from polling booths in Haryana citing this rule, and the Punjab and Haryana High Court had upheld his plea. Within days of the court order, the Election Commission wrote to the law ministry, proposing Rule 93 be amended to limit public access to election-related papers and electronic recordings. Specifically, it proposed that sub-rule (2A) of Rule 93 be amended to add the word \u201cstatutory\u201d before \u201cpapers\u201d. At that time, the sub-rule said: \u201call other papers relating to the election shall be open to public inspection\u201d. In its letter, the poll panel argued: \u201cProviding non-statutory papers and electronic recordings necessitates involvement of substantial manpower, which is impractical post-election, as administrative resources are significantly reduced.\u201d It added that since \u201cthe office of the Returning Officer ceases to exist\u201d after an election is over, \u201cassigning them additional workload of supplying non-statutory documents post elections, at such a large scale, will overburden and cripple the administrative functioning in the field\u201d. The Election Commission also argued that providing public access to \u201call other papers\u201d related to elections may \u201ccreate confusion\u201d. \u201cFurther, the term \u2018all other papers\u2019 is a wide term and can be interpreted to include all kinds of materials related to election, which may create confusion and unnecessary administrative burden, serving no legal purpose,\u201d it wrote in its letter to the law ministry. Correspondence between the poll panel and the law ministry accessed byScrollreveals that the law officers objected to the proposed amendment. The officers told the poll body that sub rules (1) and (1A) of Rule 93 of Conduct of Elections Rules provide a list of election records that cannot be accessed by public, and adding \u201cstatutory\u201d in sub-rule (2) of Rule 93 would \u201cimpose further restrictions on the inspection of papers\u201d which may not be the intention of Conduct of Elections Rules which have been in place for last 63 years. \u201cPutting the word \u2018statutory\u2019 before the word \u2018papers\u2019 will impose further restrictions on the inspection of papers which may not be the intention of sub-rule (2) of Conduct of Elections Rules,\u201d law ministry officials wrote. The officials further argued that \u201cthe word \u2018statutory\u2019 is not defined and inference of its meaning may not be ascertained from the construction of the language of the rules. This will lead to ambiguity to the provisions thereof.\u201d Documents accessed byScrollshow that at the insistence of law officers, the Election Commission agreed to replace \u201cstatutory papers\u201d with \u201call other papers specified in these rules\u201d in the proposed amendment to the Conduct of Elections Rules. While the original amendment proposed by the Election Commission would have given it greater discretion to deny access to any document not defined or explicitly stated in the rules, the changed provision appears to leave room for the inspection of records that have not been explicitly denied to the public.
