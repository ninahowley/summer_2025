Armed with Molotov cocktails and a questionable grasp of strategy, the demonstrators torched government buildings while chanting, \u201cDon\u2019t deport us back to paradise!\u201d The protest, dubbed \u201cOperation Burn to Belong,\u201d saw participants hurl flaming bottles at ICE facilities, with one protester, who asked to be called \u201cPatriotic Pyromaniac,\u201d explaining the genius plan: \u201cIf we destroy America, they can\u2019t send us back to Mexico, where the food is amazing and the family misses us. It\u2019s self-preservation!\u201d Another added, \u201cPlus, the Wi-Fi here is 5G\u2014back home it\u2019s still carrier pigeons!\u201d Eyewitnesses described a surreal scene as protesters, clad in black and waving \u201cStay Here, Burn There\u201d banners, lobbed \u201cLove they Neighbor\u201d Molotovs with surprising precision. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen someone light their future on fire with such enthusiasm,\u201d said bystander Jane Smith, ducking behind a mailbox. \u201cIt\u2019s like they\u2019re renovating a house by setting it ablaze.\u201d Local authorities reported significant damage, with LAPD Chief Rodriguez noting, \u201cWe\u2019re used to protests, but this is the first time someone\u2019s tried to stay in a country by turning it into a bonfire. I\u2019m calling it \u2018reverse tourism.\u2019\u201d Firefighters, meanwhile, were seen handing out loyalty cards: \u201cPunch 10 blazes, get a free extinguisher!\u201d The movement\u2019s leaders claim the firebombing is a cry for love, not hate, with one organizer stating, \u201cWe\u2019re just showing America how much we want to stay by giving it a warm makeover.\u201d Rumors swirl that the Molotovs were sourced from a bulk discount site, complete with a \u201cWelcome to Chaos\u201d instruction manual. As smoke cleared and sirens wailed, the protesters vowed to escalate, promising more fiery displays until the U.S. agrees to let them remain\u2014presumably to continue their unique redecoration project. Canada, watching from the sidelines, reportedly doubled its border patrol and added a \u201cNo Matches\u201d policy. **About Author** Exavier is an excellent writer\u2014tremendous.
