Hiroo Onoda is a Japanese citizen that originally worked at a Chinese trading company. When he was 20 years old, he was called to join the Japanese army. He promptly quit his job and headed off to training in Japan. At a certain point in his training, he was chosen to be trained at Nakano School as an Imperial Army Intelligence Officer. In this specialized military intelligence training, he was specifically taught methods of gathering intelligence and how to conduct guerrilla warfare. He was being groomed to go in behind enemy lines and be left with small pockets of soldiers to make life miserable for Japan\u2019s enemies and gather intelligence in the process. On December 26th, 1944, Onoda was sent to Lubang Island in the Philippines. His orders from his commanding officers, Major Yoshimi Taniguchi, were simple: You are absolutely forbidden to die by your own hand. It may take three years, it may take five, but whatever happens, we\u2019ll come back for you. Until then, so long as you have one soldier, you are to continue to lead him. You may have to live on coconuts. If that\u2019s the case, live on coconuts! Under no circumstances are you [to] give up your life voluntarily. Onoda then linked up with Japanese soldiers already on the island and shortly thereafter the island was overrun by enemy troops when other officers that were already on the island refused to help fulfill part of the orders that Onoda was given to destroy the harbor and airfield among other things. This in turn made it easier for the Allied forces to conquer the island, landing on February 28th, 1945. Shortly after the island was conquered the remaining Japanese soldiers split up into small groups of 3 or 4 and headed into the jungle. Most of these small groups were quickly killed off. Onoda\u2019s group though consisting of himself, Yuichi Akatsu, Siochi Shimada, and Kinshichi Kozuka, were not. They continued to use guerrilla warfare tactics to harry the enemy troops as best they could while strictly rationing supplies including food, ammo, etc. Supplementing their small rice rations with bananas, coconuts, and other food from the jungle as well as doing raids on local farms when they could manage it. In October 1945, after another cell had killed a cow from a local farm for food, they came across a leaflet from the local islanders to them saying \u201cThe war ended August 15th. Come down from the mountains!\u201d The few remaining cells discussed this leaflet extensively, but eventually decided that it was Allied propaganda trying to get them to give themselves up. They felt that there was no way that Japan could have lost so quickly since the time when they were deployed. Indeed, this would seem strange to anyone who had no knowledge of the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Also, another one of the cells had been fired upon just a few days before; they felt that this wouldn\u2019t have happened if the war was over. Eventually, near the end of the same year local islanders, fed up with being shot at and raided, got a Boeing B-17 to drop leaflets all over the jungle. These leaflets had the order to surrender printed on them from General Yamashita. The few remaining cells once again scrutinized these leaflets to try to determine their authenticity. In the end, the wording on the leaflet pertaining to the method with which they would be sent back to Japan seemed fishy to them; largely because the wording made it seem as if Japan had lost, something they couldn\u2019t fathom and which was a big problem in their willingness to accept the war had ended. If Japan had won, they would come and get them. Japan couldn\u2019t lose, so the war must still be going. So they once again believed it was the Allies becoming more tired of their successful guerrilla tactics and trying to get them to surrender. When this didn\u2019t work, more leaflets were dropped with newspapers from Japan; photographs and letters from the soldiers families; delegates were sent from Japan and went through the jungle speaking over loudspeakers begging the soldiers to give themselves up. In every case the cells encountered, there was always something suspicious in their minds about the way it was done to cause them to believe it was an elaborate hoax by the Allied troops. Years passed in the jungle with these four soldiers continuing to perform their sworn duty of harrying the enemy at every opportunity and gather intelligence as best they could. At a certain point, when most everybody they saw was dressed in civilian clothing, they began thinking that this too was a ruse from the Allied forces to lull the Japanese guerrilla soldiers into a false sense of confidence. They considered the fact that every time they fired on these \u201ccivilians\u201d shortly thereafter search parties would arrive hunting them. Over time they had gradually let their solitude twist their minds into thinking everyone was an enemy, even their own fellow Japanese who would occasionally come and try to find them and get them to come home. These of course in their minds were Japanese prisoners forced to come lure them away from the safety of the jungle. Eventually, after about 5 years in the jungle, Akatsu decided he would surrender, but didn\u2019t tell the other three soldiers. So, in 1949 he slipped away from the others and after 6 months alone in the jungle was able to successfully surrender to what he thought were Allied troops. Because of this event, Onoda\u2019s cell became even more cautious and went into deeper hiding and took fewer risks as they viewed Akatsu leaving as a security threat. \u201cWhat if he was captured\u201d, they thought. About 5 years later, another of the small group, Shimada was killed in a skirmish on the beach at Gontin. Now there were only two, Onoda and Kozuka. For about 17 more years the two lived in the jungle, gathering intelligence as best they could and attacking the \u201cenemy troops\u201d when they could risk it. They were still convinced that eventually Japan would dispatch more troops and they would then train these troops in guerrilla warfare and use the intelligence they had gathered to re-take the island. After all, their orders were to stay put and do as they had done until their commanding officer came and got them and their commanding officers had promised to do so no matter what. Now in October 1972, after 27 years of hiding Kozuka was killed during a fight with a Filipino patrol. The Japanese had long thought he had already died, they didn\u2019t think he could have survived so long in the jungle. But now when they had his body, they began thinking perhaps Onoda was also still alive, even though he had also long since been declared dead. The Japanese then sent a search party to try to find Onoda in the jungle. Unfortunately, he was too good at hiding with 27 years of practice. They could not find him. Onoda continued his mission. Finally in 1974 a college student, Nario Suzuki, decided to travel the world. Among his list of things to do on his journey was to find \u201cOnoda, a panda, and the Abominable Snowman\u201d. He traveled to the island and trekked through the jungle searching for signs of Onoda. Shockingly, where literally thousands of others through the last 29 years had failed, Suzuki succeeded. He found Onoda\u2019s dwelling place and Onoda himself. He then proceeded to try to convince Onoda to come home with him. Onoda refused. His commanding officers had said they would return for him no matter what. He would not surrender nor believe the war was over until they returned and ordered him to do so. At this point, he would not have been allowed to simply go home; he would be required to surrender and throw himself on the mercy of the enemy. Over the years he had been too successful at using the guerrilla tactics he had mastered. Killing 30 Filipinos and injuring over 100 others as well as destroying various crops and the like for almost 30 years. Suzuki then traveled back to Japan with the news he\u2019d found Onoda; Major Taniguchi, now retired and working at a book store, was then brought back to the island and to Onoda to tell him that Japan had lost the war and he was to give up his weapons and surrender to the Filipinos. As you might expect, after living in the jungle doing what he thought was his duty helping Japan, now only turning out to be wasting 29 years of his life, and worse killing and injuring innocent civilians, this came as a crushing blow to Onoda. We really lost the war! How could they have been so sloppy? Suddenly everything went black. A storm raged inside me. I felt like a fool for having been so tense and cautious on the way here. Worse than that, what had I been doing for all these years? Gradually the storm subsided, and for the first time I really understood: my thirty years as a guerrilla fighter for the Japanese army were abruptly finished. This was the end. I pulled back the bolt on my rifle and unloaded the bullets. . . . I eased off the pack that I always carried with me and laid the gun on top of it. Would I really have no more use for this rifle that I had polished and cared for like a baby all these years? Or Kozuka\u2019s rifle, which I had hidden in a crevice in the rocks? Had the war really ended thirty years ago? If it had, what had Shimada and Kozuka died for? If what was happening was true, wouldn\u2019t it have been better if I had died with them? On March 10th, 1975 at the age of 52, Onoda in full uniform that was somehow still immaculately kept, marched out of the jungle and surrendered his samurai sword to the Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos. Marcos, very unpopularly in the Philippines, but immensely popular in Japan, pardoned Onoda for his crimes, given that Onoda had thought he was still at war the entire time. Now in the end, we might look at Onoda as a fool and worse, a murder of innocent people. In the end, he was both of those things, there is no denying it. But at the same time, not everyone who lives by strict convictions and puts their all into achieving what they believe to be the right thing, ends up having what they strive towards turn out well or end up being a good thing. This is one of those cases where someone did something remarkable, showing extreme dedication to his country and his duty, as well as fortitude unmatched by many in history. Had circumstances been different and the war really had waged on so long; soldiers and people from both sides of the fight would have respected him for his courage and dedication. In that respect he was more of a hero. However, the world wasn\u2019t the way he thought and in the end, in retrospect, he was more a fool than anything else. But at the same time, we can\u2019t ignore that this was a man who did something great with respect to doing something that few others could have done; had circumstances been as he thought, what he did was something to be admired. He faced (what he thought) was death around every corner and lived in an extreme situation for 30 years, fighting for his country. That should be respected. It\u2019s a rare person who could do something like that and never quite or surrender; never take the easy way out as most of us do all the time when faced with adversity that is orders of magnitude less than what Onoda faced for almost 30 years in the jungle.

He was also given his pay for the last 30 years. Life was much different in Japan now than he remembered, and not at all to his liking. Many of the traditional Japanese virtues he cherished such as patriotism were nearly non-existent in the culture; indeed in his view Japan now cow-towed to the rest of the world and had lost its pride and sense of itself. So he moved to Brazil and used his pay to buy himself a ranch there and eventually married. Onoda released an autobiography:No Surrender, My Thirty-Year Warin which he details his life as a guerrilla fighter. After reading about a Japanese teenager who had murdered his own parents in 1980, Onoda became even more distressed at the state of his country and young people in Japan. He then returned to Japan in 1984, establishing a nature school for young people where he could teach them various survival techniques and teach them to be more independent and better Japanese citizens. In May 1996, he returned to the Philippines to the island he had lived for 30 years donating $10,000 to local schools; as you might imagine, he is not too popular with the locals there, despite the donation. BonusOnoda Quotes: Men should never give up. I never do. I would hate to lose. Men should never compete with women. If they do, the guys will always lose. That is because women have a lot more endurance. My mother said that, and she was so right. One must always be civic-minded. Every minute of every day, for 30 years, I served my country. I have never even wondered if that was good or bad for me as an individual. Parents should raise more independent children. When I was living in Brazil in the 1980s, I read that a 19-year-old Japanese man killed his parents after failing the university entrance exam. I was stunned. Why had he killed his parents instead of moving out? I guess he didn\u2019t have enough confidence. I thought this was a sign that Japanese were getting too weak. I decided to move back to Japan to establish a nature school to give children more power. Parents should remember that they are supposed to die before their children. Nobody will help them later on, so the greatest gift parents can give their children is independence. Never complain. When I did, my mother said that if I didn\u2019t like my life, I could just give up and die. She reminded me that when I was inside her, I told her that I wanted to be born, so she delivered me, breastfed me and changed my diapers. She said that I had to be brave.

The fastest way to end the war was to demonstrate the bomb . It only took two bombs to bring the Japanese hawks to their senses. and estimated 30 million people had died fighting the Axis powers in the previous five years, people across the world were sick of war. Had we not used the bomb, it would have entailed a land invasion of the japanese mainland, that would have taken another two years, and another million Allied troops and possibly 10 million japanese would have died. So the death toll from the two bombs, about 100,000 dead, was a cheap price to pay by the japanese to bring it all to and end. Then we get the comments here trying to paint the Allies as the bad guys. Lets just get this clear. The Germans and the Japanese started WW2, and purely to enslave and conquer the world. The Axis power did horrendous things to civilians, from death camps to using them for medical experiments. Another point was to help ensure complete cessation by Russia, it was necessary to demonstrate to Stalin we had the bomb, because the russians were working on the same thing. The credible nuclear deterrent that evolved from the 1945 started the cold war, and prevented all out nuclear war for the next 75 years. Twice in the 20th century America and the UK have been dragged into a world war not of their making and which we did not ask for. And part of the blame for that lies with Japan. They started it, and we finished it, to preserve freedom and democracy.danish baconJanuary 28, 2015 10:38 amDid you know the americans testet nuclearweapons on their own soldiers , up to 5o.ooo persons at one time.RivkaJuly 6, 2015 10:05 pmI do think the bomb was wrong, but does the fact that the USA did wrong things make Japan\u2019s atrocities any better?All groups of human beings are pretty messed up.SomeguyJuly 12, 2015 10:33 amThe Japanese usually would rather fight to the death or kill themselves before they gave up. There is few other countries that are this serious about war. I would rather have dropped a few nuclear bombs than fight that kind of fight all the way to their capital.Miss ChrisJanuary 24, 2020 11:22 pmAny way you look at it, atrocities were committed everywhere, and still are to this day, maybe not at the same measure, but they are\u2026Nobody wins in war\u2026shiuDecember 5, 2015 9:55 pmYou realize they did extensive testing of the bomb and estimates of loss of life based on the current fighting in the Pacific didn\u2019t you? A loss of another 1,000,000 ALLIED lives gone if the war was fought in the conventional way.It\u2019s funny how the U.S. is supposed to be careful in every way to be SURE not take any more Japanese lives than necessary, according to you, yet you say nothing of Pearl Harbor. Oh, stop it. Geesh.ChesterJanuary 2, 2016 2:25 pmThe bombs was not test. It was meant to destroy those Japanese people and factories who indirectly supporting Japanese troops killing innocent people around World at back end. You should be grateful the bomb was invented and used by US 1st, otherwise you might speak Japanese or German by now.But, if you do speak Japanese or German then you should feel lucky that US only drop 2 bombs.XX Jaycam XXJanuary 22, 2016 3:46 amOne of the single biggest atrocities in human history was America dropping the A bombs on Japan. The amount of unimaginable suffering & death of innocent men, women & children that had no say in the war to begin with was nothing more than a test to see the effects of nuclear devastation on the human populace. There was no excuse for the A bombs to be used & if people think there was then WHY HASN\u2019T IT EVER HAPPENED SINCE. Stop lying to yourselves and everyone & face the truth of murdering innocence, they WERE NOT SOLDIERS, THEY WERE INNOCENT CIVILIANS.txpackfanFebruary 20, 2016 5:10 amI\u2019m not sure what you use to determine atrocities, but the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki weren\u2019t even the largest death tolls by American bombing in Japan. Indeed, the campaign of fire bombing large cities initiated by General LeMay in early 1945 took the lives of hundreds of thousands of civilians. As far as atrocities, I suggest you study the Japanese wartime occupation of Nanking, China before declaring the worst atrocity.As American troops got closer to Japan, Japanese defenses stiffened. On Iwo Jima and Okinawa, entire divisions of Japanese troops died without a single surrender. In some cases the Japanese soldier was not \u201callowed\u201d to die until he had killed at least 4 American soldiers! At this time on the main islands of Japan, every civilian was training and was expected to fight the invading enemy, or die. The Japanese civilian population was completely committed to the war effort, and Japan\u2019s wartime government had rejected all calls for surrender. Some Allied planners estimated that 1 million Allied troops (mostly American) would be lost during the invasion of Japan. Remember, Japan had millions of troops, and thousands of airplanes maintained just for homeland defense. Japan was certainly going to lose the war, but they were going to bleed the Allieds dry doing so.Obviously, President Truman decided to drop the atomic bombs. A full-scale invasion of Japan would\u2019ve resulted in the loss of 10\u2019s of millions of additional people (military and civilian), the inevitable destruction of Japanese monuments, and quite possibly the end of the Japanese civilization as we know it!It ain\u2019t always black and white, my friend.Theblade12July 31, 2016 2:54 pm\u2026Is it not obvious why no more nuclear weapons have been used, beyond testing them at uninhabited areas?Back then, it was probably the largest war ever to be waged by humans. The nuclear bombs were used to stop said war. But, if yet another nuclear weapon were to be launched now, while the world is, for the most part, peaceful, what do you think would happen?I\u2019ll answer that question for you. What would surely grow to become world war three would start.Millions would die, once again, but this time, not for the sake of peace, but for the sake of war.razJuly 3, 2018 7:05 amit seems people want to believe what ever they want to but when you think of japan back in those days before giving up to the Americans you need to know that all the major cities of japan were already wiped of the map and there was no communications left so headquarters did not know that the Americans had even dropped the bombs so your assertion that the atom bomb ended the war is wrong \u2013 the Japs capitulated because the news that Stalin had jumped there border was what actually ended the war Trueman wanted to show the Ruskies he was the one with the ace up the sleeve and to not screw with the American Gov\u2019t \u2013 russia wanted the spoils of japan too \u2013 don\u2019t believe me though find out yourself \u2013ClaytonDecember 5, 2018 5:32 amAs Christopher Titus said: To the Japanese People, I will admit that (we) overreacted, but hey, you started it.Miss ChrisJanuary 24, 2020 11:40 pmAnother was the Holocaust-and there is so much more unbelievable conduct displayed by so-called \u201chumans\u201d everywhere than what any history book reveals.AndoresJanuary 23, 2016 9:08 amYou do know that Churchill killed 6-7 million Indians via starvation right?You do know that Churchill committed genocide against a group of Afrikaaners right? All 28,000 of them?You do know that by the time WW1 ended, Churchill had (directly or indirectly caused the deaths of around 15 million deaths, and the British troops caused 20 \u2013 100 million deaths by spreading the Spanish Flu?No, I didn\u2019t think so.E. HondaMay 15, 2016 11:19 pmThe West/Allies/Britain, America, et al were directly responsible for WWII in the first place. It was the ruthless and greedy manner in which they inflicted extraordinary poverty on the German civilian populace following WWI that engendered the Third Reich and insured Hitler\u2019s message of racial supremacy resonated powerfully with the German people.German children were literally starving on farms! Their families PRODUCED the food but couldn\u2019t afford any of it.Still, the only people to even come close to the Japanese having performed human vivisection, cannibalism, competitive baby bayonneting, forced prostitution of seniors, and weapons testing on random civilians were the Nazis and we don\u2019t cry for their civilians or the bombing/rape of Berlin. We don\u2019t even talk about that.The Japanese were animals during that war. I only feel for the Japanese civilians who didn\u2019t have children in the military, children living at home during the bombing \u2013 and the civilians tormented the world over on account of that war, really. Filipino children too!! 300 Filipino civilians died to this champion boner who couldn\u2019t tell time?The bombs should\u2019ve been dropped on military targets \u2013 not civilians.Still, I don\u2019t think there were any victims in that. The war wasn\u2019t about good vs. evil and none of the cast members were good. It was all causality.BobOctober 31, 2017 12:19 pmI didn\u2019t know Churchill personally took food away from people in India. Were you there to witness this? One man cannot personally starve millions.Mathew MolkJune 1, 2016 4:58 pmYou revisionist Historian clown.Tested? \u2013 We \u201cTested\u201d fire bombs on Tokyo too, Trying to win WW II.But then Jap civilians who beat and killed GI POWs were only \u201ctesting\u201d tooWhat about the Batman Death March ? That was one hell of a test.Was Yamamoto just \u201cTesting\u201d bombs on the civilians that were killed in the Pearl Harbor sneak attack?Supposed you never heard of Gen.

Did Superman have anything to say about it?John Curtis GibsonDecember 18, 2017 3:40 pmJapanese is Chinese. Same language writing (Kanji means Chinese. Hello, if the word \u201cEnglish\u201d means French, then what is the difference?). Same building(Tang dynasty building code) , same dress , same face. The word Japan itself is invented by the Mandarin.Tom OConnorOctober 26, 2018 12:48 am1. The Chinese word for Japan is \u65e5\u672c (R\u00ecb\u011bn in Pinyin) so you got that wrong.2. \u201cJapanese is Chinese\u201d \u2013 Couldn\u2019t be further from the truth. Their DNA is not in common at all. Also, tell that to the cities of Shanghai and Nanjing\u2026as well as China overall. While true that Japan \u201cstole\u201d many Chinese characters, as they had no writing style of their own, while stealing the characters, in Kanji the meanings and pronunciations of the characters are completely different.3. \u201cThe word English means French\u201d? \u2013 What in the hell does that even mean? In Chinese, English is \u82f1\u6587 (Y\u012bngw\u00e9n in Pinyin) and French is \u6cd5\u8bed (F\u01cey\u01d4 in Pinyin).Kanji is just the name of the Chinese characters that they \u201cstole\u201d from the Chinese.Fabian FragiaoMarch 11, 2018 12:22 amThe bombs despite it\u2019s terrible power helped save perhaps millions upon millions of American, their Allies and Japanese people. The dropping of both bombs was not an experiment but meant to end the war and it did. The story of the Japanese soldier who refused to quit fighting is an indication of what would have happened if the Emperor of Japan did tell these dedicated Japanese soldiers would have done to the invaders. They would have fought any invaders to the death.US Army Veteran station in the Far EastJohnJune 12, 2019 2:14 pmTest nothing\u2026.they started a war committing horrible atrocities and we ended it by kicking their ass.JBMarch 22, 2020 6:51 amNot true, it was the only way the Japenese would stop killing, and it took 2 to get the message across.RayJanuary 8, 2015 8:05 am@LindsayI hate the self righteous attitude of people who blame everything on the Japanese without ever considering (or reading up) on what the Allies did (read up a bit on events after Germany\u2019s defeat- rape, horrific torture and mutilation, bestiality). Yes, the Japanese committed many atrocities in the war (as did the Allies, but of course we never hear about them because after all, \u201chistory is written by the winners\u201d), but why can\u2019t we put that aside for one moment just to praise this man who was only following orders for his dedication and loyalty? Because quite frankly, I think tenacity and dedication is something the youth these days (especially in the USA) are lacking.jamesMay 25, 2015 7:23 amyou have no ideas to the brutality committed by your military.

The Japanese didn\u2019t care about how many civilians they Killed Dec, 7, 1941 !! Do some reading about US Military History Americans were the most Humane warriors in the world.The bomb was dropped because stupid Imperial Japanese leaders ordered their soldiers to fight to the deathif you admire them I can tell you about several operations I as a Marin was told the same thing in Vietnam!Don\u2019t make anymore stupid remarks about how Great Japanese soldiers were!Semper FiCapt Ed McCourtUS Marine Corps retiredRecipient of theSilver Star , two Purple Combat action ribbon with Gold StarVietnamese Cross of Gallantry with Gold Palm frown equal to the US Silver Star the third highestCombat personal decoration 2nd only to the Medal of HonorPS: My Foster father was a Nisei 2nd Generation Japanese American who\u2019s family were held in detainment camps while he and his Brother Fought in Europe in the Famed 442nd RCT 100th Bn. because the Japanese started the war the 442 RCT 100th BN were the highest decorated Army Unit in WW II while he was off fighting for America where he was born the Govt took his family\u2019 160 acre strawberry farm and auctioned it off!you could learn a lot about from Neis\u2019s about how great you thought the Japanese were during WW-IIbecause they would fight t to the death!

As an AUSTRALIAN (not American or Japanese, so I\u2019m not being biased), I believe that ALL armies in this world are trash.An army\u2019s sole purpose is to kill other armies. Killing a person is trash no matter the reason. No one has the right to steal the life of another person. So please, stop arguing about which country was trashier and MOVE ON. Remember the horrible, twisted, and evil events that happened all over the globe throughout those years, and be a better person today.An annoyed teen tired of adults ranting onlineOctober 24, 2020 2:30 amAnd yes, I know this comment thread is very old. But my point remains valid. However, I think that with Trump as President, the people commenting might have different views about the matter since the 2000s.Also, this comment section is PERFECT for writing inspiration. Right now, I\u2019m writing about a racist white guy, and the white-supremacist remarks made here are spot on *insert chef\u2019s kiss*. I do hope my comment gets moderated and published\u2026And fyi, I\u2019m also Chilean.(For the people who prefer to stay ignorant about foreign countries that aren\u2019t China or produce anime, Chile is in South America. And no, we do not live in straw huts, and no, I am not a refugee). So me saying that 90% of the people here are racist is a completely valid point, as it is not being said by a confused white girl.Wait, AM I BECOMING ONE OF THE PEOPLE RANTING IN THE COMMENT SECTIONS???oh, no. I think I am..I literally shut down other people for ranting online\u2026 Okay then, I\u2019ll say bye then. Have a nice day \ud83d\ude42 Wow, that was the single awesome thing I found out today. I really admire Japan and how it was back then. Never surrender. EPIC.

The fastest way to end the war was to demonstrate the bomb . It only took two bombs to bring the Japanese hawks to their senses. and estimated 30 million people had died fighting the Axis powers in the previous five years, people across the world were sick of war. Had we not used the bomb, it would have entailed a land invasion of the japanese mainland, that would have taken another two years, and another million Allied troops and possibly 10 million japanese would have died. So the death toll from the two bombs, about 100,000 dead, was a cheap price to pay by the japanese to bring it all to and end. Then we get the comments here trying to paint the Allies as the bad guys. Lets just get this clear. The Germans and the Japanese started WW2, and purely to enslave and conquer the world. The Axis power did horrendous things to civilians, from death camps to using them for medical experiments. Another point was to help ensure complete cessation by Russia, it was necessary to demonstrate to Stalin we had the bomb, because the russians were working on the same thing. The credible nuclear deterrent that evolved from the 1945 started the cold war, and prevented all out nuclear war for the next 75 years. Twice in the 20th century America and the UK have been dragged into a world war not of their making and which we did not ask for. And part of the blame for that lies with Japan. They started it, and we finished it, to preserve freedom and democracy.danish baconJanuary 28, 2015 10:38 amDid you know the americans testet nuclearweapons on their own soldiers , up to 5o.ooo persons at one time.RivkaJuly 6, 2015 10:05 pmI do think the bomb was wrong, but does the fact that the USA did wrong things make Japan\u2019s atrocities any better?All groups of human beings are pretty messed up.SomeguyJuly 12, 2015 10:33 amThe Japanese usually would rather fight to the death or kill themselves before they gave up. There is few other countries that are this serious about war. I would rather have dropped a few nuclear bombs than fight that kind of fight all the way to their capital.Miss ChrisJanuary 24, 2020 11:22 pmAny way you look at it, atrocities were committed everywhere, and still are to this day, maybe not at the same measure, but they are\u2026Nobody wins in war\u2026shiuDecember 5, 2015 9:55 pmYou realize they did extensive testing of the bomb and estimates of loss of life based on the current fighting in the Pacific didn\u2019t you? A loss of another 1,000,000 ALLIED lives gone if the war was fought in the conventional way.It\u2019s funny how the U.S. is supposed to be careful in every way to be SURE not take any more Japanese lives than necessary, according to you, yet you say nothing of Pearl Harbor. Oh, stop it. Geesh.ChesterJanuary 2, 2016 2:25 pmThe bombs was not test. It was meant to destroy those Japanese people and factories who indirectly supporting Japanese troops killing innocent people around World at back end. You should be grateful the bomb was invented and used by US 1st, otherwise you might speak Japanese or German by now.But, if you do speak Japanese or German then you should feel lucky that US only drop 2 bombs.XX Jaycam XXJanuary 22, 2016 3:46 amOne of the single biggest atrocities in human history was America dropping the A bombs on Japan. The amount of unimaginable suffering & death of innocent men, women & children that had no say in the war to begin with was nothing more than a test to see the effects of nuclear devastation on the human populace. There was no excuse for the A bombs to be used & if people think there was then WHY HASN\u2019T IT EVER HAPPENED SINCE. Stop lying to yourselves and everyone & face the truth of murdering innocence, they WERE NOT SOLDIERS, THEY WERE INNOCENT CIVILIANS.txpackfanFebruary 20, 2016 5:10 amI\u2019m not sure what you use to determine atrocities, but the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki weren\u2019t even the largest death tolls by American bombing in Japan. Indeed, the campaign of fire bombing large cities initiated by General LeMay in early 1945 took the lives of hundreds of thousands of civilians. As far as atrocities, I suggest you study the Japanese wartime occupation of Nanking, China before declaring the worst atrocity.As American troops got closer to Japan, Japanese defenses stiffened. On Iwo Jima and Okinawa, entire divisions of Japanese troops died without a single surrender. In some cases the Japanese soldier was not \u201callowed\u201d to die until he had killed at least 4 American soldiers! At this time on the main islands of Japan, every civilian was training and was expected to fight the invading enemy, or die. The Japanese civilian population was completely committed to the war effort, and Japan\u2019s wartime government had rejected all calls for surrender. Some Allied planners estimated that 1 million Allied troops (mostly American) would be lost during the invasion of Japan. Remember, Japan had millions of troops, and thousands of airplanes maintained just for homeland defense. Japan was certainly going to lose the war, but they were going to bleed the Allieds dry doing so.Obviously, President Truman decided to drop the atomic bombs. A full-scale invasion of Japan would\u2019ve resulted in the loss of 10\u2019s of millions of additional people (military and civilian), the inevitable destruction of Japanese monuments, and quite possibly the end of the Japanese civilization as we know it!It ain\u2019t always black and white, my friend.Theblade12July 31, 2016 2:54 pm\u2026Is it not obvious why no more nuclear weapons have been used, beyond testing them at uninhabited areas?Back then, it was probably the largest war ever to be waged by humans. The nuclear bombs were used to stop said war. But, if yet another nuclear weapon were to be launched now, while the world is, for the most part, peaceful, what do you think would happen?I\u2019ll answer that question for you. What would surely grow to become world war three would start.Millions would die, once again, but this time, not for the sake of peace, but for the sake of war.razJuly 3, 2018 7:05 amit seems people want to believe what ever they want to but when you think of japan back in those days before giving up to the Americans you need to know that all the major cities of japan were already wiped of the map and there was no communications left so headquarters did not know that the Americans had even dropped the bombs so your assertion that the atom bomb ended the war is wrong \u2013 the Japs capitulated because the news that Stalin had jumped there border was what actually ended the war Trueman wanted to show the Ruskies he was the one with the ace up the sleeve and to not screw with the American Gov\u2019t \u2013 russia wanted the spoils of japan too \u2013 don\u2019t believe me though find out yourself \u2013ClaytonDecember 5, 2018 5:32 amAs Christopher Titus said: To the Japanese People, I will admit that (we) overreacted, but hey, you started it.Miss ChrisJanuary 24, 2020 11:40 pmAnother was the Holocaust-and there is so much more unbelievable conduct displayed by so-called \u201chumans\u201d everywhere than what any history book reveals.AndoresJanuary 23, 2016 9:08 amYou do know that Churchill killed 6-7 million Indians via starvation right?You do know that Churchill committed genocide against a group of Afrikaaners right? All 28,000 of them?You do know that by the time WW1 ended, Churchill had (directly or indirectly caused the deaths of around 15 million deaths, and the British troops caused 20 \u2013 100 million deaths by spreading the Spanish Flu?No, I didn\u2019t think so.E. HondaMay 15, 2016 11:19 pmThe West/Allies/Britain, America, et al were directly responsible for WWII in the first place. It was the ruthless and greedy manner in which they inflicted extraordinary poverty on the German civilian populace following WWI that engendered the Third Reich and insured Hitler\u2019s message of racial supremacy resonated powerfully with the German people.German children were literally starving on farms! Their families PRODUCED the food but couldn\u2019t afford any of it.Still, the only people to even come close to the Japanese having performed human vivisection, cannibalism, competitive baby bayonneting, forced prostitution of seniors, and weapons testing on random civilians were the Nazis and we don\u2019t cry for their civilians or the bombing/rape of Berlin. We don\u2019t even talk about that.The Japanese were animals during that war. I only feel for the Japanese civilians who didn\u2019t have children in the military, children living at home during the bombing \u2013 and the civilians tormented the world over on account of that war, really. Filipino children too!! 300 Filipino civilians died to this champion boner who couldn\u2019t tell time?The bombs should\u2019ve been dropped on military targets \u2013 not civilians.Still, I don\u2019t think there were any victims in that. The war wasn\u2019t about good vs. evil and none of the cast members were good. It was all causality.BobOctober 31, 2017 12:19 pmI didn\u2019t know Churchill personally took food away from people in India. Were you there to witness this?

Hello, if the word \u201cEnglish\u201d means French, then what is the difference?). Same building(Tang dynasty building code) , same dress , same face. The word Japan itself is invented by the Mandarin.Tom OConnorOctober 26, 2018 12:48 am1. The Chinese word for Japan is \u65e5\u672c (R\u00ecb\u011bn in Pinyin) so you got that wrong.2. \u201cJapanese is Chinese\u201d \u2013 Couldn\u2019t be further from the truth. Their DNA is not in common at all. Also, tell that to the cities of Shanghai and Nanjing\u2026as well as China overall. While true that Japan \u201cstole\u201d many Chinese characters, as they had no writing style of their own, while stealing the characters, in Kanji the meanings and pronunciations of the characters are completely different.3. \u201cThe word English means French\u201d? \u2013 What in the hell does that even mean? In Chinese, English is \u82f1\u6587 (Y\u012bngw\u00e9n in Pinyin) and French is \u6cd5\u8bed (F\u01cey\u01d4 in Pinyin).Kanji is just the name of the Chinese characters that they \u201cstole\u201d from the Chinese.Fabian FragiaoMarch 11, 2018 12:22 amThe bombs despite it\u2019s terrible power helped save perhaps millions upon millions of American, their Allies and Japanese people. The dropping of both bombs was not an experiment but meant to end the war and it did. The story of the Japanese soldier who refused to quit fighting is an indication of what would have happened if the Emperor of Japan did tell these dedicated Japanese soldiers would have done to the invaders. They would have fought any invaders to the death.US Army Veteran station in the Far EastJohnJune 12, 2019 2:14 pmTest nothing\u2026.they started a war committing horrible atrocities and we ended it by kicking their ass.JBMarch 22, 2020 6:51 amNot true, it was the only way the Japenese would stop killing, and it took 2 to get the message across.RayJanuary 8, 2015 8:05 am@LindsayI hate the self righteous attitude of people who blame everything on the Japanese without ever considering (or reading up) on what the Allies did (read up a bit on events after Germany\u2019s defeat- rape, horrific torture and mutilation, bestiality). Yes, the Japanese committed many atrocities in the war (as did the Allies, but of course we never hear about them because after all, \u201chistory is written by the winners\u201d), but why can\u2019t we put that aside for one moment just to praise this man who was only following orders for his dedication and loyalty? Because quite frankly, I think tenacity and dedication is something the youth these days (especially in the USA) are lacking.jamesMay 25, 2015 7:23 amyou have no ideas to the brutality committed by your military.

Hello, if the word \u201cEnglish\u201d means French, then what is the difference?). Same building(Tang dynasty building code) , same dress , same face. The word Japan itself is invented by the Mandarin.Tom OConnorOctober 26, 2018 12:48 am1. The Chinese word for Japan is \u65e5\u672c (R\u00ecb\u011bn in Pinyin) so you got that wrong.2. \u201cJapanese is Chinese\u201d \u2013 Couldn\u2019t be further from the truth. Their DNA is not in common at all. Also, tell that to the cities of Shanghai and Nanjing\u2026as well as China overall. While true that Japan \u201cstole\u201d many Chinese characters, as they had no writing style of their own, while stealing the characters, in Kanji the meanings and pronunciations of the characters are completely different.3. \u201cThe word English means French\u201d? \u2013 What in the hell does that even mean? In Chinese, English is \u82f1\u6587 (Y\u012bngw\u00e9n in Pinyin) and French is \u6cd5\u8bed (F\u01cey\u01d4 in Pinyin).Kanji is just the name of the Chinese characters that they \u201cstole\u201d from the Chinese.Fabian FragiaoMarch 11, 2018 12:22 amThe bombs despite it\u2019s terrible power helped save perhaps millions upon millions of American, their Allies and Japanese people. The dropping of both bombs was not an experiment but meant to end the war and it did. The story of the Japanese soldier who refused to quit fighting is an indication of what would have happened if the Emperor of Japan did tell these dedicated Japanese soldiers would have done to the invaders. They would have fought any invaders to the death.US Army Veteran station in the Far EastJohnJune 12, 2019 2:14 pmTest nothing\u2026.they started a war committing horrible atrocities and we ended it by kicking their ass.JBMarch 22, 2020 6:51 amNot true, it was the only way the Japenese would stop killing, and it took 2 to get the message across.

The fastest way to end the war was to demonstrate the bomb . It only took two bombs to bring the Japanese hawks to their senses. and estimated 30 million people had died fighting the Axis powers in the previous five years, people across the world were sick of war. Had we not used the bomb, it would have entailed a land invasion of the japanese mainland, that would have taken another two years, and another million Allied troops and possibly 10 million japanese would have died. So the death toll from the two bombs, about 100,000 dead, was a cheap price to pay by the japanese to bring it all to and end. Then we get the comments here trying to paint the Allies as the bad guys. Lets just get this clear. The Germans and the Japanese started WW2, and purely to enslave and conquer the world. The Axis power did horrendous things to civilians, from death camps to using them for medical experiments. Another point was to help ensure complete cessation by Russia, it was necessary to demonstrate to Stalin we had the bomb, because the russians were working on the same thing. The credible nuclear deterrent that evolved from the 1945 started the cold war, and prevented all out nuclear war for the next 75 years. Twice in the 20th century America and the UK have been dragged into a world war not of their making and which we did not ask for. And part of the blame for that lies with Japan.

XX Jaycam XXJanuary 22, 2016 3:46 amOne of the single biggest atrocities in human history was America dropping the A bombs on Japan. The amount of unimaginable suffering & death of innocent men, women & children that had no say in the war to begin with was nothing more than a test to see the effects of nuclear devastation on the human populace. There was no excuse for the A bombs to be used & if people think there was then WHY HASN\u2019T IT EVER HAPPENED SINCE. Stop lying to yourselves and everyone & face the truth of murdering innocence, they WERE NOT SOLDIERS, THEY WERE INNOCENT CIVILIANS.txpackfanFebruary 20, 2016 5:10 amI\u2019m not sure what you use to determine atrocities, but the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki weren\u2019t even the largest death tolls by American bombing in Japan. Indeed, the campaign of fire bombing large cities initiated by General LeMay in early 1945 took the lives of hundreds of thousands of civilians. As far as atrocities, I suggest you study the Japanese wartime occupation of Nanking, China before declaring the worst atrocity.As American troops got closer to Japan, Japanese defenses stiffened. On Iwo Jima and Okinawa, entire divisions of Japanese troops died without a single surrender. In some cases the Japanese soldier was not \u201callowed\u201d to die until he had killed at least 4 American soldiers! At this time on the main islands of Japan, every civilian was training and was expected to fight the invading enemy, or die. The Japanese civilian population was completely committed to the war effort, and Japan\u2019s wartime government had rejected all calls for surrender. Some Allied planners estimated that 1 million Allied troops (mostly American) would be lost during the invasion of Japan. Remember, Japan had millions of troops, and thousands of airplanes maintained just for homeland defense. Japan was certainly going to lose the war, but they were going to bleed the Allieds dry doing so.Obviously, President Truman decided to drop the atomic bombs. A full-scale invasion of Japan would\u2019ve resulted in the loss of 10\u2019s of millions of additional people (military and civilian), the inevitable destruction of Japanese monuments, and quite possibly the end of the Japanese civilization as we know it!It ain\u2019t always black and white, my friend.Theblade12July 31, 2016 2:54 pm\u2026Is it not obvious why no more nuclear weapons have been used, beyond testing them at uninhabited areas?Back then, it was probably the largest war ever to be waged by humans.

The fastest way to end the war was to demonstrate the bomb . It only took two bombs to bring the Japanese hawks to their senses. and estimated 30 million people had died fighting the Axis powers in the previous five years, people across the world were sick of war. Had we not used the bomb, it would have entailed a land invasion of the japanese mainland, that would have taken another two years, and another million Allied troops and possibly 10 million japanese would have died. So the death toll from the two bombs, about 100,000 dead, was a cheap price to pay by the japanese to bring it all to and end. Then we get the comments here trying to paint the Allies as the bad guys. Lets just get this clear. The Germans and the Japanese started WW2, and purely to enslave and conquer the world. The Axis power did horrendous things to civilians, from death camps to using them for medical experiments. Another point was to help ensure complete cessation by Russia, it was necessary to demonstrate to Stalin we had the bomb, because the russians were working on the same thing. The credible nuclear deterrent that evolved from the 1945 started the cold war, and prevented all out nuclear war for the next 75 years. Twice in the 20th century America and the UK have been dragged into a world war not of their making and which we did not ask for. And part of the blame for that lies with Japan. They started it, and we finished it, to preserve freedom and democracy.danish baconJanuary 28, 2015 10:38 amDid you know the americans testet nuclearweapons on their own soldiers , up to 5o.ooo persons at one time.RivkaJuly 6, 2015 10:05 pmI do think the bomb was wrong, but does the fact that the USA did wrong things make Japan\u2019s atrocities any better?All groups of human beings are pretty messed up.SomeguyJuly 12, 2015 10:33 amThe Japanese usually would rather fight to the death or kill themselves before they gave up. There is few other countries that are this serious about war. I would rather have dropped a few nuclear bombs than fight that kind of fight all the way to their capital.Miss ChrisJanuary 24, 2020 11:22 pmAny way you look at it, atrocities were committed everywhere, and still are to this day, maybe not at the same measure, but they are\u2026Nobody wins in war\u2026shiuDecember 5, 2015 9:55 pmYou realize they did extensive testing of the bomb and estimates of loss of life based on the current fighting in the Pacific didn\u2019t you? A loss of another 1,000,000 ALLIED lives gone if the war was fought in the conventional way.It\u2019s funny how the U.S. is supposed to be careful in every way to be SURE not take any more Japanese lives than necessary, according to you, yet you say nothing of Pearl Harbor. Oh, stop it. Geesh.ChesterJanuary 2, 2016 2:25 pmThe bombs was not test. It was meant to destroy those Japanese people and factories who indirectly supporting Japanese troops killing innocent people around World at back end. You should be grateful the bomb was invented and used by US 1st, otherwise you might speak Japanese or German by now.But, if you do speak Japanese or German then you should feel lucky that US only drop 2 bombs.XX Jaycam XXJanuary 22, 2016 3:46 amOne of the single biggest atrocities in human history was America dropping the A bombs on Japan. The amount of unimaginable suffering & death of innocent men, women & children that had no say in the war to begin with was nothing more than a test to see the effects of nuclear devastation on the human populace. There was no excuse for the A bombs to be used & if people think there was then WHY HASN\u2019T IT EVER HAPPENED SINCE. Stop lying to yourselves and everyone & face the truth of murdering innocence, they WERE NOT SOLDIERS, THEY WERE INNOCENT CIVILIANS.txpackfanFebruary 20, 2016 5:10 amI\u2019m not sure what you use to determine atrocities, but the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki weren\u2019t even the largest death tolls by American bombing in Japan. Indeed, the campaign of fire bombing large cities initiated by General LeMay in early 1945 took the lives of hundreds of thousands of civilians. As far as atrocities, I suggest you study the Japanese wartime occupation of Nanking, China before declaring the worst atrocity.As American troops got closer to Japan, Japanese defenses stiffened. On Iwo Jima and Okinawa, entire divisions of Japanese troops died without a single surrender. In some cases the Japanese soldier was not \u201callowed\u201d to die until he had killed at least 4 American soldiers! At this time on the main islands of Japan, every civilian was training and was expected to fight the invading enemy, or die. The Japanese civilian population was completely committed to the war effort, and Japan\u2019s wartime government had rejected all calls for surrender. Some Allied planners estimated that 1 million Allied troops (mostly American) would be lost during the invasion of Japan. Remember, Japan had millions of troops, and thousands of airplanes maintained just for homeland defense. Japan was certainly going to lose the war, but they were going to bleed the Allieds dry doing so.Obviously, President Truman decided to drop the atomic bombs. A full-scale invasion of Japan would\u2019ve resulted in the loss of 10\u2019s of millions of additional people (military and civilian), the inevitable destruction of Japanese monuments, and quite possibly the end of the Japanese civilization as we know it!It ain\u2019t always black and white, my friend.Theblade12July 31, 2016 2:54 pm\u2026Is it not obvious why no more nuclear weapons have been used, beyond testing them at uninhabited areas?Back then, it was probably the largest war ever to be waged by humans. The nuclear bombs were used to stop said war. But, if yet another nuclear weapon were to be launched now, while the world is, for the most part, peaceful, what do you think would happen?I\u2019ll answer that question for you.

HondaMay 15, 2016 11:19 pmThe West/Allies/Britain, America, et al were directly responsible for WWII in the first place.

Their families PRODUCED the food but couldn\u2019t afford any of it.Still, the only people to even come close to the Japanese having performed human vivisection, cannibalism, competitive baby bayonneting, forced prostitution of seniors, and weapons testing on random civilians were the Nazis and we don\u2019t cry for their civilians or the bombing/rape of Berlin. We don\u2019t even talk about that.The Japanese were animals during that war. I only feel for the Japanese civilians who didn\u2019t have children in the military, children living at home during the bombing \u2013 and the civilians tormented the world over on account of that war, really. Filipino children too!! 300 Filipino civilians died to this champion boner who couldn\u2019t tell time?The bombs should\u2019ve been dropped on military targets \u2013 not civilians.Still, I don\u2019t think there were any victims in that.

The dropping of both bombs was not an experiment but meant to end the war and it did. The story of the Japanese soldier who refused to quit fighting is an indication of what would have happened if the Emperor of Japan did tell these dedicated Japanese soldiers would have done to the invaders.

Yes, the Japanese committed many atrocities in the war (as did the Allies, but of course we never hear about them because after all, \u201chistory is written by the winners\u201d), but why can\u2019t we put that aside for one moment just to praise this man who was only following orders for his dedication and loyalty? Because quite frankly, I think tenacity and dedication is something the youth these days (especially in the USA) are lacking.jamesMay 25, 2015 7:23 amyou have no ideas to the brutality committed by your military.

The fastest way to end the war was to demonstrate the bomb . It only took two bombs to bring the Japanese hawks to their senses. and estimated 30 million people had died fighting the Axis powers in the previous five years, people across the world were sick of war. Had we not used the bomb, it would have entailed a land invasion of the japanese mainland, that would have taken another two years, and another million Allied troops and possibly 10 million japanese would have died. So the death toll from the two bombs, about 100,000 dead, was a cheap price to pay by the japanese to bring it all to and end. Then we get the comments here trying to paint the Allies as the bad guys. Lets just get this clear. The Germans and the Japanese started WW2, and purely to enslave and conquer the world. The Axis power did horrendous things to civilians, from death camps to using them for medical experiments. Another point was to help ensure complete cessation by Russia, it was necessary to demonstrate to Stalin we had the bomb, because the russians were working on the same thing. The credible nuclear deterrent that evolved from the 1945 started the cold war, and prevented all out nuclear war for the next 75 years. Twice in the 20th century America and the UK have been dragged into a world war not of their making and which we did not ask for. And part of the blame for that lies with Japan. They started it, and we finished it, to preserve freedom and democracy.danish baconJanuary 28, 2015 10:38 amDid you know the americans testet nuclearweapons on their own soldiers , up to 5o.ooo persons at one time.RivkaJuly 6, 2015 10:05 pmI do think the bomb was wrong, but does the fact that the USA did wrong things make Japan\u2019s atrocities any better?All groups of human beings are pretty messed up.SomeguyJuly 12, 2015 10:33 amThe Japanese usually would rather fight to the death or kill themselves before they gave up. There is few other countries that are this serious about war. I would rather have dropped a few nuclear bombs than fight that kind of fight all the way to their capital.Miss ChrisJanuary 24, 2020 11:22 pmAny way you look at it, atrocities were committed everywhere, and still are to this day, maybe not at the same measure, but they are\u2026Nobody wins in war\u2026shiuDecember 5, 2015 9:55 pmYou realize they did extensive testing of the bomb and estimates of loss of life based on the current fighting in the Pacific didn\u2019t you? A loss of another 1,000,000 ALLIED lives gone if the war was fought in the conventional way.It\u2019s funny how the U.S. is supposed to be careful in every way to be SURE not take any more Japanese lives than necessary, according to you, yet you say nothing of Pearl Harbor. Oh, stop it. Geesh.ChesterJanuary 2, 2016 2:25 pmThe bombs was not test. It was meant to destroy those Japanese people and factories who indirectly supporting Japanese troops killing innocent people around World at back end. You should be grateful the bomb was invented and used by US 1st, otherwise you might speak Japanese or German by now.But, if you do speak Japanese or German then you should feel lucky that US only drop 2 bombs.XX Jaycam XXJanuary 22, 2016 3:46 amOne of the single biggest atrocities in human history was America dropping the A bombs on Japan. The amount of unimaginable suffering & death of innocent men, women & children that had no say in the war to begin with was nothing more than a test to see the effects of nuclear devastation on the human populace. There was no excuse for the A bombs to be used & if people think there was then WHY HASN\u2019T IT EVER HAPPENED SINCE. Stop lying to yourselves and everyone & face the truth of murdering innocence, they WERE NOT SOLDIERS, THEY WERE INNOCENT CIVILIANS.txpackfanFebruary 20, 2016 5:10 amI\u2019m not sure what you use to determine atrocities, but the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki weren\u2019t even the largest death tolls by American bombing in Japan. Indeed, the campaign of fire bombing large cities initiated by General LeMay in early 1945 took the lives of hundreds of thousands of civilians. As far as atrocities, I suggest you study the Japanese wartime occupation of Nanking, China before declaring the worst atrocity.As American troops got closer to Japan, Japanese defenses stiffened. On Iwo Jima and Okinawa, entire divisions of Japanese troops died without a single surrender. In some cases the Japanese soldier was not \u201callowed\u201d to die until he had killed at least 4 American soldiers! At this time on the main islands of Japan, every civilian was training and was expected to fight the invading enemy, or die. The Japanese civilian population was completely committed to the war effort, and Japan\u2019s wartime government had rejected all calls for surrender. Some Allied planners estimated that 1 million Allied troops (mostly American) would be lost during the invasion of Japan. Remember, Japan had millions of troops, and thousands of airplanes maintained just for homeland defense. Japan was certainly going to lose the war, but they were going to bleed the Allieds dry doing so.Obviously, President Truman decided to drop the atomic bombs. A full-scale invasion of Japan would\u2019ve resulted in the loss of 10\u2019s of millions of additional people (military and civilian), the inevitable destruction of Japanese monuments, and quite possibly the end of the Japanese civilization as we know it!It ain\u2019t always black and white, my friend.Theblade12July 31, 2016 2:54 pm\u2026Is it not obvious why no more nuclear weapons have been used, beyond testing them at uninhabited areas?Back then, it was probably the largest war ever to be waged by humans. The nuclear bombs were used to stop said war. But, if yet another nuclear weapon were to be launched now, while the world is, for the most part, peaceful, what do you think would happen?I\u2019ll answer that question for you.

Miss ChrisJanuary 24, 2020 11:22 pmAny way you look at it, atrocities were committed everywhere, and still are to this day, maybe not at the same measure, but they are\u2026Nobody wins in war\u2026 Any way you look at it, atrocities were committed everywhere, and still are to this day, maybe not at the same measure, but they are\u2026Nobody wins in war\u2026 shiuDecember 5, 2015 9:55 pmYou realize they did extensive testing of the bomb and estimates of loss of life based on the current fighting in the Pacific didn\u2019t you? A loss of another 1,000,000 ALLIED lives gone if the war was fought in the conventional way.It\u2019s funny how the U.S. is supposed to be careful in every way to be SURE not take any more Japanese lives than necessary, according to you, yet you say nothing of Pearl Harbor. Oh, stop it. Geesh. You realize they did extensive testing of the bomb and estimates of loss of life based on the current fighting in the Pacific didn\u2019t you?

It was meant to destroy those Japanese people and factories who indirectly supporting Japanese troops killing innocent people around World at back end.

XX Jaycam XXJanuary 22, 2016 3:46 amOne of the single biggest atrocities in human history was America dropping the A bombs on Japan. The amount of unimaginable suffering & death of innocent men, women & children that had no say in the war to begin with was nothing more than a test to see the effects of nuclear devastation on the human populace. There was no excuse for the A bombs to be used & if people think there was then WHY HASN\u2019T IT EVER HAPPENED SINCE. Stop lying to yourselves and everyone & face the truth of murdering innocence, they WERE NOT SOLDIERS, THEY WERE INNOCENT CIVILIANS.txpackfanFebruary 20, 2016 5:10 amI\u2019m not sure what you use to determine atrocities, but the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki weren\u2019t even the largest death tolls by American bombing in Japan. Indeed, the campaign of fire bombing large cities initiated by General LeMay in early 1945 took the lives of hundreds of thousands of civilians. As far as atrocities, I suggest you study the Japanese wartime occupation of Nanking, China before declaring the worst atrocity.As American troops got closer to Japan, Japanese defenses stiffened. On Iwo Jima and Okinawa, entire divisions of Japanese troops died without a single surrender. In some cases the Japanese soldier was not \u201callowed\u201d to die until he had killed at least 4 American soldiers! At this time on the main islands of Japan, every civilian was training and was expected to fight the invading enemy, or die. The Japanese civilian population was completely committed to the war effort, and Japan\u2019s wartime government had rejected all calls for surrender. Some Allied planners estimated that 1 million Allied troops (mostly American) would be lost during the invasion of Japan. Remember, Japan had millions of troops, and thousands of airplanes maintained just for homeland defense. Japan was certainly going to lose the war, but they were going to bleed the Allieds dry doing so.Obviously, President Truman decided to drop the atomic bombs. A full-scale invasion of Japan would\u2019ve resulted in the loss of 10\u2019s of millions of additional people (military and civilian), the inevitable destruction of Japanese monuments, and quite possibly the end of the Japanese civilization as we know it!It ain\u2019t always black and white, my friend.Theblade12July 31, 2016 2:54 pm\u2026Is it not obvious why no more nuclear weapons have been used, beyond testing them at uninhabited areas?Back then, it was probably the largest war ever to be waged by humans. The nuclear bombs were used to stop said war. But, if yet another nuclear weapon were to be launched now, while the world is, for the most part, peaceful, what do you think would happen?I\u2019ll answer that question for you.

David HoweApril 10, 2018 7:58 amJapanese women have three lovely tight wet holes \u2013 for passing urine, passing stools and making love Japanese women have three lovely tight wet holes \u2013 for passing urine, passing stools and making love You do know about the Japanese human experimentation and atrocities and the chinese rape right? shameNovember 20, 2014 6:18 amYou do know that USA tested their atomic weapons on Japanese civilians, right?fifiwerekingDecember 31, 2014 12:25 pmthe us dropped the bomb and ended the war\u2026 different reports give different numbers, but it is estimated that by dropping the bomb that ended the war saved about 500,000 american lives, and about 10 million japanese lives\u2026.TheStudentJanuary 5, 2015 8:10 amDid you know the US didn\u2019t have to drop the bomb, it was clear they lost at that point.WWII_FanaticJanuary 20, 2015 10:11 am@TheStudentWait, I thought that even if the Japanese knew that they are losing, they still wouldn\u2019t give up without giving a fight because Japanese soldiers were known for doing that back in WWII.I thought that with the atomic bomb, it basically was a weapon of mass terror as it can instantly kill a city or well, do so much damage that the Japanese were afraid that the US had so many that it would be very very logical just to give up as opposed to still having some chance when fighting conventionally?Janince YuMay 18, 2015 12:16 pmYou know nothing about the black rain atomic bomb and tortured and melted innocent people and continued to kill people even after the war was over because of the severe radiation.Just a bunch of assumptions, predictions and excuses as if that was the only way and the only answer.Steve BrandrickJune 23, 2020 1:24 pmStupid children making comments about stuff they have no experience of. The fastest way to end the war was to demonstrate the bomb . It only took two bombs to bring the Japanese hawks to their senses. and estimated 30 million people had died fighting the Axis powers in the previous five years, people across the world were sick of war. Had we not used the bomb, it would have entailed a land invasion of the japanese mainland, that would have taken another two years, and another million Allied troops and possibly 10 million japanese would have died. So the death toll from the two bombs, about 100,000 dead, was a cheap price to pay by the japanese to bring it all to and end. Then we get the comments here trying to paint the Allies as the bad guys. Lets just get this clear. The Germans and the Japanese started WW2, and purely to enslave and conquer the world. The Axis power did horrendous things to civilians, from death camps to using them for medical experiments. Another point was to help ensure complete cessation by Russia, it was necessary to demonstrate to Stalin we had the bomb, because the russians were working on the same thing. The credible nuclear deterrent that evolved from the 1945 started the cold war, and prevented all out nuclear war for the next 75 years. Twice in the 20th century America and the UK have been dragged into a world war not of their making and which we did not ask for. And part of the blame for that lies with Japan. They started it, and we finished it, to preserve freedom and democracy.danish baconJanuary 28, 2015 10:38 amDid you know the americans testet nuclearweapons on their own soldiers , up to 5o.ooo persons at one time.RivkaJuly 6, 2015 10:05 pmI do think the bomb was wrong, but does the fact that the USA did wrong things make Japan\u2019s atrocities any better?All groups of human beings are pretty messed up.SomeguyJuly 12, 2015 10:33 amThe Japanese usually would rather fight to the death or kill themselves before they gave up. There is few other countries that are this serious about war. I would rather have dropped a few nuclear bombs than fight that kind of fight all the way to their capital.Miss ChrisJanuary 24, 2020 11:22 pmAny way you look at it, atrocities were committed everywhere, and still are to this day, maybe not at the same measure, but they are\u2026Nobody wins in war\u2026shiuDecember 5, 2015 9:55 pmYou realize they did extensive testing of the bomb and estimates of loss of life based on the current fighting in the Pacific didn\u2019t you? A loss of another 1,000,000 ALLIED lives gone if the war was fought in the conventional way.It\u2019s funny how the U.S. is supposed to be careful in every way to be SURE not take any more Japanese lives than necessary, according to you, yet you say nothing of Pearl Harbor. Oh, stop it. Geesh.ChesterJanuary 2, 2016 2:25 pmThe bombs was not test. It was meant to destroy those Japanese people and factories who indirectly supporting Japanese troops killing innocent people around World at back end. You should be grateful the bomb was invented and used by US 1st, otherwise you might speak Japanese or German by now.But, if you do speak Japanese or German then you should feel lucky that US only drop 2 bombs.XX Jaycam XXJanuary 22, 2016 3:46 amOne of the single biggest atrocities in human history was America dropping the A bombs on Japan. The amount of unimaginable suffering & death of innocent men, women & children that had no say in the war to begin with was nothing more than a test to see the effects of nuclear devastation on the human populace. There was no excuse for the A bombs to be used & if people think there was then WHY HASN\u2019T IT EVER HAPPENED SINCE. Stop lying to yourselves and everyone & face the truth of murdering innocence, they WERE NOT SOLDIERS, THEY WERE INNOCENT CIVILIANS.txpackfanFebruary 20, 2016 5:10 amI\u2019m not sure what you use to determine atrocities, but the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki weren\u2019t even the largest death tolls by American bombing in Japan. Indeed, the campaign of fire bombing large cities initiated by General LeMay in early 1945 took the lives of hundreds of thousands of civilians. As far as atrocities, I suggest you study the Japanese wartime occupation of Nanking, China before declaring the worst atrocity.As American troops got closer to Japan, Japanese defenses stiffened. On Iwo Jima and Okinawa, entire divisions of Japanese troops died without a single surrender. In some cases the Japanese soldier was not \u201callowed\u201d to die until he had killed at least 4 American soldiers! At this time on the main islands of Japan, every civilian was training and was expected to fight the invading enemy, or die. The Japanese civilian population was completely committed to the war effort, and Japan\u2019s wartime government had rejected all calls for surrender. Some Allied planners estimated that 1 million Allied troops (mostly American) would be lost during the invasion of Japan. Remember, Japan had millions of troops, and thousands of airplanes maintained just for homeland defense. Japan was certainly going to lose the war, but they were going to bleed the Allieds dry doing so.Obviously, President Truman decided to drop the atomic bombs. A full-scale invasion of Japan would\u2019ve resulted in the loss of 10\u2019s of millions of additional people (military and civilian), the inevitable destruction of Japanese monuments, and quite possibly the end of the Japanese civilization as we know it!It ain\u2019t always black and white, my friend.Theblade12July 31, 2016 2:54 pm\u2026Is it not obvious why no more nuclear weapons have been used, beyond testing them at uninhabited areas?Back then, it was probably the largest war ever to be waged by humans. The nuclear bombs were used to stop said war. But, if yet another nuclear weapon were to be launched now, while the world is, for the most part, peaceful, what do you think would happen?I\u2019ll answer that question for you. What would surely grow to become world war three would start.Millions would die, once again, but this time, not for the sake of peace, but for the sake of war.razJuly 3, 2018 7:05 amit seems people want to believe what ever they want to but when you think of japan back in those days before giving up to the Americans you need to know that all the major cities of japan were already wiped of the map and there was no communications left so headquarters did not know that the Americans had even dropped the bombs so your assertion that the atom bomb ended the war is wrong \u2013 the Japs capitulated because the news that Stalin had jumped there border was what actually ended the war Trueman wanted to show the Ruskies he was the one with the ace up the sleeve and to not screw with the American Gov\u2019t \u2013 russia wanted the spoils of japan too \u2013 don\u2019t believe me though find out yourself \u2013ClaytonDecember 5, 2018 5:32 amAs Christopher Titus said: To the Japanese People, I will admit that (we) overreacted, but hey, you started it.Miss ChrisJanuary 24, 2020 11:40 pmAnother was the Holocaust-and there is so much more unbelievable conduct displayed by so-called \u201chumans\u201d everywhere than what any history book reveals.AndoresJanuary 23, 2016 9:08 amYou do know that Churchill killed 6-7 million Indians via starvation right?You do know that Churchill committed genocide against a group of Afrikaaners right? All 28,000 of them?You do know that by the time WW1 ended, Churchill had (directly or indirectly caused the deaths of around 15 million deaths, and the British troops caused 20 \u2013 100 million deaths by spreading the Spanish Flu?No, I didn\u2019t think so.E. HondaMay 15, 2016 11:19 pmThe West/Allies/Britain, America, et al were directly responsible for WWII in the first place. It was the ruthless and greedy manner in which they inflicted extraordinary poverty on the German civilian populace following WWI that engendered the Third Reich and insured Hitler\u2019s message of racial supremacy resonated powerfully with the German people.German children were literally starving on farms! Their families PRODUCED the food but couldn\u2019t afford any of it.Still, the only people to even come close to the Japanese having performed human vivisection, cannibalism, competitive baby bayonneting, forced prostitution of seniors, and weapons testing on random civilians were the Nazis and we don\u2019t cry for their civilians or the bombing/rape of Berlin. We don\u2019t even talk about that.The Japanese were animals during that war. I only feel for the Japanese civilians who didn\u2019t have children in the military, children living at home during the bombing \u2013 and the civilians tormented the world over on account of that war, really. Filipino children too!! 300 Filipino civilians died to this champion boner who couldn\u2019t tell time?The bombs should\u2019ve been dropped on military targets \u2013 not civilians.Still, I don\u2019t think there were any victims in that. The war wasn\u2019t about good vs. evil and none of the cast members were good. It was all causality.BobOctober 31, 2017 12:19 pmI didn\u2019t know Churchill personally took food away from people in India. Were you there to witness this? One man cannot personally starve millions.Mathew MolkJune 1, 2016 4:58 pmYou revisionist Historian clown.Tested? \u2013 We \u201cTested\u201d fire bombs on Tokyo too, Trying to win WW II.But then Jap civilians who beat and killed GI POWs were only \u201ctesting\u201d tooWhat about the Batman Death March ? That was one hell of a test.Was Yamamoto just \u201cTesting\u201d bombs on the civilians that were killed in the Pearl Harbor sneak attack?Supposed you never heard of Gen. Ishi\u2019s \u201cLogs\u201d either.Compared to the Jap military Hitler\u2019s SS we kindly boy scouts.You got to be on drugs.NekobasuApril 21, 2018 8:15 pmTell me more about this \u201cBatman Death March\u201d. Did Superman have anything to say about it?John Curtis GibsonDecember 18, 2017 3:40 pmJapanese is Chinese. Same language writing (Kanji means Chinese. Hello, if the word \u201cEnglish\u201d means French, then what is the difference?). Same building(Tang dynasty building code) , same dress , same face. The word Japan itself is invented by the Mandarin.Tom OConnorOctober 26, 2018 12:48 am1. The Chinese word for Japan is \u65e5\u672c (R\u00ecb\u011bn in Pinyin) so you got that wrong.2. \u201cJapanese is Chinese\u201d \u2013 Couldn\u2019t be further from the truth. Their DNA is not in common at all. Also, tell that to the cities of Shanghai and Nanjing\u2026as well as China overall. While true that Japan \u201cstole\u201d many Chinese characters, as they had no writing style of their own, while stealing the characters, in Kanji the meanings and pronunciations of the characters are completely different.3. \u201cThe word English means French\u201d? \u2013 What in the hell does that even mean? In Chinese, English is \u82f1\u6587 (Y\u012bngw\u00e9n in Pinyin) and French is \u6cd5\u8bed (F\u01cey\u01d4 in Pinyin).Kanji is just the name of the Chinese characters that they \u201cstole\u201d from the Chinese.Fabian FragiaoMarch 11, 2018 12:22 amThe bombs despite it\u2019s terrible power helped save perhaps millions upon millions of American, their Allies and Japanese people. The dropping of both bombs was not an experiment but meant to end the war and it did. The story of the Japanese soldier who refused to quit fighting is an indication of what would have happened if the Emperor of Japan did tell these dedicated Japanese soldiers would have done to the invaders.

Japan was certainly going to lose the war, but they were going to bleed the Allieds dry doing so.Obviously, President Truman decided to drop the atomic bombs. A full-scale invasion of Japan would\u2019ve resulted in the loss of 10\u2019s of millions of additional people (military and civilian), the inevitable destruction of Japanese monuments, and quite possibly the end of the Japanese civilization as we know it!It ain\u2019t always black and white, my friend. I\u2019m not sure what you use to determine atrocities, but the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki weren\u2019t even the largest death tolls by American bombing in Japan. Indeed, the campaign of fire bombing large cities initiated by General LeMay in early 1945 took the lives of hundreds of thousands of civilians. As far as atrocities, I suggest you study the Japanese wartime occupation of Nanking, China before declaring the worst atrocity.As American troops got closer to Japan, Japanese defenses stiffened. On Iwo Jima and Okinawa, entire divisions of Japanese troops died without a single surrender. In some cases the Japanese soldier was not \u201callowed\u201d to die until he had killed at least 4 American soldiers! At this time on the main islands of Japan, every civilian was training and was expected to fight the invading enemy, or die. The Japanese civilian population was completely committed to the war effort, and Japan\u2019s wartime government had rejected all calls for surrender.

Theblade12July 31, 2016 2:54 pm\u2026Is it not obvious why no more nuclear weapons have been used, beyond testing them at uninhabited areas?Back then, it was probably the largest war ever to be waged by humans. The nuclear bombs were used to stop said war. But, if yet another nuclear weapon were to be launched now, while the world is, for the most part, peaceful, what do you think would happen?I\u2019ll answer that question for you. What would surely grow to become world war three would start.Millions would die, once again, but this time, not for the sake of peace, but for the sake of war. \u2026Is it not obvious why no more nuclear weapons have been used, beyond testing them at uninhabited areas?

Twice in the 20th century America and the UK have been dragged into a world war not of their making and which we did not ask for. And part of the blame for that lies with Japan. They started it, and we finished it, to preserve freedom and democracy. Stupid children making comments about stuff they have no experience of. The fastest way to end the war was to demonstrate the bomb . It only took two bombs to bring the Japanese hawks to their senses. and estimated 30 million people had died fighting the Axis powers in the previous five years, people across the world were sick of war. Had we not used the bomb, it would have entailed a land invasion of the japanese mainland, that would have taken another two years, and another million Allied troops and possibly 10 million japanese would have died. So the death toll from the two bombs, about 100,000 dead, was a cheap price to pay by the japanese to bring it all to and end. Then we get the comments here trying to paint the Allies as the bad guys. Lets just get this clear. The Germans and the Japanese started WW2, and purely to enslave and conquer the world. The Axis power did horrendous things to civilians, from death camps to using them for medical experiments.

A loss of another 1,000,000 ALLIED lives gone if the war was fought in the conventional way.It\u2019s funny how the U.S. is supposed to be careful in every way to be SURE not take any more Japanese lives than necessary, according to you, yet you say nothing of Pearl Harbor.

The amount of unimaginable suffering & death of innocent men, women & children that had no say in the war to begin with was nothing more than a test to see the effects of nuclear devastation on the human populace. There was no excuse for the A bombs to be used & if people think there was then WHY HASN\u2019T IT EVER HAPPENED SINCE. Stop lying to yourselves and everyone & face the truth of murdering innocence, they WERE NOT SOLDIERS, THEY WERE INNOCENT CIVILIANS.txpackfanFebruary 20, 2016 5:10 amI\u2019m not sure what you use to determine atrocities, but the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki weren\u2019t even the largest death tolls by American bombing in Japan. Indeed, the campaign of fire bombing large cities initiated by General LeMay in early 1945 took the lives of hundreds of thousands of civilians. As far as atrocities, I suggest you study the Japanese wartime occupation of Nanking, China before declaring the worst atrocity.As American troops got closer to Japan, Japanese defenses stiffened. On Iwo Jima and Okinawa, entire divisions of Japanese troops died without a single surrender. In some cases the Japanese soldier was not \u201callowed\u201d to die until he had killed at least 4 American soldiers! At this time on the main islands of Japan, every civilian was training and was expected to fight the invading enemy, or die. The Japanese civilian population was completely committed to the war effort, and Japan\u2019s wartime government had rejected all calls for surrender. Some Allied planners estimated that 1 million Allied troops (mostly American) would be lost during the invasion of Japan. Remember, Japan had millions of troops, and thousands of airplanes maintained just for homeland defense. Japan was certainly going to lose the war, but they were going to bleed the Allieds dry doing so.Obviously, President Truman decided to drop the atomic bombs. A full-scale invasion of Japan would\u2019ve resulted in the loss of 10\u2019s of millions of additional people (military and civilian), the inevitable destruction of Japanese monuments, and quite possibly the end of the Japanese civilization as we know it!It ain\u2019t always black and white, my friend.Theblade12July 31, 2016 2:54 pm\u2026Is it not obvious why no more nuclear weapons have been used, beyond testing them at uninhabited areas?Back then, it was probably the largest war ever to be waged by humans.

AndoresJanuary 23, 2016 9:08 amYou do know that Churchill killed 6-7 million Indians via starvation right?You do know that Churchill committed genocide against a group of Afrikaaners right? All 28,000 of them?You do know that by the time WW1 ended, Churchill had (directly or indirectly caused the deaths of around 15 million deaths, and the British troops caused 20 \u2013 100 million deaths by spreading the Spanish Flu?No, I didn\u2019t think so.E. HondaMay 15, 2016 11:19 pmThe West/Allies/Britain, America, et al were directly responsible for WWII in the first place. It was the ruthless and greedy manner in which they inflicted extraordinary poverty on the German civilian populace following WWI that engendered the Third Reich and insured Hitler\u2019s message of racial supremacy resonated powerfully with the German people.German children were literally starving on farms! Their families PRODUCED the food but couldn\u2019t afford any of it.Still, the only people to even come close to the Japanese having performed human vivisection, cannibalism, competitive baby bayonneting, forced prostitution of seniors, and weapons testing on random civilians were the Nazis and we don\u2019t cry for their civilians or the bombing/rape of Berlin. We don\u2019t even talk about that.The Japanese were animals during that war. I only feel for the Japanese civilians who didn\u2019t have children in the military, children living at home during the bombing \u2013 and the civilians tormented the world over on account of that war, really. Filipino children too!! 300 Filipino civilians died to this champion boner who couldn\u2019t tell time?The bombs should\u2019ve been dropped on military targets \u2013 not civilians.Still, I don\u2019t think there were any victims in that. The war wasn\u2019t about good vs. evil and none of the cast members were good. It was all causality.BobOctober 31, 2017 12:19 pmI didn\u2019t know Churchill personally took food away from people in India. Were you there to witness this?

BombsJuly 6, 2010 9:38 amIf they didn\u2019t drop the bombs, there would have been more casualties on both sides. Its just basic logic. Also, more people died in the firebombing that preceded the atomic bombs, many of which where civilians. People who usually go crazy about the atomic bombs have a very superficial view of history during that period.GeoffSeptember 26, 2013 7:11 amThere is nothing commendable about his supposed self-sacrifice, he was a victim of intense pre-war propaganda and his refusal to surrender simply shows the power of his indoctrination. The article is full of references to the inability of the soldiers to think for themselves, to use their own reason, such a handicap is never praiseworthy. He was a victim of a fascist-style government and he in turn victimized innocent people. The lesson here is that blind approval of military culture is incredibly dangerous, a lesson that we Americans used to understand, but seem to have lost.For the poster of the comment who claimed that the civilian slaughter in Hiroshima and Nagasaki were somehow justified because the US wasn\u2019t forced to invade, you\u2019re the one with the shallow view of history. There are plenty of documents showing that Japan was ready to surrender before the bombs and was very actively trying to surrender after Hiroshima. They had approached the Soviets and asked them to act as intermediaries, but it takes time for an empire to surrender; instead of allowing for the diplomatic wheels to turn we simply slaughtered another city full of civilians.There are various theories about why we dropped the bombs, from what I\u2019ve read I think it\u2019s most likely that we were attempting to demonstrate our power to the Soviet Union. Under that scenario, dropping the second bomb would be necessary to show that we were able to mass produce the weapons, something thought impossible by many countries at the time.When the bomb dropped, the Soviets had already declared war on Japan and invaded their holdings in mainland Asia. This was at the behest of the American government, who gave concessions in Europe to ensure Soviet help against Japan. Then, after securing their help and allowing vast swaths of territory to fall under Soviet control and domination, we use nuclear weapons on civilian and end the war without them. The Korean war and the enslavement of the North Korean people is a direct result of that blunder.gizzyOctober 23, 2013 2:11 pmThe bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were fully justified. Why did the Japanese wait 3 days after the Hiroshima destruction to finally surrender? They knew the horrible power of the first bomb, yet they still did not want to surrender until Hirohito decided it was time to end the war and surrender.SpencerOctober 27, 2013 8:59 pmUmm, apparently the whole thing was a misunderstanding/bad translation. The guy on the Japanese side said that they needed time to decide, but the verb they used had an alternate meeting of \u201cno\u201d or something. The translator didn\u2019t clarify/think of a broader context before translating, so us Americans assumed they were being staid/proud Japanese people who were refusing to bow.

My friends father was trained as a Kamikaze pilot. The war ended right before he was sent to battle. Yet, my friend did not realize that the Atomic Bomb had made it possible for him to be born.shiuDecember 5, 2015 9:59 pmMaybe the U.S. should have dropped the bomb and not made any deals with Russia so the Russian grabbed territory would have anjoyed the economic prosperity that Japan did later on. Oh Well.mmhOctober 11, 2013 6:33 pmThe abombs where just a convenient excuse. Stalin had just turned against them too, which really doomed their whole strategy. They where already loosing 20-30 Nagasaki type cities a day at that point. Impressive as it was technically, at that point the US was pummeling them so hard they we would be landing on Japan proper soon, and the Russians would be too via arming the Chinese (who also hated Japan).paulMarch 11, 2014 5:00 amDropping the bombs were not necessary the japanese were going to surrender because they know they\u2019re going to lose. USA bombed japan to show other powerful countries that they\u2019re the most powerful and that they\u2019re untouchable. \u201cwe just killed thousand of innocent people, fear us russia!\u201d If they didn\u2019t drop the bombs, there would have been more casualties on both sides. Its just basic logic. Also, more people died in the firebombing that preceded the atomic bombs, many of which where civilians. People who usually go crazy about the atomic bombs have a very superficial view of history during that period. GeoffSeptember 26, 2013 7:11 amThere is nothing commendable about his supposed self-sacrifice, he was a victim of intense pre-war propaganda and his refusal to surrender simply shows the power of his indoctrination. The article is full of references to the inability of the soldiers to think for themselves, to use their own reason, such a handicap is never praiseworthy. He was a victim of a fascist-style government and he in turn victimized innocent people. The lesson here is that blind approval of military culture is incredibly dangerous, a lesson that we Americans used to understand, but seem to have lost.For the poster of the comment who claimed that the civilian slaughter in Hiroshima and Nagasaki were somehow justified because the US wasn\u2019t forced to invade, you\u2019re the one with the shallow view of history. There are plenty of documents showing that Japan was ready to surrender before the bombs and was very actively trying to surrender after Hiroshima. They had approached the Soviets and asked them to act as intermediaries, but it takes time for an empire to surrender; instead of allowing for the diplomatic wheels to turn we simply slaughtered another city full of civilians.There are various theories about why we dropped the bombs, from what I\u2019ve read I think it\u2019s most likely that we were attempting to demonstrate our power to the Soviet Union. Under that scenario, dropping the second bomb would be necessary to show that we were able to mass produce the weapons, something thought impossible by many countries at the time.When the bomb dropped, the Soviets had already declared war on Japan and invaded their holdings in mainland Asia. This was at the behest of the American government, who gave concessions in Europe to ensure Soviet help against Japan. Then, after securing their help and allowing vast swaths of territory to fall under Soviet control and domination, we use nuclear weapons on civilian and end the war without them. The Korean war and the enslavement of the North Korean people is a direct result of that blunder.gizzyOctober 23, 2013 2:11 pmThe bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were fully justified. Why did the Japanese wait 3 days after the Hiroshima destruction to finally surrender? They knew the horrible power of the first bomb, yet they still did not want to surrender until Hirohito decided it was time to end the war and surrender.SpencerOctober 27, 2013 8:59 pmUmm, apparently the whole thing was a misunderstanding/bad translation. The guy on the Japanese side said that they needed time to decide, but the verb they used had an alternate meeting of \u201cno\u201d or something. The translator didn\u2019t clarify/think of a broader context before translating, so us Americans assumed they were being staid/proud Japanese people who were refusing to bow.

After WWII, through our foreign policy, we became worldwide tyrants and murderers.\u201d, which shows that you are awake/aware, that you are obviously not properly indoctrinated, and that you have been reading real, recorded history.

MikeJanuary 31, 2015 11:09 amThe estimated casualties for an invasion of the Japanese mainland was 1,000,000 US men wounded or killed! The invasion would have dwarfed the Normandy D-Day landing. Many people think the Japanese had their own nuclear program, and that possibly it was over run by the Russians. If any of the Axis powers had had a nuclear weapon they would have used it. Revisionist history professors have really lied to many students. The Japanese didn\u2019t surrender after the first atomic bomb was dropped, and the second one finally convinced them to surrender. Read, read, read! Don\u2019t rely on biased teachers who spread more lies then Goebbels. The estimated casualties for an invasion of the Japanese mainland was 1,000,000 US men wounded or killed!

They where already loosing 20-30 Nagasaki type cities a day at that point. Impressive as it was technically, at that point the US was pummeling them so hard they we would be landing on Japan proper soon, and the Russians would be too via arming the Chinese (who also hated Japan).

Its just basic logic. Also, more people died in the firebombing that preceded the atomic bombs, many of which where civilians. People who usually go crazy about the atomic bombs have a very superficial view of history during that period. GeoffSeptember 26, 2013 7:11 amThere is nothing commendable about his supposed self-sacrifice, he was a victim of intense pre-war propaganda and his refusal to surrender simply shows the power of his indoctrination. The article is full of references to the inability of the soldiers to think for themselves, to use their own reason, such a handicap is never praiseworthy. He was a victim of a fascist-style government and he in turn victimized innocent people. The lesson here is that blind approval of military culture is incredibly dangerous, a lesson that we Americans used to understand, but seem to have lost.For the poster of the comment who claimed that the civilian slaughter in Hiroshima and Nagasaki were somehow justified because the US wasn\u2019t forced to invade, you\u2019re the one with the shallow view of history. There are plenty of documents showing that Japan was ready to surrender before the bombs and was very actively trying to surrender after Hiroshima. They had approached the Soviets and asked them to act as intermediaries, but it takes time for an empire to surrender; instead of allowing for the diplomatic wheels to turn we simply slaughtered another city full of civilians.There are various theories about why we dropped the bombs, from what I\u2019ve read I think it\u2019s most likely that we were attempting to demonstrate our power to the Soviet Union. Under that scenario, dropping the second bomb would be necessary to show that we were able to mass produce the weapons, something thought impossible by many countries at the time.When the bomb dropped, the Soviets had already declared war on Japan and invaded their holdings in mainland Asia. This was at the behest of the American government, who gave concessions in Europe to ensure Soviet help against Japan. Then, after securing their help and allowing vast swaths of territory to fall under Soviet control and domination, we use nuclear weapons on civilian and end the war without them. The Korean war and the enslavement of the North Korean people is a direct result of that blunder.gizzyOctober 23, 2013 2:11 pmThe bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were fully justified. Why did the Japanese wait 3 days after the Hiroshima destruction to finally surrender? They knew the horrible power of the first bomb, yet they still did not want to surrender until Hirohito decided it was time to end the war and surrender.SpencerOctober 27, 2013 8:59 pmUmm, apparently the whole thing was a misunderstanding/bad translation. The guy on the Japanese side said that they needed time to decide, but the verb they used had an alternate meeting of \u201cno\u201d or something. The translator didn\u2019t clarify/think of a broader context before translating, so us Americans assumed they were being staid/proud Japanese people who were refusing to bow. Of course, there are probably more sides than simply this one, but also more than just \u201cdude, they totally knew there was going to be another bomb\u201d. I mean, you have to realize the benefit of hindsight. At the time, there were probably a shitton of mixed reports, chaos, and terror. Military/government facilities had been bombed/firebombed, people (in important roles) had died, etc. It\u2019s kind of a big thing to tell someone they need to give up their entire way of life, depose a man they considered a living god, and surrender to people they\u2019d been told/said were idiotic, honorless foreigners.FaraAugust 22, 2014 4:27 amThis guy was a cog in the devilish Japanese war machine.The people who ran the unit 731,for example,must have been pretty dedicated to their \u201ccause\u201d too.In my opinion, the US did not have an alternative to dropping atom bombs,atleast not one apparent back then.It is sad that a lot of innocent civilians died,mainly the children,who certainly were not a part of the war,but I do not feel sorry for Japan as a nation state,the fact that there are shrines dedicated to killed war criminals,and seeing how many of the worst are still revered as heroes,makes one wonder about the Japenese national character.

MikeJanuary 31, 2015 11:09 amThe estimated casualties for an invasion of the Japanese mainland was 1,000,000 US men wounded or killed! The invasion would have dwarfed the Normandy D-Day landing. Many people think the Japanese had their own nuclear program, and that possibly it was over run by the Russians. If any of the Axis powers had had a nuclear weapon they would have used it. Revisionist history professors have really lied to many students. The Japanese didn\u2019t surrender after the first atomic bomb was dropped, and the second one finally convinced them to surrender. Read, read, read! Don\u2019t rely on biased teachers who spread more lies then Goebbels. The estimated casualties for an invasion of the Japanese mainland was 1,000,000 US men wounded or killed!

Oh Well. Maybe the U.S. should have dropped the bomb and not made any deals with Russia so the Russian grabbed territory would have anjoyed the economic prosperity that Japan did later on. Oh Well. There is nothing commendable about his supposed self-sacrifice, he was a victim of intense pre-war propaganda and his refusal to surrender simply shows the power of his indoctrination. The article is full of references to the inability of the soldiers to think for themselves, to use their own reason, such a handicap is never praiseworthy. He was a victim of a fascist-style government and he in turn victimized innocent people. The lesson here is that blind approval of military culture is incredibly dangerous, a lesson that we Americans used to understand, but seem to have lost. For the poster of the comment who claimed that the civilian slaughter in Hiroshima and Nagasaki were somehow justified because the US wasn\u2019t forced to invade, you\u2019re the one with the shallow view of history. There are plenty of documents showing that Japan was ready to surrender before the bombs and was very actively trying to surrender after Hiroshima. They had approached the Soviets and asked them to act as intermediaries, but it takes time for an empire to surrender; instead of allowing for the diplomatic wheels to turn we simply slaughtered another city full of civilians. There are various theories about why we dropped the bombs, from what I\u2019ve read I think it\u2019s most likely that we were attempting to demonstrate our power to the Soviet Union. Under that scenario, dropping the second bomb would be necessary to show that we were able to mass produce the weapons, something thought impossible by many countries at the time. When the bomb dropped, the Soviets had already declared war on Japan and invaded their holdings in mainland Asia. This was at the behest of the American government, who gave concessions in Europe to ensure Soviet help against Japan. Then, after securing their help and allowing vast swaths of territory to fall under Soviet control and domination, we use nuclear weapons on civilian and end the war without them. The Korean war and the enslavement of the North Korean people is a direct result of that blunder. gizzyOctober 23, 2013 2:11 pmThe bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were fully justified. Why did the Japanese wait 3 days after the Hiroshima destruction to finally surrender? They knew the horrible power of the first bomb, yet they still did not want to surrender until Hirohito decided it was time to end the war and surrender.SpencerOctober 27, 2013 8:59 pmUmm, apparently the whole thing was a misunderstanding/bad translation. The guy on the Japanese side said that they needed time to decide, but the verb they used had an alternate meeting of \u201cno\u201d or something. The translator didn\u2019t clarify/think of a broader context before translating, so us Americans assumed they were being staid/proud Japanese people who were refusing to bow. Of course, there are probably more sides than simply this one, but also more than just \u201cdude, they totally knew there was going to be another bomb\u201d. I mean, you have to realize the benefit of hindsight. At the time, there were probably a shitton of mixed reports, chaos, and terror. Military/government facilities had been bombed/firebombed, people (in important roles) had died, etc. It\u2019s kind of a big thing to tell someone they need to give up their entire way of life, depose a man they considered a living god, and surrender to people they\u2019d been told/said were idiotic, honorless foreigners.FaraAugust 22, 2014 4:27 amThis guy was a cog in the devilish Japanese war machine.The people who ran the unit 731,for example,must have been pretty dedicated to their \u201ccause\u201d too.In my opinion, the US did not have an alternative to dropping atom bombs,atleast not one apparent back then.It is sad that a lot of innocent civilians died,mainly the children,who certainly were not a part of the war,but I do not feel sorry for Japan as a nation state,the fact that there are shrines dedicated to killed war criminals,and seeing how many of the worst are still revered as heroes,makes one wonder about the Japenese national character.

The invasion would have dwarfed the Normandy D-Day landing. Many people think the Japanese had their own nuclear program, and that possibly it was over run by the Russians. If any of the Axis powers had had a nuclear weapon they would have used it. Revisionist history professors have really lied to many students.

According to a documentary I watched, we dropped the bombs because Japan was turning their entire island of Japan into a death trap like Iwo Jima, and they were prepared to suicide-bomb their women and children against our troops out of spite.

War is hell, get over the fact that the US won; and you feel guilty because you could never have the courage that the greatest generation did. If you are so ashamed of our proud American peacemaking heritage, LEAVE. I bet there are plenty in the middle east that would be happy to have you. The firebombings of Dresden and other Nazi cities killed more civilians than the 2 atom bombs did. The Japanese civilians were NOT innocent civilians during WWII. When the US occupied the mainland, they discovered stockpiles of weapons stored in elementary schools. Every civilian was expected to fight the Allies on Japanese soil. Meaning, the civilian populice was an extension of the military. But, with your liberal ideology, I guess you would have been more pleased with 2,000,000 American casualities and millions more Japanese dead with a land invasion of Japan in the Fall of 1945.

MikeAugust 12, 2011 4:42 pmThis past spring I was substitute teaching at a Phoenix, Arizona high school. We had no lesson plan, so I was just talking to the class full of seniors, getting ready to graduate. We got on the subject of serial killers, which led me to compare Hitler, Mussolini and Hirohito to having the mindset of serial killers but it\u2019s really more like mass murderers. Two girls shouted me down, defending Hirohito and Japan. The class got into a debate and I asked the girls where did they learn their history? They were not backing down from their Anti-American views and accused Americans of killing innocent Japanese and accusing me of being racist against all Asians. Considering there is over 50 countries and cultures in Asia, I\u2019m not which Asians I am racist against. I actually thought the issue was dead but on the way home I received a call from the young, never been anywhere or done anything for this country vice principal, telling me the two girls filed a complaint stating I was a racist and they were somewhat traumatized. Well, I am a 60 year old Vietnam Infantry Veteran, that almost died from injuries suffered the day before my 19th birthday. My father and uncles all fought for America in the Pacific Islands but I was told I could never earn any money at that school because I was banned from subbing there.Not for telling lies, what I said was true, but because these two 17-18 year old girls were too young to hear the truth! How about that? Only in America!One more incident report and I will be fired from the school district.

They were not backing down from their Anti-American views and accused Americans of killing innocent Japanese and accusing me of being racist against all Asians. Considering there is over 50 countries and cultures in Asia, I\u2019m not which Asians I am racist against. I actually thought the issue was dead but on the way home I received a call from the young, never been anywhere or done anything for this country vice principal, telling me the two girls filed a complaint stating I was a racist and they were somewhat traumatized. Well, I am a 60 year old Vietnam Infantry Veteran, that almost died from injuries suffered the day before my 19th birthday. My father and uncles all fought for America in the Pacific Islands but I was told I could never earn any money at that school because I was banned from subbing there.Not for telling lies, what I said was true, but because these two 17-18 year old girls were too young to hear the truth! How about that? Only in America!One more incident report and I will be fired from the school district. Arizona is ranked 49th in education in America, can you imagine that?

My grandpa was a soldier in one and he has photo\u2019s that tell that is the truth. and also this story show\u2019s in time of stress and loyalty and hardship there are people who still are good nature and will do anything.

MatthewMarch 20, 2012 9:53 pmTrent (and others),I have just finished taking a College Asian History course. There is arather disturbing fact about Japan\u2019s actions during WW2: they learned it from us! The United States used to routinely shell japanese shores killing thousands of civialians, when the Japanese refused to submit to imperial unjust treaties from the US. This was during the late 1800\u2019s or so. Japan saw the brits and the US, and the French slaughter thousands of civilians in China so that they could have better trade agreements and extraterritoriality. What did they take from this? Be dtrong, crush all other nations in order to survive and be stronger. They applied this to their way of Bushido and this led to severe military fanaticism. Are their actions just? Certainly NOT; but don\u2019t go pointing fingers and think we shoot rays of sunshine out our ass, cus we don\u2019t. You simply don\u2019t read about US atrocities during our imperial reign of the mid 1800\u2019s-the 1900s because we don\u2019t like to talk about it, just as the brits hide their numerous atrocities from their empire (ie-the british instigated opium war). In war no one is clean, even the side that is fighting for the greater good breaks the laws of humanity. I love the USA, and I would gladly serve her, but i\u2019m not delusional to think we\u2019re always so clean.TreyMay 27, 2015 5:26 pmDead on Matt. I totally agree. I love our beautiful nation BUT am not blind to the fact of all the crappy things we (and ALL nations) have done. I understand the lies and cover ups do exist. History is truly written by dominance. But it could be worse and we could be in a much worse position. Many say the civilians in Japan were bad for fighting in their country BUT if we have enemy\u2019s invading our country, killing, and terrorizing everyone you\u2019d better believe our civilians would fight, and be damn good at it too.

Denise RousselMay 4, 2012 8:15 pmOnoda was a hero a hero because he lived true to himself never giving up. So sad he did not know the war was over and so many had to die. I know by his moral standards he has very deep regrets for that.But to have never given up for his country living in such harsh ways for 30 years no one else could do what he did. I would very much like to meet him and shake his hand and be taught by him. The youth that are taught by him will have the best teachings of inner morals and strenth. He even showed how much he feels so much guilt for killing innocent people by donating to the Flillipeans. Onoda was a hero a hero because he lived true to himself never giving up.

PasserbyMay 20, 2012 1:28 amSome of the comments here are really stupid and hilarious.Firstly, we\u2019re talking about an individual japanese soldier, and yes, just him and his acts as an individual. No one forgets what the Japanese Imperial Army had done during the second world war\u2026the horrendous rape of nanking etc.Pls be clear about what you are reading and what you are commenting about. As an individual, Mr Onoda is indeed a patriotic guy for his country. Nothing\u2019s wrong about that. Here in this article, we\u2019re talking and \u201cshowcasing\u201d his loyalty and patriotism to his nation. The article is not about praising the acts of the entire Japanese army during world war 2. So please get the facts about this article right before you comment, complain or even flame, if not it really does make you look like a bull-shitter.The Japanese has already learnt their lesson. Whatever has been done is history. History has thought us, the people of the current generation and also many generation to come, the importance of peace and not waging war. For the Japanese, the lesson has been a very very painful which has haunted them for many decades, which to us, it feels like days, but for them it feels like millions of centuries. The war that they waged and participated in was for the cause of expanding their kingdom and putting in the idea of improving their economy. They have been punished for their wrong-doings and sins with a screwed up economic system now which seems eternal and impossible to recover. Inhumane acts they had done in the world war 2 are purely an act with military authorization, not by the civilians themselves. If you have read up and done your research, the Japanese civillians, like those from the rest of the world, are strongly against such inhumane acts and the acts of war.If you hated Japan and Japanese so much, you should have let them die, perish and extinct during the earthquake and tsunami at Fukushima last year by not donating, not sending condolences, deny them of humanitarian help.History has taught us so much and its time to bury the hatchet and look for progress.Battles bring nothing, but endless battles, u morons.

Yeah sure pacifism is not always the answer and we need war or else the crazy dudes like Hitler, Bush, Bin Laden would take over the world. Four more things 1. Morseman you do fucking realize that Britain and France are our allies dumbass 2.No country is better off running the world every country is horrible in some way. 3.The US president is not the leader of the free world. I\u2019m tired of conservatives calling him that, there are other free countries out there. 4.Trent Civilians are innocent. That\u2019s like saying all the japs were horrible monsters. I know this won\u2019t help because a conservative skull is thick as lead. ConservadoxJuly 26, 2015 9:34 pm@TrollyPonahI thought this might actually be an intelligent comment, until you lumped Bush in with Hitler and Bin Laden. As an American, I find it offensive.

You are the only people to have suffered atrocities during a war.

How about the Nazi source for the original Bush oil fortunes?You are most likely just another loud mouthed New Yorker.

DeniseAugust 7, 2012 2:43 pmI am a Chinese and I really admire the guy because of his guts, I have read all the comments up there and what I have to say is stop being so closed minded, be open minded and think two ways. I\u2019ve come to realize that many Americans are racist and think that they are the best out there, america itself is a very colonial minded country,making other countries at their mercy, i\u2019m just a high school-er but having a broad array of this subject matter, i believe that in war, everyone is ruthless, winning is the only way and the only way to achieve it is being savage. Here in Philippines, people are very ignorant, they believe anything they hear and they worship Americans like they are gods, they believe that anything from the west is good and they blame the government every single minute when it is them who voted for the officials of the said government, most of them don\u2019t even know the BIG debt of every citizen of Phil. to the oh so mighty states that came from bell trade act, i just can\u2019t stop myself from posting this comment >.<TimMay 3, 2013 4:38 pmDenise, what you have to realize is there are are dickheads all over the world.

Been to America several times, you can encounter a good bunch and the ignorant rotten ones as well. On time on a plane, I saw this group of Americans who were acting like everyone else in that flight are \u2018enemies\u2019 and the American couple sitting beside me has this hostile look (though they managed a half-baked, superficial smile when I made the initiative). I was thinking some of them probably are blaming the \u2018brown, yellow, black, pink or violet race\u2019 for the deep shit they are in. I can understand that.However, I could see that lots of Americans are now becoming liberal in their thinking. They are now challenging the long held beliefs and values. They have to otherwise, the whole world is against them. The world needs more people who can speak out and morally challenge things that have been done in the name of \u201cPATRIOTISM\u201d.On another note, China is on the road to greatness. To me, it\u2019s just claiming it\u2019s former glory centuries ago. There is a big BUT\u2026. this time it\u2019s different. CHINA has now the opportunity to show the world that it can lead us in the right way. CHINA needs to understand that hegemony will only ruin its chances in getting the trust of the global community. CHINA and the next generation Chinese have now the opportunity to \u201cGET IT RIGHT\u201d to be the next \u201cUSA\u201d but a better one.

I\u2019ve come to realize that many Americans are racist and think that they are the best out there, america itself is a very colonial minded country,making other countries at their mercy, i\u2019m just a high school-er but having a broad array of this subject matter, i believe that in war, everyone is ruthless, winning is the only way and the only way to achieve it is being savage. Here in Philippines, people are very ignorant, they believe anything they hear and they worship Americans like they are gods, they believe that anything from the west is good and they blame the government every single minute when it is them who voted for the officials of the said government, most of them don\u2019t even know the BIG debt of every citizen of Phil. to the oh so mighty states that came from bell trade act, i just can\u2019t stop myself from posting this comment >.< TimMay 3, 2013 4:38 pmDenise, what you have to realize is there are are dickheads all over the world.

RuffRiderOctober 19, 2014 1:32 amHi Denise, I\u2019m Filipino and I agree with you in most of what you said. Been to America several times, you can encounter a good bunch and the ignorant rotten ones as well. On time on a plane, I saw this group of Americans who were acting like everyone else in that flight are \u2018enemies\u2019 and the American couple sitting beside me has this hostile look (though they managed a half-baked, superficial smile when I made the initiative). I was thinking some of them probably are blaming the \u2018brown, yellow, black, pink or violet race\u2019 for the deep shit they are in. I can understand that.However, I could see that lots of Americans are now becoming liberal in their thinking. They are now challenging the long held beliefs and values. They have to otherwise, the whole world is against them. The world needs more people who can speak out and morally challenge things that have been done in the name of \u201cPATRIOTISM\u201d.On another note, China is on the road to greatness. To me, it\u2019s just claiming it\u2019s former glory centuries ago. There is a big BUT\u2026. this time it\u2019s different. CHINA has now the opportunity to show the world that it can lead us in the right way. CHINA needs to understand that hegemony will only ruin its chances in getting the trust of the global community.

I was stationed on Okinawa, Japan as a U.S. Army JAGC Captain when Hiroo Onoda, San finally came out of the jungle in the Philippines. He was looked upon by my Japanese acquaintances as a hero as well as something of a dinosaur in his beliefs of loyalty and fidelity to his orders from his commander to never surrender or even to die voluntarily. But I never heard anybody, Japanese, Okinawan or American call him a fool.Interestingly, the newspaper articles of that time mentioned that he and his fellow holdouts had come to within sight of Clark Airbase where they saw the Americans loading bombs onto B-52s and other U.S War planes. This was during the Vietnam War; but to them it was further proof that WWII was still raging and Japan had not surrendered.There was another Japanese soldier on Guam who surrendered after Hiroo Onoda, San did, as I recall. This was also in 1974, I think.In fact, an American soldier came\u201dhome\u201d shortly thereafter. He had been part of General Douglas MacArthur\u2019s 1944 retaking of the Philippines. He was wounded and suffered from amnesia. He was cared for by a village mayor and his family near Manila. It took a long time for him to regain his memory. By that time he had married a local lady and had a family. He went on to be an elected representative of the village.In 1974 he came into the U.S. Army liaison office at the U.S. Embassy in Manila. A friend of mine was sent there to act as his attorney in an Army administrative board action to determine what to do with him. He had been in Singapore when the Japanese invaded and overran that British protectorate in 1941. He volunteered to stay behind and destroy oil tanks and other facilities of strategic importance. This was a true suicide mission. He and a few others including British and Australian soldiers escaped. They made their way south into the Malaysian island chain. Along the way he and others saved many lives of civilian and allied troops also escaping through enemy patrolled areas. He eventually ended up in a military hospital in Australia where he was awarded several metals for gallantry and being wounded. He told his appointed JAGC defense counsel of these events. Unfortunately, his Army records had been destroyed in a fire at the facility.Our JAGC office on Okinawa was able to assist him to obtain Australian records and newspaper articles and photos of his story and his metals being awarded. I think there was a newspaper photo of Gen MacArthur at his bedside pinning a metal on him. At any rate when the General asked for volunteers to retake the Philippines he raised his hand despite his wounds. The Army review board decided to give him an honorable discharge or a general discharge under honorable conditions thus preserving his VA Benefits as a wartime veteran.Several of his metals had been Money metals. He also was due earned pay at least until he was missing.As I recall he came from Oklahoma where I think he still had a surviving sister at that time. The last I heard about him was that he and his wife and maybe even his children visited her. I am sorry I do not remember his name. . Thanks for the story. I was stationed on Okinawa, Japan as a U.S. Army JAGC Captain when Hiroo Onoda, San finally came out of the jungle in the Philippines. He was looked upon by my Japanese acquaintances as a hero as well as something of a dinosaur in his beliefs of loyalty and fidelity to his orders from his commander to never surrender or even to die voluntarily. But I never heard anybody, Japanese, Okinawan or American call him a fool.Interestingly, the newspaper articles of that time mentioned that he and his fellow holdouts had come to within sight of Clark Airbase where they saw the Americans loading bombs onto B-52s and other U.S War planes. This was during the Vietnam War; but to them it was further proof that WWII was still raging and Japan had not surrendered.There was another Japanese soldier on Guam who surrendered after Hiroo Onoda, San did, as I recall. This was also in 1974, I think.In fact, an American soldier came\u201dhome\u201d shortly thereafter. He had been part of General Douglas MacArthur\u2019s 1944 retaking of the Philippines. He was wounded and suffered from amnesia. He was cared for by a village mayor and his family near Manila. It took a long time for him to regain his memory. By that time he had married a local lady and had a family. He went on to be an elected representative of the village.In 1974 he came into the U.S. Army liaison office at the U.S. Embassy in Manila. A friend of mine was sent there to act as his attorney in an Army administrative board action to determine what to do with him. He had been in Singapore when the Japanese invaded and overran that British protectorate in 1941. He volunteered to stay behind and destroy oil tanks and other facilities of strategic importance. This was a true suicide mission. He and a few others including British and Australian soldiers escaped. They made their way south into the Malaysian island chain. Along the way he and others saved many lives of civilian and allied troops also escaping through enemy patrolled areas. He eventually ended up in a military hospital in Australia where he was awarded several metals for gallantry and being wounded. He told his appointed JAGC defense counsel of these events. Unfortunately, his Army records had been destroyed in a fire at the facility.Our JAGC office on Okinawa was able to assist him to obtain Australian records and newspaper articles and photos of his story and his metals being awarded. I think there was a newspaper photo of Gen MacArthur at his bedside pinning a metal on him. At any rate when the General asked for volunteers to retake the Philippines he raised his hand despite his wounds. The Army review board decided to give him an honorable discharge or a general discharge under honorable conditions thus preserving his VA Benefits as a wartime veteran.Several of his metals had been Money metals. He also was due earned pay at least until he was missing.As I recall he came from Oklahoma where I think he still had a surviving sister at that time.

Rocky GauseNovember 5, 2012 5:07 pmA Veterans Day treasure, the true, first-person account of a captured World War II soldiers incredible escape and courageous journey home, discovered after more than fifty years. Of all the heroic stories to come out of World War II, few are so extraordinary as that of Major Rocky Gause, who was captured by the Japanese, escaped from the infamous Bataan Death March, and, with a fellow soldier, endured a harrowing voyage across the enemy-held Pacific in a leaky, hand-crafted boat. In the battered notebook he kept throughout his journey and later converted to a thrilling narrative, Gause traced his steps from the besieged city of Manila on New Years Eve, 1941, to his safe landing on the Australian coast ten months later.

Onoda deluded himself into thinking that he was in danger for most of those years, despite much evidence to the contrary, and the danger of getting killed became real due to his willful, destructive courses of action. He had the same paranoid mindset as apocalyptic-type preppers, hypocritical anti-authority fanatics, and mass shooting perpetrators.Comments praising him as a dedicated, heroic, loyal, moral, courageous, patriotic survivalist are misguided at best considering he was a well-armed soldier hiding in a sparsely populated mountain jungle surrounded mainly by poor, civilian peasants, many of whom he murdered, injured, or stole from.

They are the source of great evils in this world. They are all flawed human beings but because of their wealth and influence, those flaws are magnified at global scale. To me, for humanity to advance, we each should learn to have a sense of self-importance and be able to question any leader, and not just blindly follow them. I think this is the root cause of the problem. American Patriotism? I think that at one point in history, this was all-important. However, as the world has changed, it no longer serves it purpose. In fact, this is causing so much suffering in the world now and is being exploited by those people who are \u201ctoo smart\u201d and profiting from it. Every soldier should now learn to ask the morality of what he is being asked to do. And for future generations, we should teach our children to do the same. Regardless of what their jobs will be when they grow up. SimonMay 31, 2013 2:05 pmHow should one view this amazing story? Is he a hero? If an American, Brit or other westerner had endured the same predicament, with history reversed, and survived, armed and active in the jungle until 1974, the press would have had a field day. After the initial reconciliation with family, presented in emotional gushes that the press just can\u2019t resist, there would have then been interest stories documenting one of his typical days and opinion pieces discussing his dilemna. His \u2018crimes\u2019 against villages would have been, quite rightly, minimised in these articles. Overall, there would have been incredible respect, as is due anyone who has lived in the jungle for 30 years, albeit under false assumptions. The word hero may have been used, but that word, worn out by so many Hollywood war movies, would have been avoided by most good journalists. A good writer would have concentrated on the following: First, his initial devotion to duty \u2013 a quality which was not lacking in the second world war on either side of the conflict, with the objectives for either side abundantly clear, but absolutely admirable and praiseworthy under the circumstances. Secondly, the dilemna \u2013 that all they saw was a ruse \u2013 civilian clothes, leaflets, even Japanese newspapers \u2013 all \u2018tricks\u2019 by the enemy. Parallels exist with anyone who has ever tried to get a family member out of a cult \u2013 whatever one does or says is interpreted suspiciously. Thirdly, within his isolated company of only four, then three, two and finally one, and with the accretion of years and actions performed, his false view that the war was continuing must only have been solidified over time, not undermined.With great respect to Hiroo Onoda, it is the mix of the above three that tragically led to the \u2018crushing blow\u2019 \u2013 missing the love of his family for thirty years.

He was friends with some of the people Onoda killed.It is disgusting that Onoda is praised as a hero and his victims\u2019 names are not even mentioned. Far more disgusting is how another visitor from China (Denise in the first comment) even insults us for thinking of Onoda as a murderer.Just flip over the situation and imagine if a Filipino did the same thing in China or Japan or the US.

RayCSeptember 12, 2013 10:59 amI recall when this happened, I was working at a Defense Contractor. As we discussed the story of Onoda\u2019s eventual surrender, a friend of mine humorously observed that perhaps Onoda could not believe Japan had lost the war because they came for him in Toyota trucks, took his picture and recorded his voice with Panasonic and Sony equipment, and planned to fly him home in a Mitsubishi airliner \ud83d\ude42 I recall when this happened, I was working at a Defense Contractor.

BEGNovember 6, 2013 6:54 amThe man deserves consideration for his dedication and his survival skills. He was raised with traditional Japanese virtues and his efforts to follow orders to harass the enemy and gather intelligence was what drove him to survive. I cannot imagine why it took so long, or such special effort to convince him the war was finished, but it did and I don\u2019t find fault with Onoda-san. He has tried to be a good citizen since his surrender and I can find little fault with his actions, if in fact he truly thought the war continued.That all said\u2026America, specifically Theodore Roosevelt, by playing secret international politics, set the whole war in the Pacific in action long before Pearl Harbor. It was American meddling and greed that instigated the invasion of Korea and China by the Japanese, and why the Japanese felt compelled to launch into WWII.

Okay, to people of the Phillipines: You\u2019re right. WW2 was terrible to your people and a whole lot of other people. I wish we could fix this. We can\u2019t. My message: Sad as it is this guy was cool and loyal, but yeah, he was messed up. He was a patriot, but he also killed 30 civilians, so let\u2019s put him there with paranoid soldier with an incredible story who deserves respect, but not admiration. To people like Trent: Like I said! Japan sucked, but um\u2026 So did the Allies. But we got the advantage , so we got to say we were heroes with unquestionable morals and the ability to save the world, which we helped, but we did do our fair share of screwing people over.To Liberals: Yeah, the U.S. also sucks, but not that much. We screwed up but we\u2019re doing our best. This government stuff is hard, which is where we screw up. Just like other countries. And to everyone: This man isn\u2019t even in the same park as Hitler. He\u2019s also not some godly version of Japanese morals. He messed up, but he was only doing it cause he was told to. There\u2019s plenty of blame to go around. Let\u2019s share the blame shall we? And the pride, maybe. At least a bit of it, Just calm down with the politics.

Just as I\u2019m sure you would be offended if I referred to all liberals as being lazy, brainwashed and only relying on emotions for their belief systems.Case is point I am horrified my country has the distinction of being the ONLY country in history to have used atomic weapons on civilians. I also condem the brutal firebombing of civilian targets in Europe and Japan. It\u2019s bloody murder.I disagree the atomic bombing saved millions of lives. That statement is conjecture as the Invasion Olympic never occurred. Take in consideration the following alternative realities that might have occurred instead of Hiroshima and Nagasaki:1. We dropped a nuke as a demonstration on Mt Fuji or a relatively isolated military target. The Japanese still surrender with harsh terms and the war ends the same minus 300,000 dead women, babies and old men.2. We offer a negotiated peace with unfavorable but acceptable terms ( such as respecting the emperor and some concessions to a limited defense force of the home Islands). The war also ends similarly to # 1 and with much less expense to the US taxpayer.3. We ( gasp) offer mutually beneficial terms to the Japanese who readily accept. They give up remaining offensive Naval forces and territorial gains in the pacific to the Allies, pay damages, surrender over war criminals and agree to an organized but gradual withdrawal from mainland Asia. In return they are allowed to keep control of their Economy, army, Air Force and limited coast guard. Also in return they become our armed allies.Consider the immense historical favorable impact that #3 would have had:A. Mao Tse Tung is defeated. Caught between the US supplied Chaing Kai Shek armies and The Japanese Army of the Kwangtung Mao Tse Tung is defeated and China becomes a billion strong ALLY of the US. 50 million freedom loving Chinese are not murdered by the commies.B. The Korean War and Vietnamese never occur. A couple of hundred thousand American boys never die or are wounded.C. Russia having to watch their \u201cback door\u201d never becomes agressive in Central Europe. Cuba remains free. The Cold War never happens.D. The Soviet Union implodes earlier, more millions of freedom loving people prosperE. The US is not as universally hated as we seem to be now.Unlikely\u2026perhaps. What is just as unlikely is the statement that the atomic bombing saved lives and made the world a better place.Jonny GannettSeptember 6, 2016 1:10 pmIt made it better for Japan. One might argue that not using it might have stopped China and Russia from knowing it even existed though. Would you want the US to be the only one with Nukes? Idk.

Just as I\u2019m sure you would be offended if I referred to all liberals as being lazy, brainwashed and only relying on emotions for their belief systems. Case is point I am horrified my country has the distinction of being the ONLY country in history to have used atomic weapons on civilians. I also condem the brutal firebombing of civilian targets in Europe and Japan. It\u2019s bloody murder. I disagree the atomic bombing saved millions of lives. That statement is conjecture as the Invasion Olympic never occurred. Take in consideration the following alternative realities that might have occurred instead of Hiroshima and Nagasaki: 1. We dropped a nuke as a demonstration on Mt Fuji or a relatively isolated military target. The Japanese still surrender with harsh terms and the war ends the same minus 300,000 dead women, babies and old men.2. We offer a negotiated peace with unfavorable but acceptable terms ( such as respecting the emperor and some concessions to a limited defense force of the home Islands). The war also ends similarly to # 1 and with much less expense to the US taxpayer.3. We ( gasp) offer mutually beneficial terms to the Japanese who readily accept. They give up remaining offensive Naval forces and territorial gains in the pacific to the Allies, pay damages, surrender over war criminals and agree to an organized but gradual withdrawal from mainland Asia. In return they are allowed to keep control of their Economy, army, Air Force and limited coast guard. Also in return they become our armed allies. Consider the immense historical favorable impact that #3 would have had:A. Mao Tse Tung is defeated. Caught between the US supplied Chaing Kai Shek armies and The Japanese Army of the Kwangtung Mao Tse Tung is defeated and China becomes a billion strong ALLY of the US. 50 million freedom loving Chinese are not murdered by the commies.B. The Korean War and Vietnamese never occur. A couple of hundred thousand American boys never die or are wounded.C. Russia having to watch their \u201cback door\u201d never becomes agressive in Central Europe. Cuba remains free. The Cold War never happens.D. The Soviet Union implodes earlier, more millions of freedom loving people prosperE. The US is not as universally hated as we seem to be now. Unlikely\u2026perhaps. What is just as unlikely is the statement that the atomic bombing saved lives and made the world a better place. Jonny GannettSeptember 6, 2016 1:10 pmIt made it better for Japan. One might argue that not using it might have stopped China and Russia from knowing it even existed though. Would you want the US to be the only one with Nukes? Idk.

There are too many ridiculous comments for me to respond to. Most of the comments here are posted either by trolls/liars or extremely biased people with no conception of history. True the things Onoda did were bad but no-one here is praising him for that, people are respecting him because after 29 years he kept doing what he thought he had too, which is probably 29 years longer than most of you could even handle. Also his reasoning that the pamphlets were fake was in its own way smart. Would you surrender a war because a pamphlet told you too? Those who say we could have prevented the atomic bombs by having the allies surrender is ridiculous, the loss of life would have been much higher had we surrendered to Hitler not even including the fact the Jewish population and religion would have been wiped out along with anyone else Hitler had a whim to kill. I am not saying the allies were innocent, I\u2019m just saying they were much better than the alternative.JonDecember 14, 2014 4:28 pmSpot on. Honestly what is there to say?

ZephFebruary 15, 2014 9:43 amIt\u2019s interesting how people evaluate the effect of dropping the atomic bombs. Those who are very sure that Japan would have surrendered anyway should read the details of the internal struggle over whether to surrender even AFTER the bombs \u2013 if it was such a close call which faction would win out even with two bombs and the threat of more and with Russia entering the war, how can you think it would have been a slam-dunk without the bombs, or with only a demo? And of course one big issue was that the Allies were demanding \u201cunconditional surrender\u201d which would allow them to unseat the militarist government to avoid repeated wars \u2013 just as they had done in Europe. Japan would have more easily accepted a truce with US & the UK which allowed them to continue the war in China etc and continue the Co-prosperity sphere with some limitations, and kept the military in totalitarian control of their society. Would that have led to a better and more peaceful next half century, than the unconditional surrender?unclealfieSeptember 30, 2016 12:48 pmWe whipped their asses fair and square.

Jonathan WongMarch 1, 2014 7:06 pmIf not the military force, it was the will of the Japanese soldiers of that time that was truly a forced to be reckoned with. They had such immense loyalty and dedication and some of these elements can be apparent in modern day Japan with the stereotypical Japanese salaryman being an immense workaholic with no time for family.Even if this man can be considered a fool for refusing to believe that his country had lost the war for 29 years, his lengthly service was proof of his pride in his own country (refusing to believe it could loose even after such a time), loyalty and honor and for that I respect him a great deal.

Most likely they are all part of a \u201cbig boys\u201d club and they just settle a war in a table with papers while those under their command are spilling blood needlessly.I would hope to live and see the day that all soldiers would morally question each and every mission he is going to.McHaggisAugust 20, 2016 5:53 pmI don\u2019t think you will see that day.

When RiffRider writes \u201cThe poor, the ordinary people, the masses\u2026 we are always the cannon fodder during wars\u201d he(I am assuming it is a he bc the name he has denotes male gender) is just associating with or describing himself as one or all the 3 adjectives he uses to describe the kind of people who are used as \u201c\u2026cannon fodder during wars.\u201d Generally, though there are exceptions, he is correct about that concept. He is not saying anything about being a veteran or about being personally involved in any war in whatever fashion. Nor does he need to when he states \u201cwe\u201d. He is simply using the word \u201cwe\u201d to associate himself as belonging to that specific class of people that are seen as unimportant and expendable. Understand??? Stop being so narcissistic about being a veteran and stop questioning someone else\u2019s comments should they not be a veteran, then I\u2019ll stop hounding you on your idiotic comments. However, I would also like to say \u201cThank you for serving in the military for the protection and benefit of all U.S. citizens!\u201d The poor, the ordinary people, the masses\u2026 we are always the cannon fodder during wars. As for the aristocrats, the elite, the politicians, rarely do they suffer the consequences, a few exceptions maybe. Most likely they are all part of a \u201cbig boys\u201d club and they just settle a war in a table with papers while those under their command are spilling blood needlessly. I would hope to live and see the day that all soldiers would morally question each and every mission he is going to. McHaggisAugust 20, 2016 5:53 pmI don\u2019t think you will see that day.

The people on islands occupied by the Japanese were so brainwashed that women jumped of cliffs with their babies in their arms because the were so afraid of the allies armies, the Japanese people were ready to all die, including little kids, If you think they would have welcomed a surrender you are in a dreamworld. The A bombs was the safest way to deal with a country that attacked us first.Blue BeamSeptember 16, 2016 8:48 pmWell the goes for the atom bomb as well.

You would be a fool to think that any country is full of one type of person.As for the A-Bomb, a number of people have argued that it was, to some extent, less effective than when we fire-bombed their cities. This is because most of their structures at the time were made of wood. So dropping fire-bombs would wipe out cities and countryside and do so slowly enough to draw in more people to fight the fires, only to have them overwhelmed by the fire.Regardless of that, there were many signs pointing to them already discussing surrendering prior to the first A-Bomb being dropped.And honestly, to suggest that the best way to deal with a people is to commit mass murder that is completely indiscriminate of who the victims are (soldiers, civilians, CHILDREN) is completely inhuman and disgusting.

OMGNovember 18, 2014 10:20 pmAlthough I think the determination of the Japanese people and their honor is respectable, can\u2019t we just say nothing is justified in the war?

The text book from elementary schools contain war stories that teach them the tragetic stories during the war. When I was in elementary school in the U.S., I only remember reading how the U.S. grew together with the victory in the war.BTW someone above talked about the shrines in Japan that worship the dead soldiers who fought in war, but all my Japanese friends tell me that the shrine\u2019s purpose is for just praying the deads who worked hard to make the country Japan, but NOT thanking about the war.dunclealfieSeptember 30, 2016 12:39 pm\u201cpraying the deads\u201d?christinanolanXDNovember 29, 2016 5:02 amYeah, sort of like how Westeners visit funerals and Christians hold prayers for the dead, especially in funeral.

RoyJune 25, 2015 5:27 pmI just wonder, how many of these negative comments about the USA are made by people living under the freedoms provided by the victory over Japan and Germany. If I remember right the USA was staying out of the war until Japan attacked us. The U.S. is always blamed for so many horrific things and is always being told to stay out of other countries affairs well it should also be known that the U.S. gives so much to other countries not just monetary means of support but also protection, guidance, and on and on and on. The U.S. is a great nation yes we do have our problems we have made many mistakes but please please I beg everyone who has a negative comment about the U.S. to show me a country which is perfect and hasn\u2019t ever done any wrong. The dropping off the atomic bombs worked they did what they were supposed to do, they ended the war against Japan who by the way made the first blow after lying to us in the peace talks, but whatever, chances are every negative comment on here are made by people who live in a country that has been helped by the U.S. BUT AS THE OLD SAYING GOES IGNORANCE IS BLISS I just wonder, how many of these negative comments about the USA are made by people living under the freedoms provided by the victory over Japan and Germany.

They butchered, tortured, and raped thousands of innocent civilians, men, women and children. You can hold this POS up as a hero if that\u2019s what you think, but try reading a bit of the history of Japan to gain some knowledge of the race.Today they have come to accept and be accepted by the rest of the world. This is good. But their past can not be covered up with flowery sentimental phrases of praise for their bravery. They were what they were and nobody can change that.cheetoAugust 29, 2016 11:21 pmEvery race has committed atrocities, singling out the Japanese is dumb because it isn\u2019t like they\u2019re the only ones to do anything bad, I mean, take a look at what Americans have done, or Syrians, or the British to name a few. No race is pure and innocent, humans have always been corrupt.Jonny GannettSeptember 6, 2016 12:54 pmThat\u2019s nonsense. They weren\u2019t saints, but every army in WW II butchered, tortured, and raped thousands of people. Japanese war crimes should be condemned, but let us not forget that they aren\u2019t the only ones who committed crimes against humanity, and they weren\u2019t the last to do it. At least dropping the A bombs fundamentally changed Japan for the better. They likely would never have surrendered if all of them were this dedicated. It\u2019s sad that it would come to such a terrible choice though. But I suppose in the long run it has changed the country for the better, mostly due to American occupation and changing their country to be more democratic and basically saying they will forever give up the right to be aggressive and that they can only defend themselves not attack others. If only other countries were like that, the world would likely be a lot less war torn. Not to say it would be peaceful persay as it\u2019d just be violence in each country instead of against different countries. Also, America did some pretty fucked up shit during Vietnam. Looking at the horrible way it\u2019s affected the veterans. So many of them came back with PTSD and barely could function. The problem with being a soldier like that is that you get to a point where you can\u2019t stop going back to war because home doesn\u2019t feel like home anymore. At least that\u2019s what I\u2019ve heard and seen from veterans and movies and tv. America treats its veterans like shit too despite them doing so much in the name of their country. I mean it\u2019s fucking wrong that they would make you do such terrible things and not even try and help you deal with it. War is hell. Seems like too me there\u2019s two types of soldiers. Psychopaths who enjoy killing and get a thrill out of it, and the people who can\u2019t handle it and become wrecked by the atrocities and horrors they saw and had to do. The Japanese were horrible murderers during W.W. II. They butchered, tortured, and raped thousands of innocent civilians, men, women and children.

Onoda was last man standing, and after 30 years he didn\u2019t know anything else. chuckobscure .February 24, 2017 9:30 amMaybe work on your grammar before calling someone an idiot?

It actually just makes me terribly, terribly distressed and extremely sad. It\u2019s amazing what propaganda and programming can do. He basically fell into a mental state of paranoia.

Lalanya LoveFebruary 9, 2017 9:53 amOkay, I think you are stretching this story a little bit too far when you start to paint the picture of this guy or people like him as a dedicated hero. If he were really that intelligent as a true hero should be, he would have figured out the war was over when it happened. There\u2019s no excuse on that. Besides, everything you mentioned was all completely imaginary. There was no o ne after him or trying to kill him, so there was nothing to fight. Everything he continued to do was out of destructive stupidity & by no means was it heroic in any way. Now, the things he may have done after the fact, like donating $ to his victims- now that might be considered a little more heroic in my book, but not by far does it make up for his mistakes. A Hero doesn\u2019t live in imagination \u2013 one lives in reality & truth of humanity \u2013 not a fantasy world made up in their head of a fake battle that they were/were NOT fighting. This is illusion / Disillusion. Okay, I think you are stretching this story a little bit too far when you start to paint the picture of this guy or people like him as a dedicated hero.

It\u2019s amazing how much traction this story is still getting after all this time. It goes to show how frail we are as a species, and how easily we stand up to point out who is right and who is wrong in (war) events that make losers out of all of us. I\u2019d love to see Clint Eastwood turn this into a human character story on the big screen. It would be a great opportunity to teach many about how unnecessary and irrelevant our petty differences are, certainly not important enough to kill anyone over. Wow!

Mark RyderDecember 7, 2018 6:16 amHonestly, this story just shows the danger of intractable integrity and the evil of nationalist propaganda. Being absolutely true to what you believe can be horrible if you are not open to believing something new. This man killed many innocent civilians (literally a mass murderer/ serial killer) and wasted his own life simply because he was so thoroughly brainwashed by his country that he could not accept the evidence of his own eyes and his own experience. He had to wait thirty years to be personally told a new truth by one of his original indoctrinators (good thing the man had not been killed in the war or died of old age first). He literally gave his mind up to another person/governement.THIS IS NOT A GOOD OR COMMENDABLE THING! It is just sad.
