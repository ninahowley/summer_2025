The American Geophysical Union (AGU), the world\u2019s largest association of Earth and space scientists, and the American Meteorological Society (AMS) called on researchers to submit peer-reviewed studies to inform the upcoming National Climate Assessment (NCA). Required by Congress and published every few years since 2000, the NCA is the most comprehensive source of information about how climate change affects the US. State and local governments, as well as private companies, have been using the report to prepare for the impacts of climate change-related calamities, such as heatwaves, floods, and droughts. But hundreds of volunteer contributors who had been working for almost a year on the sixth edition of the assessment, scheduled for early 2028, were dismissed in late April. An email informed them that the report\u2019s scope was being \u201cre-evaluated\u201d and thanked them for their work. \u201cAs plans develop for the assessment, there may be future opportunities to contribute or engage. Thank you for your service,\u201d the email read. In astatementreleased on Friday, AMS and AGU said it was their duty to \u201cmaintain momentum\u201d of research supporting the assessment and to ensure Americans are \u201cprotected and prepared\u201d for the impacts of a rapidly changing climate. \u201cThe National Climate Assessment is a comprehensive, rigorous integration and evaluation of the latest climate science knowledge that decision makers \u2014 from government at all levels to private enterprise \u2014 need in order to understand the world in which we live,\u201d said AMS President David J. Stensrud. Featured image: Lieut. Commander Mark Moran, NOAA Corps, NMAO/AOC via Flickr.
