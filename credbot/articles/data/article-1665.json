Seemingly every week we\u2019re bombarded with a new directive as to what a healthy diet should or should not include. A new book finally puts the kibosh on faulty information we have long been told about the advantages of a low-fat diet. In fact, it turns out, our bodiesneedcertain fats to maintain optimal health. By Christopher J. Petherick There\u2019s a war going on inside this country. However, this one doesn\u2019t involve militarized police kicking down doors and shooting innocent people or even the propaganda war that\u2019s being waged to control your thoughts. This fight is over your health\u2014more specifically, what you\u2019re being told is good to eat in order to ensure optimal health. It\u2019s evident that regular Americans are losing this battle, because for too long they have followed the advice of the medical and dietary experts who have argued that eating fat-free foods is the only path to good health. Thankfully, though, new research is validating what many health advocates have been saying for years: Your body needs fat to function, and if you want to lose weight and live a long and healthy life, then eat more fat. Sally Fallon Morell, the founder and president of theWeston A. Price Foundationand owner ofPA Bowen farmsteadin Brandywine, Md., has long said that human beings need to eat healthy fats to achieve peak health. Her new book, titledNourishing Fats: Why We Need Animal Fats for Health and Happiness*, makes just this case, arguing cogently that fat-free margarines and certain vegetable oils are not just making people fat and unhealthy, they\u2019re actually killing us. Mrs Morrell also maintainsher own \u201cNourishing Traditions\u201d blogon health and nutrition. The premise of the book is laid out right on the cover of the book: \u201cAnimal fats are not villains.\u201d Over the years, Americans have been inundated with bad advice on how to eat healthy that\u2019s not just inconsistent, but schizophrenic. One day, it\u2019s \u201cDon\u2019t eat any fats\u2014they\u2019re all bad for you.\u201d The next day it\u2019s, \u201cOkay, you can eat some fats from fish and avocadoes.\u201d Then, the next day, they tell us, \u201cWell, eggs and meat aren\u2019t that bad for you after all.\u201d Listen to AFP\u2019s interview with Sally Fallon Morrell by clicking the link below. Now, an editorial published inThe British Journal of Sports Medicineby several leading cardiologists states: \u201cIt is time to shift the public health message in the prevention and treatment of coronary artery disease away from measuring serum lipids [cholesterol] and reducing dietary saturated fat. Coronary artery disease is a chronic inflammatory disease, and it can be reduced effectively by walking 22 minutes a day and eating real food.\u201d The real food they\u2019re referring to consists of full-fat milk and other once-maligned foods that your parents and grandparents ate. It\u2019s no wonder the average person is totally confused by this. It\u2019s also no wonder obesity rates are through the roof. Mrs. Morell\u2019s farm is only a few miles up the road from this editor\u2019s house. She sat down with me recently to discuss her book as well as her tireless work to educate Americans on healthy living. Her views are devastating to the medical and dietary establishment, arguing that animal fats are not just not bad for you\u2014they actually are vital for the human body to function. \u201cAnimal fats are essential for us,\u201d Mrs. Morell told AFP. \u201cOne thing that the mainstream media and the establishment has never budged on is that saturated fats are the enemy. They\u2019re bad. They\u2019ll clog your arteries. And this is where we\u2019ve gone wrong. Saturated fats are critical for our health, and, of course, we get saturated fats mostly from animal fats.\u201d Mrs. Morell told AFP, \u201cWhat\u2019s in the animal fats are nutrients we can\u2019t get anywhere else\u2014vitamins A, D, and K\u2014that are absolutely critical for our health.\u201d Her book contains nearly 30 pages of footnotes that cite scientific research studies and books proving that animal fats are healthy for the human body. AFP is carrying Mrs. Morell\u2019s book,Nourishing Fats, which also includes 35 pages of healthy recipes. To put it simply, if you want to be healthy and live a long, happy life, give up the fad diets and the refined and processed foods and go back to eating real food. You\u2019ll lose weight and feel better, and you\u2019ll get to eat amazingly well, too. Christopher J. Petherick is the editor-in-chief ofAmerican Free Pressand has a small farm in historic Southern Maryland. *Nourishing Fats: Why We Need Animal Fats for Health and Happiness(softcover, 272 pages) is available from AFP\u2019s Bookstore for $25.
