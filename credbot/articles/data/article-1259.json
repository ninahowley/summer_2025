Not wanting their hot streak to end, it didn't take long for Toronto to bounce back. The Blue Jays scored twice in the third, then two more times in the fourth. After Toronto added another run in the fifth on an Ernie Clement solo shot, neither team scored for the rest of the contest. With a sweep-clinching 5-2 victory in their back pocket, the Blue Jays improved to 12-2 over their last 14 games. According toTSN's StatsCentre, that is tied for Toronto's second-best 14-game stretch since 1994. They went 13-1 between July 30 and Aug. 13 in 2015, but have otherwise maxed out at 12-2 seven separate times in the last 31 seasons.
