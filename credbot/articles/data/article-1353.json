Even if it is only a drop punt away from the \u201cs--- Coles\u201d. May 26, 2025 byTony Wilson **In my suburb, it\u2019s easy to tell the locals apart \u2013 just look at their legs** A flat gradient is a rare occurrence in my suburb, where the locals stand out for one physical feature \u2013 the result of trekking up and down endless hills. May 19, 2025 byLarissa Dubecki **My suburb is an undiscovered slice of fresh air, and locals like it that way** The residents of my suburb tell me they grew up here, as did their parents, and they hope their children will stay here as well. And why wouldn\u2019t they want to? May 12, 2025 byAramiha Harwood **My suburb has a reputation for being soulless and unliveable. But people flock here anyway** I moved back to Melbourne from Hong Kong with a mantra: I can\u2019t do typical suburbia. Luckily, someone had built a solution. May 5, 2025 byJoanne Anderson **My suburb is one of Melbourne\u2019s most liveable, though nobody seems to know it exists** Many feared the skyrail would tear my suburb apart, but the unified town centre has given it a heart, and a whole new personality. April 28, 2025 byMatt McDonald **My suburb\u2019s gated enclave is known as the Toorak of the west. It wants to secede** Officially, I was a resident of a plain-jane suburb, but my letters and parcels marked me a proud inhabitant of a refined community. April 21, 2025 byDavid Goodwin **My suburb is one of Melbourne\u2019s tiniest. I want to make it bigger** The heart of my suburb was ailing when we moved here \u2013 until something changed. Now my neighbours want to gatekeep it from new residents. April 14, 2025 byTom Hird **My suburb on the city fringe has a claim to fame, but it\u2019s no one-trick pony** A Shake\u2019n\u2019Dog at Wendy\u2019s and a movie from Blockbuster - my childhood at the end of the line was charmed. My suburb has since transformed, but my family name can rekindle the past. April 7, 2025 byMadison Griffiths **My suburb was meant to be the Toorak of the north but our reputation took a nefarious turn** A ranking of Melbourne\u2019s suburbs once listed mine at 184th place. Its name used to make taxi drivers fearful, but life here has changed. March 31, 2025 byMichael Church **In my suburb we\u2019re not snobs. But we look down on Black Rock and Brighton** My suburb is home to the real Fountain Lakes shopping centre, which extends ostentatiously over the top of eight lanes of the Nepean Highway. March 24, 2025 byColin Hill **My seaside suburb once had a whimsical name. Then it was given a posh rebrand** Named with a regal nod, my suburb is known for its well-heeled residents and summer vibes. But there\u2019s more to us than our royal connection.

February 24, 2025 bySara McMillan **My suburb has panoramic views: \u2018You can see the whole world!\u2019** What other Melbourne suburb would feature a Tram Road, even though there are no actual trams anywhere to be seen?

February 10, 2025 bySamantha Keir **My suburb is known as the Elwood of the west, but it\u2019s actually better (apart from the stench)** On warm summer evenings, when the streets are full of punters, you can understand why it was named one of the coolest neighbourhoods in the world. February 3, 2025 byJohn Weldon **My suburb has the best of all worlds. For years, there was a whiff of discontent** Even as the city has grown around it, my suburb has retained a country feel with market gardens and old farm buildings on the village fringe. January 27, 2025 byWarren Duncan **Snakes in the basement and summer dance parties: My suburb is a cut above plain old Coburg** There\u2019s one thing that makes Coburg North superior to plain old Coburg, and it isn\u2019t the all-day summer dance parties.

December 16, 2024 byClancy Briggs **Hands off, Camberwell: Melbourne\u2019s most charming cinema is ours, not yours** My suburb\u2019s stereotype is Lululemon, accountants and lawyers, with a lot of \u201cWhere are your kids at school?\u201d There\u2019s also the case of an inter-suburban theft. December 9, 2024 bySarah Moller **The parks in my valley suburb are great \u2013 but there\u2019s a grim reason why** Cyclists and walkers can easily find relief from the inner city in my suburb\u2019s walking tracks, which overlook the neighbourhood\u2019s biggest misfortune. December 2, 2024 byChris Poropat **My tiny offshoot suburb is just like Coburg \u2013 but boring** I tell myself that we made a very canny investment when we moved here. But the only reason was because we\u2019d been priced out everywhere else. November 25, 2024 byDavid Clements **My suburb likes to hide its identity. Even our most famous building is misplaced** After coming up in the world, my suburb would love to build a moat around ourselves. Instead, we keep people out with a welcomed level crossing and plethora of speed bumps. November 18, 2024 byCara Waters **My suburb has a bad reputation, but buzzes with the energy of those making a second start** If you watched the recent Q&A filmed in my suburb, you\u2019d think our area was little more than crime gangs, cultural ghettos and \u201cwhite flight\u201d. November 11, 2024 byRhonda Garad **My shabby suburb was once at the cutting edge. Now, it is filled with hard rubbish** I call my suburb retro chic, but others say it is shabby and tired.

October 14, 2024 byShemsiya Waritu **My suburb might be boring, but walking the streets is an extreme sport** Our streets have seen countless broken wrists and scraped knees, with many locals familiar with the thrill of fanging downhill on what are arguably suburban Melbourne\u2019s steepest streets. October 7, 2024 byJoe Comer **My suburb fought so hard to stay off the radar that Melburnians can\u2019t even get its name right** It\u2019s nice to live in a suburb that is just somewhere people are happy to live. We\u2019ve got one cafe, one convenience store and two churches \u2013 and the only residential tower is a retirement village.

September 9, 2024 byMarisa Mowszowski **Grandma said my suburb was for \u2018poor people\u2019. Now it\u2019s one of Melbourne\u2019s most expensive** When we moved here, Grandma couldn\u2019t understand why my parents wouldn\u2019t buy somewhere nice, like Glen Waverley. September 2, 2024 byIsabel Robinson **I moved from the trendy inner north to a boring suburb \u2013 and it was worth the trade-offs** Now, when I visit suburbs with cachet, I leave feeling that being burdened with that much cultural capital looks exhausting.

August 19, 2024 byKylie Northover **There\u2019s much more to my suburb than gangsters and footballer\u2019s wives** My neighbourhood is considered one of the posher western suburbs \u2013 but an element of the underworld makes it an interesting proposition. August 12, 2024 byKerrie O'Brien **A fight over a mural has put a frog in my suburb\u2019s throat** My suburb has witnessed school closures and division over elevating the train station.

It may also be Melbourne\u2019s whitest** When Peter Dutton takes aim at \u201cwoke inner-city elites\u201d, he means people in my suburb, where all children (or wokelings) are fluent in Welcome To Country. July 15, 2024 byTom Ormonde **My village may be tiny but you can still get a latte every 165 metres** Our little community sits at the point where concrete suburbia meets bushland. And like all good frontier communities, we make our own rules. July 8, 2024 byRosie Beaumont **My suburb once had 98 pubs. These days, you\u2019re more likely to bump into a \u2018nana trolley\u2019** With a \u201cpub on every corner\u201d during the gold rush, my neighbourhood is now a source of amusement for suburban workmates.

June 24, 2024 byJon McMillan **My big hug of a suburb never wants for anything. Who cares if it\u2019s boring and bland?** My suburb\u2019s secret sauce is its solidity. What the younger me saw as boring and bland, I now recognise as reassuring, comfortable and privileged. June 17, 2024 byJacquie Byron **My unpretentious suburb is such a vast nothingness, it doesn\u2019t even have a stereotype** Maybe Clayton South\u2019s bubble of irrelevancy is its appeal.

But back then, locals loved the cheap rent and \u201canything goes\u201d attitude.
