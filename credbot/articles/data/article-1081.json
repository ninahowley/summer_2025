What to Know About the Research Body Positive Approaches to Weight and Health Are Still Essential How to Address Healthy Lifestyle Choices With Kids Tips for Addressing Your Child\u2019s Whole Body Health Parents/Getty Images Obesity can lead to health problems, but children need compassion, not body shaming. The language that we use to talk to kids about their weight can impact their mental health. You are your child's best role model for healthy living. All parents worry about their kids' physical health, and sometimes that means keeping a close (non-judgmental) eye on their weight. And now it might even more important to pay attention on what and how your child eats: A new study published inLancetprojects that by 2050, about a third of all children and teens will beobese or overweight. This is distressing news, given the health implications of these conditions for kids, such asincreased risk of diabetes, high blood pressure, anxiety, and depression.But it also raises concerns about body shame, and perpetuating harmful stereotypes about children who live in larger bodies. We connected with twobody-positive pediatriciansto help us understand this study, and to share some holistic, compassionate ways to address body weight and health with children. **What to Know About the Research** The research, published in a March, 2025 edition ofLancet, looked at 204 countries around the world, and their body weight statistics. The researchers found that overweight andobesity ratesin both adults and children over the past three decades\u2014from 1990 to 2021\u2014have more than doubled. Moreover, the study researchers projected that by 2050, about 60% of adults and 31% of kids and teens will be overweight or obese. As such, the study researchers call for urgent policy changes in governments and public health to support treatment for overweight and obese children, as well as preventative strategies. \u201cThe unprecedented global epidemic of overweight and obesity is a profound tragedy and a monumental societal failure,\u201d lead study author,Professor Emmanuela Gakidou, said in a press release. \u201cGovernments and the public health community can use our country-specific estimates on the stage, timing, and speed of current and forecasted transitions in weight to identify priority populations experiencing the greatest burdens of obesity who require immediate intervention and treatment, and those that remain predominantly overweight and should be primarily targeted with prevention strategies,\u201d the release continued. **Body Positive Approaches to Weight and Health Are Still Essential** WhileWendy Schofer, MD, a pediatrician and founder of Family in Focus, shares some of the same concerns with the authors of this study, she objects to some of the language used by the study researchers. \u201cThe research is projecting further increases in the prevalence of obesity for adults and children worldwide, and it is very strongly noted to be a societal shortcoming according to the lead author, Professor Gakidou,\u201d says Dr. Schofer. However, Dr. Schofer says that the way we are framing obesity as a \u201ctragedy\u201d\u2014as quoted from the press release\u2014is harmful for those living in larger bodies. **Why the language used in the study matters** Dr. Schofer says that instead of focusing on a \u201ctragedy\u201d we are trying to avoid, we need to focus on what we are doing here and now and what changes we want to see to public health to make sure kids are healthy. What does that look like? \u201cThis starts in the home long before we see anything on a societal level,\u201d she says. \u201cIn all societies, that is talking about focus onnutritious foods,safe spaces to playand explore, [and] learning and social activities that are creative and nourish the whole body.\u201d Importantly, says Dr. Schofer, preventing these health problems means creatingpositive relationships to foodand our bodies, and an awareness of theimpact that our emotions can haveon our habits and behaviors. \u201cThis research needs to be framed as a call for cultural change for all members of a society, not just those of a certain age or body size,\u201d she emphasizes. **Related Stories** **How to Address Healthy Lifestyle Choices With Kids** Weight issues shouldn\u2019t be ignored, because they impact your child\u2019s health now and in the future. Children with a BMI that falls in the overweight or obese category may have an increased risk of health conditions like type 2 diabetes, elevated cholesterol, sleep apnea, high blood pressure, and bone/joint issues according to the Academy of American Pediatrics (AAP). Treating obesity early decreases these risks. But focusing heavily on your child\u2019s body size and unhealthy habits can induce body shame, and can increase their risk of developing adisordered eating pattern. And in fact, using BMI as a measure of health can bemisleading and outdated. That\u2019s why taking a holistic, compassionate approach to dealing with these issues is crucial. \u201cAs a pediatrician, a father, and someone who was overweight as a child, I see the profound impact this research can have\u2014but only if we approach it with compassion and perspective,\u201d saysIlan Shapiro, MDat AltaMed Health Services, who oversees a childhood obesity program. \u201cThe key takeaway is this: childhood health is not just about calories in and out. It's about the full environment our kids grow up in\u2014what they eat, where they play, how they sleep, their mental health, and yes, the examples they see at home, he explains. **Start with 'connection over correction'** Dr. Shapiro says that children don\u2019t need lectures about eating or healthy lifestyle choices. That usually only increases shame. What they need isconnection over correction, he says. What might that look like? Here are some ways to connect, rather than correct, according to Dr. Shapiro: Instead of saying, \u201cYou need to eat healthier,\u201d try saying, \u201cOur bodies are amazing. Let\u2019s find foods that make them feel strong and focused.\u201d Focus on how food and habits feel, not how they look. For example, you might say, \u201cDid that snack give you good energy or make you feel sleepy?\u201d Use \u201cwe\u201d language when possible. This might look like saying: \u201cLet\u2019s try drinking more water this week as a family.\u201d Lastly, kids are little sponges, so setting positive examples whenever possible is essential. \u201cKids copy what they see, not just what they hear,\u201d Dr. Shapiro says. \u201cSo the most powerful message is watching us choose movement, enjoy fruits and vegetables, and talk kindly about our own bodies.\u201d **Tips for Addressing Your Child\u2019s Whole Body Health** So what are some more tangible actions you can take to keep your child healthy? Here are tips from Dr. Shapiro: Make movement playful and a time to connect. Try family walks, dance parties, or make park time an opportunity for bonding. Cook together: Kids are more likely to tryhealthy foodsif they help prepare them. Make water and rest rituals part of your day. Consider special water bottles, bedtime stories, and no screens before bed to help everyone recharge. Joyful swaps: Instead of restricting foods, offer fun alternatives, such as frozen fruit pops, smoothie bowls, or yogurt with cinnamon and fruit. Most importantly, says Dr. Shapiro, make health a team effort. \u201cIf kids see us trying, laughing, failing, and trying again\u2014they\u2019ll know that wellness isn\u2019t about perfection,\u201d he advises. \u201cIt\u2019s about consistency, curiosity, and care.\u201d Finally, if you have any questions about your child\u2019s health or body size, don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to your pediatrician, preferably one who is body positive and affirming. If your child lives with body image issues or has signs of disordered eating, please reach out to a therapist or eating disorder specialist for help and support.
