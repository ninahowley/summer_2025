Student protesters claim partial victory, vote to pack up. It all swings on an email from uni HQ** After weeks of tensions and a stalemate around the student occupation of the Arts West building, pro-Palestine protest organisers announced a partial victory tonight and signalled they would pack up and go home. But not until university administrators confirm the claimed deal.James CostaandThe Citizenteam report. \u201cThe university will be sending an email out tomorrow (Thursday), to all students and staff, making a public commitment that the university will disclose all of its relationships, not only with defence \u2026 but when it comes to all research\u201d: Unimelb for Palestine organiser Hiba addresses protesters this evening. Photo by James Costa Pro-Palestine student protesters at the University of Melbourne have tonight (Wednesday) claimed a partial victory in their months-long campaign demanding that the university disclose and divest links to weapons manufacturers involved in the Israel-Hamas war. After a week of tense negotiations, threats and a stalemate around the student occupation of the Arts West building, \u201cUnimelb for Palestine\u201d organisers told a crowd of about 40 assembled activists that the university had undertaken to disclose relationships and review its ethical research policies. Protesters gathered at the South Lawn \u201cGaza Solidarity Encampment\u201d \u2013 now in its 28th day \u2013 voted to pack up and leave if the deal was confirmed. At 8.30pm Wednesday, responding to questions fromThe Citizenabout the claims, a university media spokesperson would neither confirm or deny them, releasing a one-line statement: \u201cWe welcome the willingness of the occupiers to leave the Arts West building and remove the encampment from our Parkville campus.\u201d Addressing activists at 5pm, protest organiser Hiba, who did not want to give her last name, announced: \u201cThe university will be sending an email out tomorrow (Thursday), to all students and staff, making a public commitment that the university will disclose all of its relationships, not only with defence \u2026 but when it comes to all research\u201d. Hiba said that the university was \u201cnot budging on divestment, at all\u201d. But the deal would mean that researchers\u2019 profiles on their \u201cfind an expert\u201d public pages would include details of collaborator companies, including financial contributions. She said the talks had not secured an undertaking by the university not to take disciplinary action against students, but they had managed to negotiate that action down from\u201cimmediate orders\u201d issued by the vice chancellor, which can impose serious and wide-ranging restrictions on a student, to lower order \u201cgeneral misconduct\u201d via a \u201cstudent disciplinary committee\u201d. The university hasnumerous publicly recognised ties with weapons manufacturers, including a$3.5 million \u201ccollaboration\u201d with Lockheed Martin, an\u201cindustrial project\u201d with BAE Systems and a partnership with Boeing. \u201cUnimelb for Palestine\u201d organisers\u2013 a \u201cnon-affiliated, grassroots\u201d group of students, alumni and staff \u2013 claim that the Arts West sit-in was a spontaneous action not organised by them, and that protesters still inside the building are an \u201cunaffiliated autonomous group\u201d. Nonetheless, Hiba said that they would also pack up if the deal was confirmed. Both groups are demanding that the university divests and discloses ties with weapons manufacturers and, in their words, condems \u201cthe genocide in Gaza\u201d. Israel has repeatedly denied claims of genocide. Protesters also claimed that the university would review its ethics and due diligence policy, as well as host an open lecture series starting next semester to hear from both sides on the Israel-Palestine conflict. Dana Al-shaer, a leading organiser with Unimelb for Palestine, toldThe Citizenthat it was \u201cone of the wins, and one of the demands for protesters but it is not the end of the journey. \u201cIt definitely shows the power of students and staff and the broader community to make the university shift its language and policies, as they moved from transparency to full disclosure in the matter of a week,\u201d Al-shaer said. \u201cThis does not mean that we will stop, there is a long way to go \u2026 divestment remains as the one priority that we are going to work towards, so we are not going to stop protesting, we\u2019re just going to conclude the encampment\u201d. The fallout for activists is now front of mind for many. \u201cIt is a gross injustice if the university were to punish students who are carrying out the values of political expression and academic freedom that the university extols\u201d, said Al-shaer. **More stories inPolitics** **Police and protestors clash as mining conference enters second day** Photos byLiam Petterson **Police and protestors clash as mining conference enters second day** Photos byLiam Petterson **For second year running, student podcasts win honours in New York** Story byGwen Liu **For second year running, student podcasts win honours in New York** Story byGwen Liu **\u2018It\u2019s during moments of political crises that these questions of motivation and obligation are put under the microscope.\u2019** Interview byDerrick Krusche **\u2018It\u2019s during moments of political crises that these questions of motivation and obligation are put under the microscope.\u2019** Interview byDerrick Krusche **Victoria\u2019s Question Time revamp is a case of back to the future** Words byScott Tibballs **Victoria\u2019s Question Time revamp is a case of back to the future** Words byScott Tibballs **About The Citizen** THE CITIZEN is a publication of the Centre for Advancing Journalism.
