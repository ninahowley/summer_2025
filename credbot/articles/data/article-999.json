While social media has opened doors for reporters to reach wider audiences with accessible content, these platforms create additional challenges in the dissemination of credible information. Ahead of World Press Freedom Day on May 3, the News Literacy Project hosted a conversation with reporterMeghann Cuniff, a longtime legal affairs journalist, about researching and reporting high-profile legal proceedings, including the role of social media in covering cases involving celebrities like Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs and Megan Thee Stallion. Preview Cuniff\u2019s approach to uncovering events inside the courtroom below and pick up strategies for teaching students about the role of a free press. For more,view the webinar in fullon edWeb. **\ud83e\ude84 Demystify high-profile news** Journalists like Cuniff transform complex events into comprehensible reports so the public can stay informed. To make the details of celebrity trials accessible, Cuniff often posts live updates on social media. The platforms create an \u201cescape from the paywalled world of legal journalism,\u201d she said. With this alternative to limited access to articles from legal journals, more people can gain an understanding of what is happening in the courtroom. Cuniff\u2019s role is especially important given the level of public interest, especially among young people, in high-profile, celebrity trials. With many eyes and ears on these proceedings, Cuniff knows she has a responsibility to ensure that her readers\u2019 understanding of the case and of the legal system itself is shaped accurately. \u201cThere are so many people paying attention to [celebrity cases], that it really shapes their view of the legal system. It\u2019s crucial to provide some education there.\u201d **\ud83e\udd33 Understand citizen journalism** With the decline of many traditional newsrooms around the country, citizen journalists, or individuals without formal journalism training who gather and share information on news events, have stepped onto the scene. While citizen journalists may unlock information that would not have otherwise been widely available, their existence emphasizes the need to ask questions about the basis for a reported story, Cuniff said. Citizen journalists often are not trained in the standards or ethical practices of professional journalists. News literacy skills like understandingstandards of quality journalismand investigating the source help ensure that internet users can sort through credible reporting and avoid spreading falsehoods. \u201cIt\u2019s a good reminder about the need to educate people about news literacy, what you\u2019re reading, what you\u2019re consuming, and who\u2019s using primary sources.\u201d **\ud83d\udca8 Take a breath** When reporting a trial, Cuniff may only have a ten-minute break in the action to post updates for readers. To ensure that she does not sacrifice accuracy in her mission to get breaking news out quickly, Cuniff has a simple practice: taking a deep breath and slowing down. Cuniff prioritizes using her news judgment to get the basic, most important details out first, recognizing that the nuances of the story can come later, once they have been confirmed. Just as Cuniff does when she is reporting breaking news, readers can follow the same practice of slowing down and pausing before sharing information online. Taking a few extra minutes to explore the source behind a claim and looking for confirmation from multiple sources goes a long way in curbing the spread of falsehoods. \u201cIt\u2019s all about trying to take a deep breath and to calm down and then focus on the basics.\u201d **Do your students know their First Amendment Rights?** A core standard of news literacy involves acknowledging the importance of the First Amendment and a free press to an informed public. In \u201cThe First Amendment,\u201d a FREE interactive lesson on the Checkology\u00ae virtual classroom, students learn why the First Amendment\u2019s five rights and freedoms are vital to American democracy. Through case studies, they will weigh in on Supreme Court decisions in which these protections were challenged. **MoreUpdates** **ForEducationWeek,educatorssharehowtheyteachstudentstoquestionhealthinfluencers** An opinion piece in EducationWeek by two educators from New York featured the News Literacy Project\u2019s District Fellowship program.
