The new equipment allowed photographers to move more freely and capture higher quality footage, improving the overall news broadcast.\u201cIt proved to be a very good format, very reliable, very rugged,\u201d Terry Van Bibber, Chief Engineer at WISH-TV said. \u201cAnd those are exceptional qualities for us.\u201dIn the early days of television, formats were constantly evolving. By the 1980s, VHS and Betamax were the two main contenders for video tape formats, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. VHS tapes were known for their longer recording times and lower cost, while Betamax offered higher quality but at a higher price.Television stations, however, had different requirements than consumers. According to Terry Van Bibber, the Betamax format used by broadcasters was much higher quality than the home VCR Betamax machine, designed specifically for broadcast purposes.The adoption of Sony Betacams at WISH-TV was a pivotal moment. Steve Sweitzer, Chief Photographer, recalled the excitement of the transition, likening it to Christmas when the new Betacams were distributed. The new equipment was more mobile and durable, making it easier for photographers to do their jobs effectively.Bruce McConnell, the owner of WISH-TV, had been an early adopter of video technology, purchasing the first video tape machine for the station in 1956. This forward-thinking approach continued with the adoption of Betacams, positioning WISH-TV at the forefront of broadcast technology.The introduction of Sony Betacams at WISH-TV not only improved the station\u2019s broadcast quality but also set a precedent for other stations to follow. The enhanced mobility and reliability of the new format allowed photographers to capture news more effectively, serving the station well for decades.WEB EXTRAS:The rise of consumer cameras (1987)This video features three news packages that aired in Oct. 26,1987.Mike Androvett and chief photographer Steve Sweitzer demonstrate for viewers how to buy and best operate a VHS camcorder.
