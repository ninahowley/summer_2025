One encounter has already turned violent. On Tuesday, anti-ICE activists assaulted police during what they believed to be an immigration raid in Peoria. DEVELOPING: Protests against a supposed ICE raid in Peoria, Ariz. devolves into a chaotic situation.@LaurenCFox10captured this escalation between some there and officers. Peoria PD tells us this HSI bust was about narcotics \u2013 not immigration.@FOX10Phoenixpic.twitter.com/Ay5COL4QE9 \u2014 Trenton Hooker (@trentonhooker)June 10, 2025 The activists turned up to confront police after receiving a community alert from the Party for Socialism and Liberation of Phoenix. The Peoria Police Department (PPD) issued a statement to correct the record: the Homeland Security Investigation (HSI) operation in Peoria concerned a search warrant for a drug investigation \u2014 not immigration enforcement. \u201cDuring the incident, misinformation circulated online, drawing protesters to the scene under the false belief it involved immigration enforcement,\u201d stated PPD. \u201cUnfortunately, the situation escalated when a suspect assaulted a police officer, and the crowd\u2019s behavior became increasingly disruptive.\u201d https://x.com/PeoriaPoliceAZ/status/1932548341755490778 The Peoria Police Department is among Arizona\u2019s finest, and they did a wonderful job de-escalating a chaotic situation. It is disappointing to see Maricopa County Supervisor Steve Gallardo was so quick to spread misinformation and throw law enforcement under the bus. Arizona\u2026https://t.co/Sp42hMGQv3 \u2014 Office of Congressman Abe Hamadeh (@RepAbeHamadeh)June 11, 2025 Progress Arizona, one of the leading dark money-funded nonprofits in the state, sent out a community alert defending their activists\u2019 involvement. The nonprofit made no apologies about the assault on an officer. \u201cToday, Arizonans came together to show support for immigrants by bearing witness to law enforcement actions, and to protect individuals\u2019 constitutional rights in various locations across the valley, including at the intersection of 67th and Peoria avenues based on reports of ICE presence,\u201d said Progress Arizona. The nonprofit included a statement from an involved activist and former state representative, John Loredo, promising more activist presence wherever they believe immigration enforcements may take place. \u201cThis is going to be the norm from now on; Arizonans will respond to defend our communities and protect our constitutional rights,\u201d said Loredo. \u201cWe have resisted these attacks before, and we will do so again by preparing people for ICE raids now in a movement rooted in mutual support and community care.\u201d Another ex-lawmaker (now spokesperson for activist organization Proyecto Progreso, which coordinated with Progress Arizona), Raquel Teran, said they would \u201cpeacefully observe and document\u201d to ensure illegal immigrants\u2019 rights weren\u2019t violated during immigration enforcement proceedings. Proyecto Progreso launched earlier this year as a coalition of Spanish-language media outlets and progressive organizations in response to the Trump administration\u2019s mass deportation efforts. In addition to Progress Arizona, their \u201ccommunity allies\u201d are One Arizona, Mi Familia Vota, Corazon, Arizona Working Families Party, Arizona Democracy Resource Center, TheyBirth TheyArt, CHISPA, Poder Latinx, Arizona AANHPI, and Arizona Center for Empowerment. The organization\u2019s \u201cmedia allies\u201d are Conecta Arizona, La Onda, 101.9 Campesina, La Reyna Radio, Entre Mujeres Radio, Prensa Arizona, Mary Rabago Productions, Chavez Media, and Contacto Total Radio. Proyecto Progreso offers connection to free legal advice and representation through the Legal Assistance Program for Mexicans through External Legal Counsel (PALE) \u2014 a program funded by the Mexican government. These activists have support from their Democratic elected officials. Maricopa County Supervisor Steve Gallardo joined protesters in defending their interruption of police operations. Gallardo declared illegal immigrants had a constitutional right to remain in the country. \u201cIt\u2019s a sad day not only for Arizona but particularly for the city of Peoria. I\u2019m kind of shocked to see the coordination within the city of Peoria and the federal government,\u201d said Gallardo. \u201cPolice here in Peoria took an oath to uphold the Constitution, people that are being taken away \u2014 yeah they do have rights that need to be protected.\u201d Governor Katie Hobbs spoke against Tuesday\u2019s show of violence \u2014 though this latest statement may have come across as mixed messaging, given her recent response to the California riots. \u201cViolence is completely unacceptable, and I urge any protesters to remain peaceful,\u201d said Hobbs. https://x.com/GovernorHobbs/status/1932558919072952817 The governor\u2019s statement addressing the Los Angeles riots may have led anti-ICE activists to believe she would look the other way or even support acts of violence. Hobbs signed onto a letter condemning President Donald Trump\u2019s deployment of the National Guard over the weekend in response to the ongoing riots in Los Angeles, California. Maricopa County Attorney Rachel Mitchell pledged to hold rioters accountable for their actions. \u201cThis afternoon, people in the area of 67th Avenue and Cheryl Drive made a bad decision and an officer was hurt. While their assumption that he was involved in an immigration enforcement was wrong, let me be clear: assaulting a police officer, or hurting another person, or damaging property for any reason is not acceptable and those who do so will be held accountable for their unlawful actions.\u201d https://x.com/Rachel1Mitchell/status/1932587613049008624 Self-Proclaimed \u201cElection Integrity\u201d Crusader Austin Smith Indicted for Election Fraud Self-Proclaimed \u201cElection Integrity\u201d Crusader Austin Smith Indicted for Election Fraud Mesays:June 11, 2025 at 3:23 amBOOK\u2019EM !
