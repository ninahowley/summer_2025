Sami, whose last name we are withholding to protect his security, stares into his own eyes and whispers the same question: \u201cHow will I feed my children today?\u201d It\u2019s a question no parent should ever have to ask. But for Sami, a father of six from central Gaza, it\u2019s become his cruel daily ritual. Ever since Israel fullyclosed the blockadeof Gaza in early March, humanitarian aid organizations have been completely shut out of the region, leaving no way to deliver crucial supplies such asfood, medicine, and fuel. The United Nations has called this aman-madefamine. Families like Sami\u2019s are living it. Sami used to be a taxi driver, making a stable living that enabled his family to live a joyful and dignified life in Gaza City. But in April 2024, his taxi\u2019s engine gave out after weeks of fleeing from one neighborhood to another under bombardment. Sami says repairs are far beyond what he can afford\u2014if the spare parts are even available in the region anymore\u2014leaving him with no source of income. Now, Sami and his family of eight\u2014including a six-month-old baby boy\u2014are living on meals of salt dissolved in warm water. \u201cWe boil water and add salt to it,\u201d he tells me, his voice cracking. \u201cIt tricks our stomachs into thinking we\u2019ve eaten something. We do this to survive.\u201d As I speak to Sami, his daughters, Sama, Soud, and Noura, sit quietly in a corner, too weak to complain. His older sons, Mohammed and Rezek, take turns searching for any leftover scraps from previous aid distributions by humanitarian organizations like the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA). But those rations ran out weeks ago. His wife, Mariam, tries to keep hope alive with whatever is left in their house. \u201cI make a pot of soup\u2014just water with a little spice or rice if we\u2019re lucky,\u201d she says. \u201cWe stretch it the whole day for everyone. It\u2019s not food. It\u2019s survival.\u201d The couple\u2019s youngest son, Abdel-Rahman, is just six months old. He depends on formula to survive, but the baby formula shelves have long been empty, and Mariam, weakened by hunger herself, can\u2019t produce enough milk to breastfeed him. More than 2,700 children in Gaza under the age of five werediagnosedwith acute malnutrition in the second half of May alone. According to the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC),more than halfof Gaza\u2019s population\u2014around 1.1 million people\u2014is facing \u201cemergency\u201d level food insecurity, while 22 percent face \u201ccatastrophe,\u201d which is the highest level of hunger classified by the United Nations. That includes more than3,500 childrenunder the age of five at immediate risk of dying from starvation-related causes, according to Gaza\u2019s Government Media Office. Fifty-seven children have alreadydiedfrom starvation. Yet, the borders remain closed. Before the war, Gaza\u2019s aid and goodsflowed throughthe Kerem Shalom and Rafah crossings. Since March, Israeli military orders havesealed both shut. International aid convoys have beenblocked or bombedand U.N. warehouses have beenlooted or destroyed. The U.N. World Food Programmewarnedin mid-May that if access is not restored immediately, \u201cfamine will become widespread, and irreversible damage will be done to the people of Gaza\u2014especially children.\u201d Sami sees that damage unfolding right in front of him. \u201cThis isn\u2019t war. This is starvation as a weapon,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are being sentenced to death in silence.\u201d In April, Human Rights Watch accused Israel ofusing starvationas a method of warfare, a potential war crime under international law. Still, political negotiations stall, and the blockade tightens. \u201cWe feel forgotten,\u201d Mariam says. \u201cBut we are still here, trying to stay alive, trying to keep our children breathing.\u201d As we speak, Abdel-Rahman stirs in her arms, his cheeks pale and his tiny lips trembling. She rocks him gently and hums a lullaby\u2014one she barely has the strength to sing. **Tags** **Nourdine Shnino** Nourdine Shnino is a news editor, feature story writer, and freelance journalist from the Gaza Strip.
