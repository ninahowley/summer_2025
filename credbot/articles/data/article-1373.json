of China, were charged in a criminal complaint with conspiracy, smuggling goods into the United States, false statements, and visa fraud, announced United States Attorney Jerome F. Gorgon, Jr. Gorgon was joined in the announcement by Special Agent in Charge Cheyvoryea Gibson, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Detroit Division and Marty C. Raybon, Director of Field Operations, U.S. Customs and Border Protection. The FBI arrested Jian in connection with allegations related to Jian\u2019s and Liu\u2019s smuggling into America a fungus called Fusarium graminearum, which scientific literature classifies as a potential agroterrorism weapon. This noxious fungus causes \u201chead blight,\u201d a disease of wheat, barley, maize and rice, and is responsible for billions of dollars in economic losses worldwide each year. Fusarium graminearum\u2019s toxins cause vomiting, liver damage and reproductive defects in humans and livestock. According to the complaint, Jian received Chinese government funding for her work on this pathogen in China. The complaint also alleges that Jian\u2019s electronics contain information describing her membership in and loyalty to the Chinese Communist Party. It is further alleged that Jian\u2019s boyfriend, Liu, works at a Chinese university where he conducts research on the same pathogen and that he first lied but then admitted to smuggling Fusarium graminearum into America \u2014 through the Detroit Metropolitan Airport \u2014 so that he could conduct research on it at the laboratory at the University of Michigan where his girlfriend, Jian, worked. United States Attorney Gorgon stated, \u201cThe alleged actions of these Chinese nationals \u2014 including a loyal member of the Chinese Communist Party \u2014 are of the gravest national security concerns. These two aliens have been charged with smuggling a fungus that has been described as a \u2018potential agroterrorism weapon\u2019 into the heartland of America, where they apparently intended to use a University of Michigan laboratory to further their scheme.\u201d PROTECTING AMERICANS \u201cThe federal charges announced today against Yunqing Jian and Zunyong Liu, both residents of the People\u2019s Republic of China, signify a crucial advancement in our efforts to safeguard our communities and uphold national security,\u201d said Cheyvoryea Gibson, special agent in charge of the FBI Detroit Field Office. \u201cThese individuals exploited their access to laboratory facilities at a local university to engage in the smuggling of biological pathogens, an act that posed an imminent threat to public safety. Thanks to the exceptional investigative efforts of the FBI Detroit Counterintelligence Task Force, in close cooperation with U.S. Customs and Border Protection\u2019s Office of Field Operations these dangerous activities have been effectively halted. The FBI remains resolutely committed to collaborating with our law enforcement partners to protect the residents of Michigan and defend the United States against such grave threats.\u201d U.S. Custom and Border Protection, Director of Field Operations Marty C. Raybon stated, \u201cToday\u2019s criminal charges levied upon Yunqing Jian and Zunyong Liu are indicative of CBP\u2019s critical role in protecting the American people from biological threats that could devastate our agricultural economy and cause harm to humans; especially when it involves a researcher from a major university attempting to clandestinely bring potentially harmful biological materials into the United States. This was a complex investigation involving CBP offices from across the country, alongside our federal partners. I\u2019m grateful for their tireless efforts, ensuring our borders remain secure from all types of threats while safeguarding America\u2019s national security interests.\u201d Jian will be appearing this afternoon in federal court in Detroit for her initial appearance on the complaint. A complaint is only a charge and is not evidence of guilt. Trial cannot be held on felony charges in a complaint. When the investigation is completed, a determination will be made whether to seek a felony indictment. The FBI and CBP are investigating this case.
