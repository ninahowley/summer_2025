Thanks for visiting! **Author ofBe Ready for AnythingandBloom Where You\u2019re Plantedonline course** Nothing is more of a summer tradition here at our house than making enough homemade jam from fresh fruit to see us through the winter. Get some fruit, some sugar, and a box of pectin and you\u2019re good to go, right? Not so fast! You can actually make jam without pectin if you use my favoriteold-fashioned methodof thickening your product. (Find this canning recipe and many more in my book,The Prepper\u2019s Canning Guide.) **Why You Might Want to Make Your Jam WITHOUT Pectin** As the name of this website implies, we like to keep things nourishing and natural. A while back, I spent some time reading up onstore-bought pectinand I was very unhappy to discover the jams I had been making for my family have been tainted with GMOs. I had unknowingly been contaminating the carefully sourced fruit and pricey turbinado sugar with the very things I strive to avoid, and I hadn\u2019t even given it a second thought. Most brands exclaim breathlessly, \u201cAll natural pectin\u201d or \u201cMade from real fruit\u201d. And this is true \u2013 it does originate from fruit. Sound okay, right? Don\u2019t be deceived. This misleading label makes it sound as though this is nothing more than some powdered fruit. Storebought pectin contains additives that are most likely genetically modified. Dextrose is generally made from corn products (GMOs that are absolutely SOAKED in glyphosate). It is made from cornstarch, the main ingredient in good old High Fructose Corn Syrup. Don\u2019t let anyone tell you that citric acid is \u201cjust Vitamin C\u201d. It is derivedfrom GMO mold. Not only does store-bought pectin contain unsavory ingredients, but it is also very highly processed.According to Wikipedia, this is how it is produced: The main raw materials for pectin production are dried citrus peel or apple pomace, both by-products of juice production. Pomace from sugar beet is also used to a small extent. From these materials, pectin is extracted by adding hot dilute acid at pH-values from 1.5 \u2013 3.5. During several hours of extraction, the protopectin loses some of its branching and chain length and goes into solution. After filtering, the extract is concentrated in vacuum and the pectin then precipitated by adding ethanol or isopropanol. An old technique of precipitating pectin with aluminium salts is no longer used (apart from alcohols and polyvalent cations, pectin also precipitates with proteins and detergents). Alcohol-precipitated pectin is then separated, washed and dried. Treating the initial pectin with dilute acid leads to low-esterified pectins. When this process includes ammonium hydroxide, amidated pectins are obtained. After drying and milling, pectin is usually standardised with sugar and sometimes calcium salts or organic acids to have optimum performance in a particular application. (source) **Old-fashioned jam-making methods** So, if you want to avoid GMOs and processed foods, what\u2019s a homemade-jam making mama to do? Jam has been around for thousands of years. The first known book of jam recipes was written in Rome in the 1st century (source). Since I\u2019m pretty sure our ancestors didn\u2019t have those handy little boxes ofSure-JellorRealFruitorCertositting in their pantries, I set out to learn how they made a thick delicious preserve to spread on their biscuits. My first attempt at breaking up with the box was to make my own pectin with green apples. While I ended up with a tasty product, it wasn\u2019t really jam-like. It\u2019s possible, considering the time of year, that the apples were too ripe to allow this to work for me. You can find instructions on how to make your own pectin from applesHERE. I continued to read recipes and methods from days gone by. It soon became clear that adding pectin wasn\u2019t really necessary at all. In days past, the sugar and the fruit worked hand-in-hand to create the desired consistency. If you are determined to use pectin (some fancier jams are nicer with a thicker set-up) I strongly recommendPomona\u2019s Universal Pectin, a non-GMO, non-toxic pectin. Don\u2019t be put off by the higher price \u2013 you can get several batches of jam from one packet of pectin, so it works out to a similar cost as the yucky stuff. I combined bits from a few different methods and finally came up with a jam that the entire family was happy with. In comparison with the boxed pectin jam, it doesn\u2019t gel quite as much, but after trying this jam, the texture of the other now seems slightly artificial to me. This produces an artisanal jam, a softer preserve with an incredibly intense fruit flavor. When using this method, you don\u2019t get that layer of foam that you have to skim off the top as you do with the boxed pectin method. And best of all, you get two products for the price of one. You\u2019ll have an additional sweet juice or syrup at the end of your process. **How to Make Jam without Pectin** First of all, I want to encourage you not to be deterred by the lengthy amount of time to make this jam. Very little of that time is spent hands-on. Nearly all of it is draining time. You\u2019ll end up cooking your fruit down for far less time than the standard pectin-included method, and your fruit will taste fruitier because it\u2019s so concentrated. Give it a try! You\u2019ll be hooked! 7 pounds of fresh or frozen fruit (approximately 14-20 cups) \u00bc cup of lemon or lime juice 3 cups + 2 tbsp of sugar* A piece of clean, non-linty cotton fabric for draining (I used aflour sack towel. This will be permanently stained, so don\u2019t use something you want to keep pretty.) *I\u2019ve experimented \u2013 you can even useno sugarat all, but this seems to be the happy place for my family\u2019s preferences. **Directions:** Prepare your fruit. For berries, this means washing them and sorting them, removing little leaves and twigs, as well as berries that are shriveled. For fruits like apples or peaches, this might mean blanching and peeling them, then removing the cores. Leave the odd green bit of fruit in, because less ripe fruit has more naturally occurring pectin than ripe fruit. Mash, finely chop, or puree your fruit. I used a blender to puree half of the fruit, and a food processor to finely chop the other half. We prefer a rough puree texture. Pour this into a large crock or non-reactive bowl, layering your fruit with half of the sugar. I use the ceramic insert from my crock-pot for this.If you aren\u2019t using sugar, skip ahead to step 5. Leave the fruit and sugar mixture in your refrigerator overnight. The juice from the fruit will combine with the sugar and form a slightly gelled texture. Some liquid will separate from the sugar and fruit. The next day, line a colander with a flour sack towel. Place the colander into a pot to catch the liquid from the fruit and sugar mixture. Pour your fruit and sugar mixture into the fabric-lined colander.If you are not using sugar, let it drain overnight. If you are using sugar, put this back in the refrigerator for at least an hour to drain. You can let it drain for longer with no ill effect \u2013 in fact, this will result in an even thicker jam. **From this point on, you\u2019ll be making two separate products: jam and fruit syrup.** When you\u2019re ready to make jam, scoop the fruit out of the fabric-lined colander and place it in a pot with lots of open area to help it cook down faster. (This gives more space for the liquid to evaporate.) The liquid that you caught in the other pot is the basis for your fruit syrup (or juice if you aren\u2019t using sugar). You\u2019ll have about 1-2 pints of liquid. Place that on the stove and bring it to a rolling boil. Add 1/4 cup of sugar and a tbsp of lemon juice per pint and reduce heat to a simmer. I like to add one big spoonful of jam to this to add a little texture to the syrup. Meanwhile, on another burner, add lemon juice and bring your fruit and sugar mixture to a simmer, stirring frequently. After about an hour, the texture will have thickened. If you still have a great deal of liquid, you can use a fabric lined sieve to strain some more out. (You can add this liquid to the syrup.) Fillsanitized jarswith your products (syrup or jam). Process the jam in awater bath canner, according to the type of fruit you are canning andmaking adjustments for your altitude. Refer to the chart below for processing times. And there you have it\u2026it\u2019s easy to make an intensely fruity artisanal jam without pectin! **Universal Jam Making Chart** The processing times are based on sea level. Adjust these times based on your altitude. FRUIT SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS PROCESSING TIME ***Note: Since this article was written, I\u2019ve experimented with a no-sugar jam.

I don\u2019t like the idea of artificial chemicals either.By the by: I buy unbleached muslin in the 36\u2032 width for draining such things as this, making fresh mozarella cheese, covers for making my own vinegars, and of course straining infusions and jellies/juices. I make it also into tea bags and all sorts of things for foods. No bleach is important for sanitizing after washing, lemon juice in water then sunlight if possible. After all, if you can burn in cloudy weather, then those uv\u2019s are able to sanitize textiles too.Reply Thanks for all the information. I was given 2 large bags of apples.

Winniesays:May 28, 2017 at 11:03 amJust a quick tip that I use when preparing my strawberries for jam. We pick in quantity and clean, then slice and sugar for ice cream, or mash with no sugar to be used for jam. I measure out 2 cups each and place in ziplock bags and freeze on their sides, in a cake pan with the strawberries spread out and stacked on top of each other. (Once frozen you can retrieve your cake pan.) The berries can then be used for a quick batch of jam when needed, and since I make freezer jam, this keeps my freezer from being filled with a million jars.This year I\u2019ll be trying to make my own pectin from crab apples and cranberries.

Dougsays:June 23, 2017 at 9:51 pmI have been canning for a few years. 1 thing to save a lot of work is too put my jars in the oven at 250 for no less than 25 mins instead water-bath them for user.

I put them in a pan with a big lip so when I remove them & they slide they won\u2019t fall out of the pan.This will sterilize them & get them hot for canning.

Maybe cook it down a bit. Add the chia seeds. You can add them a bit at a time, to try to adjust the thickness. The whole thing will thicken up after an hour or two and also when cold. You can \u201ccan\u201d this like jam or freeze it.Though I have not tried it yet, I am sure you could use the chia seed method to make raw freezer jam.The end texture is different than traditional jam, but it is very thick and spreadable and so far tastes great. I have made Cherry and Wild Blueberry so far. I just use organic frozen fruit, since I don\u2019t have any fruit plants at present.Nice thing is Chia Seeds can be grown at home, so it is sustainable. They are healthy and easy to store and use.If one is growing their own fruit, sugar (beet or cane or sorghum or honey), lemons and chia seeds; then making jam would never take going to the store.Hope you or anyone finds this interesting.Thank you for all the articles.

Keep a saucer in the freezer to place a dab onto to test for thickness as jam gets thicker as it cools. Quince is also an oldtime addition to fruit to make it thicken.I use my steamer-juicer to separate the juice from fruits, including tomatoes. The resulting pulp can be strained of seeds and tough skins and then either used for jam or dried for roll-ups. The juice from this is pretty concentrated and will need to be thinned before drinking\u2013also sweetened to taste. Can the juice, still hot, 10 minutes to seal. If your jars are clean, as they certainly should be!!, the 10 min. water bath will sterilize them. Tomato juice made like this looks strange, but tastes like essence of tomato.

Daisy Luthersays:September 17, 2020 at 3:18 pmYou have a few options.Depending on the size of the seeds (and I think they\u2019re bigger) you might be able to use aa stainless steel colander. Use the back of a big spoon to \u201cpush\u201d the fruit through the holes and the seeds will remain.If this is something you\u2019ll be making regularly (or something like it) you may wish to invest in a food mill. I have this onehttps://amzn.to/35Rn7GNwith the accessory sethttps://amzn.to/35MgdlSbecause I\u2019ve always done a lot of canning.There are less expensive food mills that are highly reviewed. I can\u2019t personally vouch for them because I\u2019m never tried them. This one appears to be very popular.https://amzn.to/2ZKgQsAI hope this helps.

I do love the idea of straining off the liquid for another use. I am printing this one\u2026Earlier this spring I made a delicious violet jelly, but it does require pectin. I was just experimenting, not following any exact recipe. I didn\u2019t use enough pectin to set up completely, so it must be refrigerated. I should have just made syrup instead of jelly. I used cider vinegar instead of citrus, because DH is allergic to citrus. Came out really delicious! Just made a violet tea by pouring boiling water over a packed jar of flowers minus the stems. Let is soak for about an hour, although recipes call for overnight, then I added the strained liquid to a pan, added sugar to taste, vinegar to taste, and eyeballed the pectin. WOW, talk about a fruity, zingy delight! I will definitely make more next spring.I once read an article about making pectin from crab apples, because they contain more than regular apples do. I think one can find it with a quick internet search. I don\u2019t have a large fruiting crab apple tree on my property, but I know where a few are roadside, and I can pick those with impunity because they are in the easement. Will have to wash them well because of road dirt and exhaust fumes, but it has to be safer than the glyphosate in the corn!Reply Thanks for this timely article!
