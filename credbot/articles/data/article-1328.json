U.S. Space Force Col. Bree Fram said that as of June 7, she is on administrative leave from the service, pending separation, as a result of the Pentagon\u2019s ban on transgender troops. She told Task & Purpose Monday that she is at the end of her more than two-decade career in the armed forces. She spoke to Task & Purpose in her personal capacity, not in reflection of Pentagon policy. Fram, an astronautical engineer who previously served in the Air Force before moving to Space Force in 2021, was serving as director of requirements and integration for Space Force. In posts on social media, she said that her last official act was to pin medals on three people who served under her. The Department of Defense officials say they believe there are approximately 4,200 service members with gender dysphoria in the ranks, and that as of May 15, 1,000 had come forward to begin a so-called \u201cvoluntary\u201d separation process. Others who may later be identified and \u201cinvoluntarily\u201d separated could receive smaller compensation packages, officials say. \u201cPeople are on pins and needles. We\u2019re asking each other \u2018what do you know? What do we all know?\u2019 It\u2019s been really difficult,\u201d she told Task & Purpose on Monday. \u201cI want to stress that although this is labeled voluntarily, neither the \u2018voluntary\u2019 or \u2018involuntary\u2019 process is a choice, or what anyone wanted or would have done.\u201d Fram joined the military after Sept. 11, 2001, and came out as transgender in 2016, the same day that the Department of Defense lifted its ban on transgender service. She spent nearly 20 years in the Air Force, then moved to the Space Force in 2021. **Get Task & Purpose in Your Inbox** Get Task & Purpose in Your Inbox Get Task & Purpose in Your Inbox Sign up for Task & Purpose Today to get the latest in military news each morning, and The Pentagon Rundown for a weekly breakdown of the biggest stories every Friday.

Transgender service members, Fram said, \u201chave been operating in a vacuum,\u201d and are looking for more information from military leadership. The military\u2019s involuntary separation process fortransgender troops, which started on June 7, remains vague on details. Members in the reserves have until July 7 to choose to go through the voluntary separation process. The Air Force andNavyhave said that troops with certain years of service are eligible for early retirement in this process. **Dispute over negative separation codes** A technical but life-altering issue for troops, said Fram, is the \u201cseparation code\u201d under which they will leave the service. Most troops leaving the military are granted an \u201chonorable discharge,\u201d a separation code that indicates they left in good standing with no serious discipline issues or professional failures. Though the Pentagon has, at times, said that transgender troops with clean records would receive honorable discharges, but Fram said that\u2019s no longer clear. AMay 15 memofrom the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness said transgender enlisted personnel would be separated under the JFF separation code, meaning it was done by secretarial authority. Officers would be given a JDK code, which indicates on their service record that \u201ctheir continued service is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security\u201d \u2014 a black mark for troops in the job market, as it could prevent them from getting or maintaining security clearances that are required for certain jobs. Rachel VanLandingham, a retired Air Force lieutenant colonel and JAG, told Task & Purpose that the JDK separation code is usually reserved for matters such as mishandling classified information. Fram said that the main concern for them has been uncertainty over what is next. \u201cAnyone navigating a transition out of the military is put in a challenging position, but they have this extra burden of being labeled as dishonorable or liars,\u201d she said. Fram also noted that the separations will cause disruptions for ongoing operations as troops who are qualified for specific roles are \u201csuddenly gone.\u201d Fram\u2019s work focused on researching what capabilities and \u201cfight critical\u201d systems the Space Force will need to field in the next decade. It\u2019s specialized work drawing on her years of experience, which others in Space Force don\u2019t have, she said. Fram noted that units that have open transgender personnel have tried to do some planning to fill gaps left by separation, but replacing thousands of people across the military \u201cis not something that happens tomorrow.\u201d \u201cThe impact of this is not just on today. It stretches far into the future,\u201d she said. A few days before her final acts in her role, at a meeting with fellow officers, her colleagues were stunned to learned she was leaving the service and all shook her hand as the event broke up. \u201cWe served with our friends, our colleagues, with people who respected us, and now that\u2019s just missing,\u201d she said. **The latest on Task & Purpose** A Marine Corpsreply-all email apocalypsehas an incredible real-life ending Armyshuts downits sole active-duty information operations command Army plans to close more than20 base museumsin major reduction FormerGreen Beretnominated to top Pentagon position to oversee special ops The Navy\u2019s new recruiting commercial puts the \u2018dirt wars\u2019 in the past **Task & Purpose Video** Task & Purpose Video Task & Purpose Video Each week on Tuesdays and Fridays our team will bring you analysis of military tech, tactics, and doctrine. **Nicholas Slayton** **Contributing Editor** Nicholas Slayton is a Contributing Editor for Task & Purpose.
