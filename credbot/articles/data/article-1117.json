It included Oregon Governor Tina Kotek and Washington Governor Bob Ferguson, among many others. They indicated they were standing with California Governor Gavin Newsom, who characterized Trump\u2019s move as something that would worsen an already tense situation. Trump had announced the deployment of 2,000 California National Guard troops to the LA area after a second day of clashes between hundreds of protestors and federal immigration authorities in riot gear. \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s move to deploy California\u2019s National Guard is an alarming abuse of power. Governors are the Commanders in Chief of their National Guard and the federal government activating them in their own borders without consulting or working with a state\u2019s governor is effective and dangerous,\u201d the DGA statement said.
