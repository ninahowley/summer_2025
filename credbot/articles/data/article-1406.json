The Valkyrie isn\u2019t just another sports car; it\u2019s the ultimate hypercar, engineered for both the road and the track. With its sleek design and exotic features, it turns heads anywhere it goes. Thanks to its Formula One tech, the Valkyrie comes from a collaboration between the genius Adrian Newey and the talented Aston Martin team. Marek Reichman, Executive Vice President and Chief Creative Officer of Aston Martin, stated: \u201cThe Aston Martin Valkyrie represents a triumph of engineering, design, and aerodynamic innovation \u2014 a true icon born from Aston Martin\u2019s mastery of performance and beauty. Our collaboration with LEGO Technic celebrates the extraordinary engineering and visionary thinking that brought the Valkyrie to life. By integrating it into the Gameloft Asphalt Legends UNITE gaming platform, we\u2019re not only preserving its legacy, but also introducing this remarkable machine to a new audience in a creative way.\u201d This car pushes the limits of what\u2019s possible in automotive design. With radical aerodynamics and jaw-dropping speed, it gives drivers an experience that feels like being behind the wheel of a Formula One racer. It can go from 0 to 62 mph (100 km/h) in just 2.5 seconds and packs a powerful punch with 1,124 horsepower. Inspired by this incredible ride, the LEGO Technic Aston Martin Valkyrie has over 700 pieces that fit together to create a stunning model. Its sleek shape is eye-catching, especially in the iconic Podium Green color. But it\u2019s not just about looks. This set has some cool features, like gullwing doors that actually open, a top-mounted lever for steering, and a detailed V12 engine with moving pistons. It\u2019s all the excitement of Aston Martin packed into one awesome build. Alexandra Dragomir, Marketing Manager for LEGO Technic, said, \u201cWith LEGO Technic and Aston Martin joining forces to create the new LEGO Technic Aston Martin Valkyrie, we\u2019re taking fast-paced play to a whole new level. This latest set highlights the Valkyrie as the pinnacle of engineering, emphasized by the moving functionality of LEGO Technic. We\u2019re excited to bring Aston Martin\u2019s hypercar to life in brick form, as well as through an in-game experience on the Gameloft Asphalt Legends UNITE platform.\u201d The LEGO Technic Aston Martin Valkyrie is more than just a building kit; it\u2019s a celebration of Aston Martin\u2019s exceptional engineering and design. So, if you love cars or LEGO (or both), this is your chance to get creative and build something special. The set is now available at LEGO.com, ready for fans to take home and kick off their adventure in luxury car design and imaginative building for a mere $64.99, which is a whole heck of a lot less than a life-sized Valkyrie\u2019s $4 million price tag.
