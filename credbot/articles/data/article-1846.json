Amid ICC Complaint** WELLINGTON, AOTEAROA NEW ZEALAND | 14 MAY 2025\u2014 In a formal communication submitted to the New Zealand Parliament\u2019s Foreign Affairs division, a coalition of human rights advocates, led byRongo Whakawa, has called for the government to immediately withdraw from the World Health Organization\u2019s Pandemic Treaty and exit the WHO altogether. This demand follows the filing of a formal complaint with theInternational Criminal Court (ICC), accusing New Zealand officials and international partners ofgenocide and crimes against humanity. The complaint is rooted in allegations of grave violations underArticles 6 to 8 bis of the Rome Statute, specifically citing the deployment of biological weapons on New Zealand\u2019s population under the guise of emergency health declarations. The submission argues thatexperimental Covid-19 countermeasures\u2014 distributed during the pandemic \u2014 were falsely promoted as safe and effective but are now alleged to containbiological weapon components, including toxic lipid nanoparticles, plasmid DNA, and SV-40 virus fragments far exceeding permissible safety thresholds. \u201cThere is mounting evidence that these substances, delivered under fraudulent emergency authorisations, may cause long-term genetic harm,\u201d the letter states. \u201cThe New Zealand Government, operating under the corporate entity of the \u2018Crown in right of New Zealand,\u2019 has failed in its duty to protect both the general population and the Indigenous M\u0101ori people.\u201d **WHO Leadership Under Scrutiny** The communication also points to multiple complaints filed with the ICC againstWHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, citing his alleged collusion with organisations implicated in a broader depopulation agenda and global governance takeover. This assertion is reinforced byDr. David Martin\u2019s testimony to the European Parliament, which describes the WHO\u2019s influence as a form of \u201cglobal tyranny,\u201d and echoes Professor Michel Chossudovsky\u2019s analysis of a \u201cglobal coup d\u2019\u00e9tat against humanity.\u201d Links to these statements were provided: Dr. David Martin: WHO Tyranny Testimony Prof. Chossudovsky: Global Coup Analysis **Human Rights Violations and Legal Frameworks** The letter further references violations of key international legal instruments, including: TheUniversal Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights TheNuremberg Code (1946) TheDeclaration of Helsinki (1948) TheInternational Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Article 7 The1989 Biological Weapons Anti-Terrorism Act International human rights lawyerDr. Willem van Aardtis cited as having provided expert opinion on these breaches, asserting that millions of New Zealanders were subjected to coercion, misinformation, and involuntary medical experimentation. His interviews and findings are publicly accessible: Willem van Aardt on Voluntary Consent and Bioweapons **Allegations of HIV Components and Immune Suppression** Further deepening the concern is the discovery ofHIV-related sequenceswithin the genetic makeup of the C-19 vaccine formulations. Independent researchers and platforms, includingChildren\u2019s Health DefenseandAnandamide Substack, report that these genetic inserts could potentially compromise immune system function. Children\u2019s Health Defense: Repeated Vaccines and Immune Harm Anandamide: Fauci HIV Vax Sequence **Call for Accountability and National Sovereignty** The letter concludes by asserting that the New Zealand Government, while operating under thePREP Actand emergency military measures, isno longer able to represent the people of New Zealand in good faith. The authors contend that any treaties signed under current conditions \u2014 including the WHO Pandemic Treaty \u2014 are invalid due to coercion and violation of sovereign rights. \u201cThis is not just a legal issue, it\u2019s a matter of life, dignity, and national survival,\u201d says Rongo Whakawa. \u201cWe urge the government to take immediate action to restore sovereignty, demand accountability, and protect the people from further harm.\u201d **Yes!
