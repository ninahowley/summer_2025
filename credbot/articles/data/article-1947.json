The reason is\u2026 They\u2019re protecting from government overreach. At least, that\u2019s what they say, or that\u2019s how they see their role. And, in fact, that is the classical role of the legal system in the whole formation of a nation-state. There are generally three major institutions used in the formation of a nation: Parliament / Congress Legal System And the Mainstream Media For the most part, congress has been on Trump\u2019s side, and he\u2019s had major control of the mainstream media. He\u2019s barred certain media outlets from the White House Press Room, and he pretty much runs a reality TV show from the Oval Office to his own benefit. But the courts\u2026 The courts are where the buck has been stopping. Generally, the courts would not block the efforts of the President Americans elected, but they are. According to Connor O\u2019Keeffe, \u201cIn May alone, federal courtsruled againstthe Trump administration in 96 percent of the cases brought before them. And while that was a particularly dramatic month, the administration\u2019s loss rate for the entire term so far still stands at a staggering 77 percent. Nearly every one of Trump\u2019s central campaign promises has either been tied up in the courts or blocked entirely by lone federal judges. Everything from the deportation of illegal immigrants, the enactment of tariffs, and the defunding and cutting of federal agencies have come under attack by the federal judiciary.\u201d It seems like Trump\u2019s bulldozing, record-breaking amount of executive orders aren\u2019t dismantling the Deep State the way he\u2019d like to. And as I\u2019ve been talking about, he\u2019s not reducing spending either. In this article, O\u2019Keeffe argues that the courts aren\u2019t for the people. They\u2019re for the preservation and growth of government. Are the courts against the people? Are they responsible for the lack of change, and eventually, the collapse of the West? O\u2019Keeffe implies, \u201cThe courts are our enemy.\u201d Originally posted by Connor O\u2019Keeffe on Mises.org: So far, in his second term, Donald Trump\u2019s biggest headaches haven\u2019t come from the Democrats or his fellow Republicans. Nor have they come from the groups that were his biggest enemies in his first term\u2014the media, federal bureaucrats, or the intelligence agencies. This time around, Trump\u2019s biggest difficulties are coming from the courts. \u201cThe Resistance\u201d has been celebrating the judicial branch as the tip of the spear in the effort to thwart the president\u2019s agenda\u2014and for good reason. In May alone, federal courtsruled againstthe Trump administration in 96 percent of the cases brought before them. And while that was a particularly dramatic month, the administration\u2019s loss rate for the entire term so far still stands at a staggering 77 percent. Nearly every one of Trump\u2019s central campaign promises has either been tied up in the courts or blocked entirely by lone federal judges. Everything from the deportation of illegal immigrants, the enactment of tariffs, and the defunding and cutting of federal agencies have come under attack by the federal judiciary. The battle between the Trump administration and the courts is quickly becoming the defining dynamic of this second Trump term. It may be tempting for opponents of big government to find much of what the federal judiciary is doing commendable. After all, we\u2019re taught in elementary school that the purpose of the judicial branch is to \u201ccheck\u201d the power of the other branches and halt government overreach. But, like a lot of what we were taught about the federal government in school, that simple characterization of the federal judiciary is not accurate. If the purpose of the judicial branch were really to limit the scope of the federal government to the handful of tasks laid out in the Constitution, one would only have to glance at the behemoth in Washington DC\u2014intervening in every aspect of our lives while running a global empire\u2014to conclude that the judicial branch has failed more spectacularly than any other group of watchdogs in history. And yet, the branch continues on as if it\u2019s all working great, which suggests that the federal judiciary is actually serving a different purpose. What might that be? Well, as scholars like Murray Rothbard havepointedoutextensively, there is a much better case to be made that the true purpose of the judicial branch has been the precise opposite of what it claims. That its role has actually been to help the federal government transcend the limits placed on it in the original Constitution. That may sound counterintuitive, but it\u2019s not the first time limits on state power have been turned around and used to help states expand past those limits. As Rothbard explains in Chapter 3 ofFor a New Liberty, the concept of the \u201cdivine right of kings\u201d actually began as a doctrine promoted by the church to limit state power. The idea was that a king could not do anything he wanted because he was constrained by divine law. But as absolutism began to take hold in Europe, kings flipped the concept around to mean that the very fact that they were kings meant their rule represented the will of God. So therefore, anything they did necessarily had God\u2019s approval because otherwise, he wouldn\u2019t have made them kings. Rothbard goes on to explain how parliamentary democracy, utilitarian liberalism, and every other device devised to check state power has eventually come to lose its original purpose and instead, as Bertrand de Jouvenel put it, \u201cto act merely as a springboard to Power.\u201d The same has happened with the federal judiciary and its task to interpret the constitutionality of federal government programs. Because as Rothbardnotes, \u201cIf a judicial decree of \u2018unconstitutional\u2019 is a mighty check on governmental power, so too a verdict of \u2018constitutional\u2019 is an equally mighty weapon for fostering public acceptance of ever greater governmental power.\u201d In other words, while federal courts are defined in the public mind by the few times they have blocked government actions, their more enduring contribution to American history has actually been helping the continuous growth of the federal government by giving it their stamp of legitimacy. One of the major turning points in the judiciary\u2019s transition from a check on power to an enabler of power was the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling on FDR\u2019s New Deal. The Court was hesitant and refused to approve the president\u2019s actions for two whole years\u2014likely because the New Deal programs were so obviously well outside the role of the government as laid out in the Constitution. But then, after some threats from FDR that he would pack the Court, the justices gave their full approval and defined the entire New Deal as presented by Roosevelt as \u201cconstitutional.\u201d The federal government\u2019s enormous and blatantly illegal power grab was, from then on, to be considered entirely legitimate. That dynamic has only accelerated in the decades since, especially as the progressive movement gained prominence. As Roger Pilonput it, while the authors of the Constitution were fairly explicit that any federal government action not directly authorized by the Constitution was forbidden, progressives \u201cturned that on its head\u201d and reasoned that any federal government action not explicitly forbidden in the Constitution is authorized. Today\u2019s federal courts are not basing their rulings on the same text of the Constitution that you can read on the National Archives website. They use what\u2019s called the Constitution Annotated, which is a much longer document containing both the Constitution and annotations with all the previous federal court decisions. Federal court decisions which, like the New Deal ruling, have been increasingly driven by political considerations and the progressive interpretation of the founder\u2019s intent. That is how we get government programs that are obviously well beyond the limits of the original Bill of Rights, like the Federal Reserve, restrictions on firearm ownership, the mass imprisonment of Japanese-Americans, the FBI, the Patriot Act, Obamacare, major undeclared wars, and much, much more. Not in spite of the efforts of the judicial branch, but because of them. That said, there\u2019s some important nuance to consider when analyzing how the established political class, or establishment, has actually gone about expanding its power. They have not tried to expand the federal government as rapidly as possible, nor are they aiming for the federal government to take over every single aspect of American life. If that happened, they wouldn\u2019t get to fully enjoy all the benefits of their ill-gotten profits. It is better to think of the establishment as a coalition of groups that are committed to a specific rate of government growth. It\u2019s a rate that is steady and unyielding during relatively normal times but also fast and ferocious during periods of crisis. There is some dissension\u2014establishment Democrats want the rate of growth to be a bit faster, while establishment Republicans want the rate of growth to slow slightly (never reverse). But overall, that trajectory of government growth, which continues steadily and then ratchets up during crises, is the status quo that the establishment is committed to protecting against anti-establishment forces from all sides of the political spectrum. And that is the status quo that the federal judiciary, which is an integral part of the American political class, is trying to protect against the Trump administration. Because Trump\u2019s attempts to change the status quo in ways that actually benefit the American public for a change have ranged from excellent, like the attempts to cut federal agencies, to terrible, like the raising of import taxes, the rulings from federal courts cannot simply be considered as uniformly good or bad. But it is vitally important to recognize that the establishment judges and justices who make up the federal judiciary are not, in fact, trying to prevent government overreach, as they claim. They are trying to stop Trump from threatening the establishment\u2019s ability to continue pursuing the government overreach they want in a way and at the pace that benefits them. Even if they occasionally rule in ways that opponents of big government may like, it is a mistake to view the judicial branch as an ally. They are anything but. **5 thoughts on \"Connor O\u2019Keeffe: The Federal Judiciary\u2019s War on Trump Is Not About Protecting Us from Government Overreach\"** Harrysays:June 7, 2025 at 10:14 amI agree with this article. Something that was left out has been the perverting of the states representation. At one time individual states decided who would represent them by appointing individual federal senators. Now they are decided by statewide elections which removed the states representation in the federal system and just duplicated the election of the House.In addition, they desparately want to completely gut the 2nd amendment in order to fully implement their Marxist desires but have not been able to. The founders were wise to have included that because they knew the hearts of men are desparately wicked. Something tells me the 2nd amendment will play a major roll in the next iteration of US government.Reply I agree with this article.
