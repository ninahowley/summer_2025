France, 1989 iAt the hospital, Hotel Dieu, Hautfautthe small strips of faded cloth \u2013 patterned in parts,flowers, dots, carefully sewn, hemmed in hope, markthe lives of mothers without choice,in despair. Outsideyou skip, say that your tooth has fallen out,we wrap it carefully. iiIn the Church of Baudefois D\u2019Ansthe priest lines the village children onslim fine wooden benches, wears his beretand Monoprix shoes. Tells them,J\u00e9sus avec l\u2019amour dans son c\u0153ur,his small feet crossed at the ankles. Outsideyou ask whyI didn\u2019t stop the seesaw from hurting you. H\u00f4tel Dieu had a vocation to \u201ccare for poor people.\u201d The hotel / hospital / church has asmall wooden \u201ctower,\u201d a cupboard with a revolving door to make it possible for poor parentsto abandon their children into the care of the religious order under the cover of anonymity.The alternative was to leave the babies to perish on the mountains. Between 1790 and 1847 the revolving door was used 1,947 times. Parents were asked to affixa little cloth ribbon to the infant\u2019s clothes so that, if they had second thoughts within the first24 hours after the abandonment, they could identify and reclaim their child and bringanother part of the fabric with them. These coloured strips were also attached to the baby\u2019sentry in the town\u2019s records. There is no evidence of how many of the babies were reunitedwith their families. It is also not known how many arrived too late to reclaim their babies orlost the tiny piece of fabric. \u25ca Five English Spring Poems for Lee Harwood, 29th March 1984 1. At first the skies are so clearyou would be forgiven thinking\u201csummer oh summer.\u201dbird dart make bidsPicking up all manner of downy silksto line sweet beds. Pushing throughBreaking voluptuous phallic buds.Surprise! O Lupus you haveStolen the purseFrom the rabbitsQuick ear. Dark these woods at night clamour withhooting pheasants, fox wails, waitingsoft muscle to tear open.Look it is here, insidethe poemall of this,all of this,the cat sniffs at the blade of grassthenwalks on.Navy blue evening skies sink down behind thetall English oak trees. 2. In the barnyoung lambsorphaned by morningbleat out. Looking out, smelling for milk, bleat outnuzzling against rock, bleat outwhile others suckle freely never leaving nor left.Watercress streams under sparkling bridges.Nothing relieves the ache of being left. 3. Thin wrists of primrosestartle the mist.Trumpet daffodils battered by 48 hours of rain.All the geese huddle and grumble they just hiss at the wind. 4. Metallic black StarlingSturnes Vulgaris) The glossy purple glintsdip in and outbrown tail feathersbody of white wing feathersroosting in the old English Oak again.Untidy nests, grass, wool, moss, wood shavings from our door. Listening for wormsThe sharp little headsTilt forwardThen sideways again. 5. The wheat is three inches high.St Luke\u2019s little summer has come and goneit is wrought of a sunlight far too light to come from just sun alone.Can it be that which the woods are tangling with,along with the Ivy?Or is it the necklet of tiny stars above us as the wood smokecurls up in tongues?The heart is a repetitious dancer whose feet trip and blunderdespite all this practise.Yet still we sit together while sweet wallflowers are budding in the gardenall of it so young and alone. \u2666 ELAINE RANDELLwas born in 1951 in south London.
