Thesin\u00adgle most com\u00admon out\u00adcomefor a death sen\u00adtence in the mod\u00adern era is for it to be reversed on appeal due to a con\u00adsti\u00adtu\u00adtion\u00adal vio\u00adla\u00adtion. Most peo\u00adple whose sen\u00adtences are reversed get resen\u00adtenced to life in prison or less, but some pros\u00ade\u00adcu\u00adtors per\u00adsist in seek\u00ading new death sen\u00adtences even after mul\u00adti\u00adple rever\u00adsals. A Death Penalty Information Center analy\u00adsis of the14peo\u00adple sen\u00adtenced to death four or more times for the same crime finds that pros\u00ade\u00adcu\u00adto\u00adr\u00adi\u00adal mis\u00adcon\u00adduct, includ\u00ading racial bias, con\u00adtributed to the high num\u00adber of rever\u00adsals. When a court over\u00adturns a death sen\u00adtence due to gov\u00adern\u00adment mis\u00adcon\u00adduct, pros\u00ade\u00adcu\u00adtors are not required to seek death again \u2014 but when they decide to do so, they cre\u00adate new trau\u00adma for vic\u00adtims\u2019 fam\u00adi\u00adly mem\u00adbers and add new costs for tax\u00adpay\u00aders. While this analy\u00adsis focus\u00ades on a small sub\u00adset of death-sen\u00adtenced peo\u00adple, their expe\u00adri\u00adences with pros\u00ade\u00adcu\u00adto\u00adr\u00adi\u00adal mis\u00adcon\u00adduct pro\u00advide insight into the prob\u00adlems that affect many oth\u00ader capital cases. **Pervasive Prosecutorial Misconduct** Curtis Flowers is like\u00adly the most well-known of those with high rever\u00adsal and resen\u00adtenc\u00ading rates, and his case serves as a stark exam\u00adple of pros\u00ade\u00adcu\u00adto\u00adr\u00adi\u00adal mis\u00adcon\u00adduct. Tried six times by the same pros\u00ade\u00adcu\u00adtor and sen\u00adtenced to death four times, Mr. Flowers was exon\u00ader\u00adat\u00aded after the U.S. Supreme Courtover\u00adturnedhis final death sen\u00adtence in2019and the state of Mississippi sub\u00adse\u00adquent\u00adly dropped all charges. The Court grant\u00aded Mr. Flowers relief based on over\u00adwhelm\u00ading evi\u00addence of racial dis\u00adcrim\u00adi\u00adna\u00adtion: across all six tri\u00adals, pros\u00ade\u00adcu\u00adtor Doug Evans used41of42peremp\u00adto\u00adry strikes to exclude Black poten\u00adtial jurors.\u200b\u201cThe num\u00adbers speak loud\u00adly,\u201d Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote for the sev\u00aden-jus\u00adtice major\u00adi\u00adty.\u200b\u201cThe State\u2019s relent\u00adless, deter\u00admined effort to rid the jury of black indi\u00advid\u00adu\u00adals strong\u00adly sug\u00adgests that the State want\u00aded to try Flowers before a jury with as few black jurors as pos\u00adsi\u00adble, and ide\u00adal\u00adly before an all-white jury.\u201d Mr. Flowers\u2019 first two con\u00advic\u00adtions were over\u00adturned due to mis\u00adcon\u00adduct in how the state pre\u00adsent\u00aded evi\u00addence, ques\u00adtioned wit\u00adness\u00ades, and argued to the jury. The Mississippi Supreme Courtfoundthe state\u2019s actions in the first tri\u00adal to be\u200b\u201cegre\u00adgious,\u201d\u200b\u201cbad faith,\u201d and\u200b\u201chigh\u00adly prej\u00adu\u00addi\u00adcial,\u201d thenheldthat the state\u200b\u201cemployed many of the same tac\u00adtics\u201d dur\u00ading the sec\u00adond tri\u00adal. Mr. Flowers\u2019 third con\u00advic\u00adtion was over\u00adturned by the Mississippi Supreme Court because Mr. Evans used all15of the state\u2019s peremp\u00adto\u00adry strikes against Black poten\u00adtial jurors in vio\u00adla\u00adtion ofBatson v. Kentucky(1986), whichbars racial dis\u00adcrim\u00adi\u00adna\u00adtion in jury selec\u00adtion. That court held that Mr. Evans\u2019 behav\u00adior rep\u00adre\u00adsent\u00aded\u200b\u201cas strong a\u2026case of racial dis\u00adcrim\u00adi\u00adna\u00adtion as we have ever seen in the con\u00adtext of aBatsonchal\u00adlenge.\u201d Mr. Flowers\u2019 fourth and fifth tri\u00adals end\u00aded with hung juries. Curtis Flowers after his ankle mon\u00adi\u00adtor was removed. In revers\u00ading Mr. Flowers\u2019 sixth and final con\u00advic\u00adtion and death sen\u00adtence, the U.S. Supreme Court wrote that the\u200b\u201cState appeared to pro\u00adceed as ifBatsonhad nev\u00ader been decid\u00aded.\u201d Beyond the\u200b\u201cbla\u00adtant pat\u00adtern\u201d in the race of exclud\u00aded jurors, the Court also point\u00aded to\u200b\u201cdra\u00admat\u00adi\u00adcal\u00adly dis\u00adparate ques\u00adtion\u00ading of black and white prospec\u00adtive jurors,\u201d\u200b\u201cfac\u00adtu\u00adal\u00adly inac\u00adcu\u00adrate state\u00adments about black prospec\u00adtive jurors,\u201d and sim\u00adi\u00adlar\u00adi\u00adties between struck Black jurors and retained white jurors as key indi\u00adca\u00adtors of Mr. Evans\u2019 dis\u00adcrim\u00adi\u00adna\u00adtion. Mr. Flowers received Mississippi\u2019s max\u00adi\u00admum com\u00adpen\u00adsa\u00adtion of $500,000for his22years of wrong\u00adful incar\u00adcer\u00ada\u00adtion on death row. Prosecutors also com\u00admit mis\u00adcon\u00adduct when they with\u00adhold evi\u00addence favor\u00adable to the defense or present evi\u00addence they know to be false. During Lacey Mark Sivak\u2019s fourth cap\u00adi\u00adtal tri\u00adal in Idaho for the mur\u00adder of a gas sta\u00adtion atten\u00addant dur\u00ading a rob\u00adbery, the pros\u00ade\u00adcu\u00adtion called two jail\u00adhouse infor\u00admants who claimed that Mr. Sivak had con\u00adfessed to the mur\u00adder. While Mr. Sivak admit\u00adted to par\u00adtic\u00adi\u00adpat\u00ading in the rob\u00adbery, he argued that his code\u00adfen\u00addant shot and sex\u00adu\u00adal\u00adly assault\u00aded the vic\u00adtim. Both infor\u00admants claimed on the stand that they had not received any favors from the pros\u00ade\u00adcu\u00adtion for their tes\u00adti\u00admo\u00adny, but let\u00adters dis\u00adcov\u00adered by the defense years lat\u00ader revealed that the pros\u00ade\u00adcu\u00adtion had helped get charges dropped in two states for one of the infor\u00admants and writ\u00adten to the parole board to rec\u00adom\u00admend his release. The oth\u00ader infor\u00admant wrote to his sen\u00adtenc\u00ading judge that he had been\u200b\u201cpromised deals by the pros\u00ade\u00adcut\u00ading attorney\u2019s office,\u201d admit\u00adted that he was\u200b\u201ca chron\u00adic liar,\u201d and said that\u200b\u201clying was a way of life\u201d for him. The Ninth Circuit held in2011that the state had vio\u00adlat\u00aded Mr. Sivak\u2019s con\u00adsti\u00adtu\u00adtion\u00adal rights. The\u200b\u201conly direct evi\u00addence of Sivak\u2019s per\u00adson\u00adal par\u00adtic\u00adi\u00adpa\u00adtion in the crime\u201d came from the two infor\u00admants and his code\u00adfen\u00addant, the Ninth Circuit held, and because all three wit\u00adness\u00ades were\u200b\u201cinher\u00adent\u00adly unre\u00adli\u00adable,\u201d there was a rea\u00adson\u00adable like\u00adli\u00adhood that the out\u00adcome would have been dif\u00adfer\u00adent if the state had not sub\u00adorned wit\u00adness per\u00adjury. Mr. Sivak\u2019s three pre\u00advi\u00adous death sen\u00adtences were over\u00adturned based on errors by the tri\u00adal judge, includ\u00ading fail\u00ading to read his find\u00adings to Mr. Sivak in open court, refus\u00ading to con\u00adsid\u00ader new mit\u00adi\u00adga\u00adtion evi\u00addence, and improp\u00ader\u00adly con\u00adsid\u00ader\u00ading vic\u00adtim impact evi\u00addence. Mr. Sivak was resen\u00adtenced to life with\u00adout parole in2013based on an agree\u00adment with pros\u00ade\u00adcu\u00adtors, who told press that\u200b\u201cwe\u2019re sat\u00adis\u00adfied that this is the right thing under the cir\u00adcum\u00adstances\u201d and not\u00aded that the victim\u2019s fam\u00adi\u00adly sup\u00adport\u00aded a life sentence. Another type of pros\u00ade\u00adcu\u00adto\u00adr\u00adi\u00adal mis\u00adcon\u00adduct involves mak\u00ading improp\u00ader argu\u00adments to the jury, such as com\u00adments that unfair\u00adly char\u00adac\u00adter\u00adize the defen\u00addant or bol\u00adster the strength of the prosecution\u2019s evi\u00addence. Such was the case for Phillip Tomlin, who was sen\u00adtenced to death by an Alabama judge four times despite the fact that every jury that heard his case unan\u00adi\u00admous\u00adly rec\u00adom\u00admend\u00aded a life sen\u00adtence.1Courts over\u00adturned three of Mr. Tomlin\u2019s death sen\u00adtences due to pros\u00ade\u00adcu\u00adto\u00adr\u00adi\u00adal or juror mis\u00adcon\u00adduct, and the fourth based on the judge\u2019s mis\u00aduse of the over\u00adride func\u00adtion, before Mr. Tomlin was final\u00adlyresen\u00adtencedto life with\u00adout parole in2004. During clos\u00ading argu\u00adments of Mr. Tomlin\u2019s first tri\u00adal, the pros\u00ade\u00adcu\u00adtor implied that the tri\u00adal judge agreed with the prosecution\u2019s evi\u00addence, then sug\u00adgest\u00aded that Mr. Tomlin\u2019s wife\u2019s deci\u00adsion not to tes\u00adti\u00adfy was sus\u00adpi\u00adcious. The Alabama Court of Criminal Appealsheldthat the prosecutor\u2019s com\u00adments\u200b\u201cseri\u00adous\u00adly affect\u00aded the fair\u00adness and integri\u00adty of the judi\u00adcial pro\u00adceed\u00adings.\u201d The same courtover\u00adturnedMr. Tomlin\u2019s sec\u00adond con\u00advic\u00adtion because the state again com\u00admit\u00adted mis\u00adcon\u00adduct, this time when the pros\u00ade\u00adcu\u00adtor elicit\u00aded tes\u00adti\u00admo\u00adny that Mr. Tomlin\u2019s code\u00adfen\u00addant had been sent to death row for the mur\u00adders, then improp\u00ader\u00adly com\u00adment\u00aded on Mr. Tomlin\u2019s deci\u00adsion not to tes\u00adti\u00adfy. The court also iden\u00adti\u00adfied sev\u00ader\u00adal errors by the tri\u00adal judge, includ\u00ading mis\u00adstat\u00ading the stan\u00addard for first-degree mur\u00adder dur\u00ading jury instruc\u00adtions. And in1996, the Alabama Court of Criminal AppealsreversedMr. Tomlin\u2019s third con\u00advic\u00adtion and death sen\u00adtence because a juror did not reveal key facts about him\u00adself dur\u00ading jury selec\u00adtion, includ\u00ading his crim\u00adi\u00adnal record, his own expe\u00adri\u00adences as a crime vic\u00adtim, and his knowl\u00adedge of the case. The court found that the juror had a\u200b\u201ctotal dis\u00adre\u00adgard for truth\u00adful dis\u00adclo\u00adsure\u201d and the prin\u00adci\u00adples of jury service. Though Mr. Tomlin even\u00adtu\u00adal\u00adly won relief, Jerry Jerome Smith remains on death row in Alabama as one of only two peo\u00adple sen\u00adtenced to death five times for the same crime in the mod\u00adern era.2Mr. Smith\u2019s first four death sen\u00adtences were over\u00adturned due to con\u00adsti\u00adtu\u00adtion\u00adal errors by the jury and judge, but the Equal Justice Initiative has also point\u00aded to evi\u00addence of pros\u00ade\u00adcu\u00adto\u00adr\u00adi\u00adal mis\u00adcon\u00adduct across mul\u00adti\u00adple of Mr. Smith\u2019s tri\u00adals.

Factors con\u00adtribut\u00ading to high\u00ader costs in cap\u00adi\u00adtal cas\u00adesincludea larg\u00ader, unique\u00adly qual\u00adi\u00adfied legal defense team; more com\u00adplex pre\u00adtri\u00adal pro\u00adce\u00addures, tri\u00adals, and appeals; addi\u00adtion\u00adal secu\u00adri\u00adty and staff dur\u00ading tri\u00adal and incar\u00adcer\u00ada\u00adtion; and expen\u00adsive drugs and mate\u00adri\u00adals for exe\u00adcu\u00adtion. These costs are com\u00adpound\u00aded when pros\u00ade\u00adcu\u00adtors decide to pur\u00adsue anoth\u00ader death sen\u00adtence even after their own mis\u00adcon\u00adduct has result\u00aded in an order for a new tri\u00adal. Nine of the14indi\u00advid\u00adu\u00adals (64%) stud\u00adied here have been per\u00adma\u00adnent\u00adly removed from death row because they were resen\u00adtenced to life, had their sen\u00adtences com\u00admut\u00aded, or in the case of Mr. Flowers, were exon\u00ader\u00adat\u00aded. These nine peo\u00adple col\u00adlec\u00adtive\u00adly had at least43cap\u00adi\u00adtal tri\u00adals or sen\u00adtenc\u00ading pro\u00adceed\u00adings fund\u00aded by tax\u00adpay\u00aders, only for juries, courts, or pros\u00ade\u00adcu\u00adtors to ulti\u00admate\u00adly deter\u00admine that life in prison was the appro\u00adpri\u00adate sen\u00adtence.3 It is a sim\u00adple fact that seek\u00ading the death penal\u00adty is more expen\u00adsive. There is not one cred\u00adi\u00adble study, to our knowl\u00adedge, that presents evi\u00addence to the contrary. An Analysis of the Economic Costs of Capital Punishment in Oklahoma, Prepared for the Oklahoma Death Penalty Review Commission,2017 Richard Jordan is sched\u00aduled to die in Mississippi on June25on the basis of his fourth death sen\u00adtence \u2014 even though the state pre\u00advi\u00adous\u00adly agreed that his crimedid not mer\u00adit the death penal\u00adty. When a courtheldthat Mr. Jordan\u2019s third death sen\u00adtence was unlaw\u00adful because the tri\u00adal judge had improp\u00ader\u00adly exclud\u00aded mit\u00adi\u00adgat\u00ading evi\u00addence regard\u00ading his good behav\u00adior in prison, the state offered him a plea deal and he was resen\u00adtenced to life in1991. As part of the agree\u00adment, pros\u00ade\u00adcu\u00adtors acknowl\u00adedged mit\u00adi\u00adgat\u00ading cir\u00adcum\u00adstances includ\u00ading Mr. Jordan\u2019s\u200b\u201cremorse, his record of hon\u00ador\u00adable ser\u00advice and dis\u00adabil\u00adi\u00adty incurred in the mil\u00adi\u00adtary dur\u00ading the Vietnam War, his good behav\u00adior in prison, and his sig\u00adnif\u00adi\u00adcant con\u00adtri\u00adbu\u00adtions to soci\u00adety while incar\u00adcer\u00adat\u00aded.\u201d4But when that life sen\u00adtence was inval\u00adi\u00addat\u00aded in court for pro\u00adce\u00addur\u00adal rea\u00adsons, the pros\u00ade\u00adcu\u00adtors reneged on their promise and suc\u00adcess\u00adful\u00adly secured a fourth death sentence. Three Supreme Court jus\u00adticesdis\u00adsent\u00adedfrom the denial of review of Mr. Jordan\u2019s appeal in2015, with Justice Sonia Sotomayor writ\u00ading that Mr. Jordan should have been able to present evi\u00addence to a low\u00ader court\u200b\u201cthat the prosecutor\u2019s deci\u00adsion to seek the death penal\u00adty after hav\u00ading agreed to a less\u00ader sen\u00adtence was uncon\u00adsti\u00adtu\u00adtion\u00adal\u00adly vin\u00addic\u00adtive.\u201d Justice Stephen Breyer also dis\u00adsent\u00aded from denial of review in Mr. Jordan\u2019s case in2018, high\u00adlight\u00ading Mr. Jordan\u2019s four-plus decades of incar\u00adcer\u00ada\u00adtion and the\u200b\u201cgeo\u00adgraph\u00adic arbi\u00adtrari\u00adness\u201d of his death sen\u00adtence as rea\u00adsons Justice Breyer believed the death penal\u00adty to be categorically unconstitutional. If Mr. Jordan\u2019s exe\u00adcu\u00adtion pro\u00adceeds, he will become the first per\u00adson exe\u00adcut\u00aded in the mod\u00adern era whose death sen\u00adtence was over\u00adturned three times due to con\u00adsti\u00adtu\u00adtion\u00adal errors. He will be the fourth known mil\u00adi\u00adtary vet\u00ader\u00adan put to death this year,5and at age79, the third-old\u00adest per\u00adson exe\u00adcut\u00aded in the mod\u00adern era.6His exe\u00adcu\u00adtion is sched\u00aduled to take place49years after he was first sen\u00adtenced to death. **Individuals Sentenced to Death Four or More Times for Same Crime** SeeDPI\u2019sDeath Penalty Censusfor more infor\u00adma\u00adtion about each indi\u00advid\u00adual and their death sentences.
