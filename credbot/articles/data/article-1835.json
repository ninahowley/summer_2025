In fact, this fog seemed to cover half the US, especially the southeast. In Naples, Florida, a man there who experienced this fog also happened to run a laboratory. So he tested fog samples. He was curious because people were reporting that the fog had a strange chemical smell and people were having respiratory issues. The fog wasn\u2019t really wet like it normally would be. Ring camera footage looked like massive swarms of insects rather than the typical rain or snow you\u2019d expect to see. And it went on for days, so he was curious. You\u2019ll never believe what he found. Bacteria, and lots of it, specificallySerratia marcescens, a bacteria that is typically a hospital-acquired bacterial infection. It tends to infect people who are already immune compromised, which would explain the reports of many people suddenly developing respiratory infections all at once. Don\u2019t believe it? Read Dr. Jen Brown\u2019ssubstack, complete with the lab results. It seems a precedent has been set with this bacteria, because our government used this bacteria before in biological warfare experiments on the GENERAL POPULATION. In 1950, the DoD releasedSerratia marcescensbacteria over San Francisco to determine \u201chow far the material would disperse and how much of it would be living at the end of the journey.\u201d How nice. And according to our Tenpenny Report guest authorJon Fleetwood, this secret experiment wasn\u2019t disclosed until 1977. It\u2019s chilling. But it\u2019s a good reminder too. The Deep State efforts tostarve usand make us sick have been going on a long time.
