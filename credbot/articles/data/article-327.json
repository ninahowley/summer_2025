He said Air Peace prevented him and other passengers from boarding from Lagos to Abuja despite doing online check-in. Oshiomhole accused an Air Peace official of selling air tickets on the spot at inflated prices to willing buyers. He made this clarification known in an interview with Vanguard. This comes as Air Peace, in a statement on Wednesday, alleged thatOshiomhole clashed with its staff and disrupted flight operationbecause the senator missed his flight. However, Senator Oshiomhole, who was the former Nigeria Labour Congress president, gave a contrary view, noting that it was a case of Air Peace frustrating passengers, including him. \u201cI booked Air Peace\u2026 They delayed the flight for over five hours. In the end, they announced a cancellation. I had to get another ticket. \u201cYesterday, I booked a flight for 6:30 a.m., which is their first flight today. I booked and asked them to check me in online, which I did, along with two other Ghanaians who met me in Lagos. \u201cWe checked in online just to avoid the last-minute issues I\u2019ve had with them a couple of times. \u201cI got there at about five minutes past six. They told me the counter was closed. I told them, \u2018No, I\u2019ve already checked in.\u2019 I showed them the evidence of my online check-in. Even before then, they had asked if I had checked in, and I told them yes and that I had no luggage. \u201cThey looked at it but still said the gate had been closed. Meanwhile, I noticed they were still taking other people in. \u201cSo I asked, \u2018How can you close boarding for a 6:30 flight at 6:05? What is the purpose of online check-in, then?\u2019 If I had to go through another check-in process, then what\u2019s the point of checking in online? \u201cWhile speaking to them, I saw many men and women who had been there even before me, with similar experiences. Basically, they were selling tickets on the spot at higher prices. I\u2019ll give you an example. A lady bought her ticket for N146,000 online. She arrived at the airport at 5:55 a.m. for the 6:30 a.m. flight, after the gatemen had delayed her. \u201cThey told her she was late and that the counter had closed for check-in. She said that was impossible, as it wasn\u2019t even 6:00 a.m. They told her she would be put on the next flight. She protested, saying, \u2018Why? Put me on this flight.\u2019 But they told her the flight was full and she would have to wait. \u201cMeanwhile, the airline was selling tickets on the spot for between N200,000 and N300,000. To take advantage of the situation, they discouraged those who had bought tickets online at lower rates and sold to people willing to pay more. \u201cI asked the manager, \u2018What is this woman\u2019s crime? She has a baby that\u2019s no more than six months old. How can you refuse to board her when the aircraft is still on the ground and more people are buying tickets?\u2019 You cannot continue like this. Tomorrow, everyone will blame the government. You have regulatory agencies, and they are all compromising. You cannot board people buying tickets on the spot and deny those who booked days ago or checked in online. \u201cBy the time the DSS and Air Force personnel came to find out what happened, they intervened and offered to put the woman on the next flight\u2014the same offer they had made to me earlier. But to board that next flight, they told her she would have to pay N109,100. This was in addition to the original N146,000 ticket, meaning she would spend about N256,000 for a one-hour flight to Abuja. There were many others in the same situation, and everyone was shouting at the airport. \u201cI said to the manager, \u2018You must follow the rules.\u2019 Many people were stranded, except those who could afford another ticket. I followed the woman to the counter and told her to do whatever they asked. Those of us who were also prevented from flying gathered there. Even when an officer offered me access to a lounge, people around said, \u2018Comrade, please don\u2019t leave\u2014this is how they\u2019ve been treating us.\u2019 \u201cI had to send that woman N500,000. That\u2019s basically what happened. I told them this cannot be allowed. I checked in online and arrived on time. The aircraft hadn\u2019t taken off. I\u2019m not supposed to check in twice. The rowdiness arose because many people were denied boarding while ickets were being sold on the spot to others\u201d, he stated.
