It Still Needs You to Make It Work Software & Apps> Windows> **The First 5 Things You Should Do With Your New Computer** Important first steps include installing available updates and a file recovery program Emporia State University Update Antimalware Install Windows Updates Set Up File Recovery Set Up Online Backups Uninstall Unwanted Programs Frequently Asked Questions As compelling as it is to jump right into using your new computer, there are a few things you need to do first when setting it up. No matter if it's a snazzy new Microsoft Surface Book, some otherWindows 11laptop, or a traditional desktop computer...don't worry about your computer skills or where specific keyboard keys are. Instead, here are five things to address before you do anything else: Have a laptop or tablet instead? Yourfirst steps look a little different. **Update Your Antimalware Program** The last thing you want to do is get your new computer infected with malware. Who wants that? We considered calling this \"install anantimalware program\" but almost all computers come with one preinstalled. Windows has Microsoft's own built-in tool, so most PCs are ready to go. Here's the thing, though: It won't be updated. Probably not, anyway. So, after setting it up, head to the scanner's settings and update the \"definitions\"\u2014the instructions that teach the program how to identify and remove new viruses, Trojans, worms, etc. As mentioned above, new Windows computers typically have basic antivirus protection, but it's not the best. There are plenty ofantivirus programs for Windowsthat you can get for free; you can alsoremove viruses on your Mac. **Install Available Windows Updates** Yes, you'd think yourbrand-newcomputer would be fully updated, but chances are it won't be. Microsoft releases security and non-security updates to Windows on at least a monthly basis, oftentimes more frequently than that! SeeHow to Install Windows Updatesif you've never done this and need help. TheWindows Updatetool is preconfigured to download and install updates automatically. While this is generally a good thing, it can be a bit overwhelming of a thing to happen in the background during the first few hours of using your new computer. Fortunately, it's easy tochange Windows Update settings\u2014this is something we usually recommend people do. Windows Update might installdriverupdates for you, too, which are needed for yourhardwareto work properly. However, Microsoft only provides basic drivers forsomehardware, and will not install a driver for some gaming mice,USBmicrophones, and other devices you might plug into your new computer, like a webcam, drawing tablet, etc. Fortunately, there are several options when it comes to using afree driver updater tool, which is a program that can check for missing or outdated drivers and, oftentimes, download and install them for you, sometimes even automatically. Keep one of those programs on your computer to make sure you always have quick access to these updates. They're especially helpful if yournetwork adapterdoesn't work and you need a network driver but don't have an internet connection. This might be a scenario if you'veinstalled Windows manually. **Install a File Recovery Program** This one might surprise you. Why install a program to helprecover accidentally deleted filesif you haven't even used your computer yet, let alone lost something? Here's why: The big catch-22 about file recovery programs is that you're better off installing one before you actually need it. Waiting until the file has been deleted to install the program, might overwrite that same space on thehard drivewhere your deleted file is sitting, preventing you from undeleting it. That's not a risk you want to take. See ourFree File Recovery Software Programslist for a number of excellent and completely free undelete tools. Just install one and forget it. If you need it in the future, it'll be there. **Sign Up for an Online Backup Service** Yep, another proactive step here, one you'll be thanking us for someday. Online backup services are combination software tools and subscription services that automatically keep what data you want to be protected on secure servers away from your home or business. Anonline backup serviceis the best and most cost-effective long term solution to keeping your data safe. The better-rated ones in our list are inexpensive, let you back up as much as you want, and are really easy to download and install. However, if buying a new computer is the last big purchase you want to make for a while, consider using afree backup serviceor, at the very least, alocal backup tool. **Uninstall Programs You Don't Want** You may already have noticed that your computer came with a lot of...well, let's just say \"extra\" software. In theory, leaving these programs installed won't hurt much if anything, aside from taking up a bit of hard drive space. In reality, many of these preinstalled programs run in the background, hogging upmemoryandprocessorpower that you'd rather use for other things. Our advice? Head into Settings ofControl Panel, depending on your Windows version, anduninstall those programs. An easier option, if you'd like, is to use a dedicated uninstaller program for just this purpose. They're calleduninstallers, andwe've reviewed a number of them. **FAQ** How do I transfer files to a new computer?If you're replacing an older computer, the two easiest ways to move files between them are via backups or with an external drive. For example, you can restore a new Mac from aTime Machine backupof the old one; PCs have the similarFile History feature.

How do I move software licenses to a new computer?Generally, you'll install the software on your new Mac or PC, and then sign in with your credentials.
