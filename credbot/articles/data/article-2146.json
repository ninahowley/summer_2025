The jury's operations are a bit peculiar** Harvey Weinsteinwasfound guilty, but there was a catch. After five days of deliberations in theraperetrial, thejuryreturned a guilty verdict on one of the three counts with a second receiving an acquittal. However, the third count, which is an accusation from Jessica Mann, was left undecided as Judge Curtis Farber instructed the jury to return tomorrow for further consideration. Criminal defense attorneyEric Faddis, founding partner of Colorado-basedVarner Faddis, told the Mirror US, \u201cTheentire deliberations process has been extraordinaryin this case. It\u2019s kind of bizarre that the court was willing to accept this partial verdict and ask jurors to go back and continue deliberating on the third count. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen that.\" Before a decision even hit the courtroom, there appeared to be trouble brewing. Previously,a juror came forward to Judge Curtis Farber, asking to be dismissed. They cited in-fighting among jury members, who allegedly were caught gossiping in elevators. \u201cThe experience I\u2019ve had in the day-and-a-half here, in good conscience, I don\u2019t think this is fair and just,\u201d he said. Ultimately, the judge reminded the juror, who described the issues as \"playground stuff,\" of his duty and stressed that the trial would fall about if he was let go. Similarly, the foreperson came forward with concerns about the jury deliberations. He asked to speak privately with the judge about issues in the conversations. The foreperson then asked the judge to speak \u201cabout a situation that isn\u2019t very good,\" including \"something going on in the jury room.\" The conversation occurred behind closed doors with the judge, foreperson, and attorneys.Weinsteindeclined to participate. Additional details about the issue weren't immediately made available to the public. The jury drama bled into the morning of Wednesday when the foreperson was further questioned in private about what was happening. \u201cHe said words to the effect of \u2018I can\u2019t go back in there with the other jurors,\u2019\u201d the judge later said. The foreperson was then sent to a separate room. Faddis wagered that the judge was motivated to wrap the trial quickly, especially as it is a retrial on the issue. \"This is a highly publicized case that the world is following, and the first trial ended in a reversal and everyone had to go back to the drawing board. So it seems like the court was seeking some finality in this case of high public importance rather than allowing another mistrial,\" he said. The possibility of a mistrial hasn't yet been ruled out, either. In a situation where a jury is deadlocked after a few days, they'd typically call is a mistrial. However, as a retrial would mark a third go at court in New York, the judge sent them back to consider longer. It's not an easy fix. Faddis explained, \"There's a risk the jurors could be coerced into reaching a conclusion they don't want to reach, in part because they simply want to be done with the trial. And by requiring the jury to keep deliberating, it could cause an appellate court to determine the judge erred in that decision and could cause yet another reversal. \u201cA mistrial could still be declared on that remaining count \u2014 it remains to be seen.\u201d **Sign up to our FREE newsletter and get the top stories to your inbox** DAILY NEWSLETTER:Sign up hereto get the latest news and updates from the Mirror US straight to your inbox with our FREE newsletter.
