We consider study protocols for proposed or ongoing prospective clinical research that provide a detailed account of the hypothesis, rationale and methodology of the study, and the associated ethical requirements. By publishing your protocol with us, it becomes a fully citable open-access article. We evaluate study protocol submissions on a case-by-case basis and consider only those for proposed or ongoing studies that have not completed participant recruitment at the time of submission. We encourage authors to submit their study protocols well in advance of participant recruitment completion and confirm the study status within the cover letter. Study protocols for pilot or feasibility studies are not considered, and authors are encouraged to submit the pilot results as a research article and the study protocol for the definitive study. Additionally, we may not consider study protocols where authors have other articles published or under consideration relating to the same protocol. Please note that study protocols for systematic reviews are not considered by the BMC Series journals. If a proposed study protocol has obtained formal ethical approval and undergone independent peer-review from a major funding body, it will usually be considered for publication without further peer-review. Please ensure the Declarations section in your manuscript outlines the funding information, including whether it was peer reviewed and information about ethical approval. In some cases, the Editor may request to see the peer-review reports from the funder and/or may send the protocol for additional peer review. Please note that study protocols without major external funding or ethics approval may not be considered for publication. Protocols of randomized controlled trials should follow theSPIRITguidelines and must have a trial registration number included in the last line of the abstract, as described in our editorial policies. Please provide a completed SPIRIT checklist as a supplementary file when submitting your protocol. When conducting peer-review of study protocols, the intention is not to change the study design. Instead, we ask our reviewers to evaluate and report on the study's adequacy in testing the hypothesis, whether there is sufficient detail for replication or comparison, the appropriateness of the planned statistical analysis, and the acceptability of the writing. The final decision on whether to consider a study protocol for publication will rest with the Editor, and appeals will not be considered. To ensure a smooth submission process, please take note of the following before submitting: Confirm the status of your study within the cover letter. Ensure that the Declarations section is complete and contains ethical approval and funding information. For protocols describing clinical trials, provide a completed copy of theSPIRIT checklistas a supplementary file. Professionally produced Visual Abstracts BMC Cancerwill consider visual abstracts.

Please minimize the use of abbreviations and do not cite references in the abstract. The abstract must include the following separate sections: Background:the context and purpose of the study Methods:how the study will be performed Discussion:a brief summary and potential implications Trial registration:If your article reports the results of a health care intervention on human participants, it must be registered in an appropriate registry and the registration number and date of registration should be in stated in this section. If it was not registered prospectively (before enrollment of the first participant), you should include the words 'retrospectively registered'. See our editorial policies for more information on trial registration **Keywords** Three to ten keywords representing the main content of the article. **Background** The Background section should explain the background to the study, its aims, a summary of the existing literature and why this study is necessary or its contribution to the field. **Methods/Design** The methods section should include: the aim, design and setting of the study the characteristics of participants or description of materials a clear description of all processes, interventions and comparisons.

See oureditorial policiesfor more information. If your manuscript does not report on or involve the use of any animal or human data or tissue, please state \u201cNot applicable\u201d in this section. If your manuscript contains any individual person\u2019s data in any form (including any individual details, images or videos), consent for publication must be obtained from that person, or in the case of children, their parent or legal guardian. All presentations of case reports must have consent for publication. You can use your institutional consent form or ourconsent formif you prefer. You should not send the form to us on submission, but we may request to see a copy at any stage (including after publication).

All manuscripts must include an \u2018Availability of data and materials\u2019 statement. Data availability statements should include information on where data supporting the results reported in the article can be found including, where applicable, hyperlinks to publicly archived datasets analysed or generated during the study. By data we mean the minimal dataset that would be necessary to interpret, replicate and build upon the findings reported in the article. We recognise it is not always possible to share research data publicly, for instance when individual privacy could be compromised, and in such instances data availability should still be stated in the manuscript along with any conditions for access. Authors are also encouraged to preserve search strings on searchRxivhttps://searchrxiv.org/, an archive to support researchers to report, store and share their searches consistently and to enable them to review and re-use existing searches. searchRxiv enables researchers to obtain a digital object identifier (DOI) for their search, allowing it to be cited. Data availability statements can take one of the following forms (or a combination of more than one if required for multiple datasets): The datasets generated and/or analysed during the current study are available in the [NAME] repository, [PERSISTENT WEB LINK TO DATASETS] The datasets used and/or analysed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request. All data generated or analysed during this study are included in this published article [and its supplementary information files]. The datasets generated and/or analysed during the current study are not publicly available due [REASON WHY DATA ARE NOT PUBLIC] but are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request. Data sharing is not applicable to this article as no datasets were generated or analysed during the current study. The data that support the findings of this study are available from [third party name] but restrictions apply to the availability of these data, which were used under license for the current study, and so are not publicly available. Data are however available from the authors upon reasonable request and with permission of [third party name]. Not applicable. If your manuscript does not contain any data, please state 'Not applicable' in this section. More examples of template data availability statements, which include examples of openly available and restricted access datasets, are availablehere. BioMed Central strongly encourages the citation of any publicly available data on which the conclusions of the paper rely in the manuscript. Data citations should include a persistent identifier (such as a DOI) and should ideally be included in the reference list. Citations of datasets, when they appear in the reference list, should include the minimum information recommended by DataCite and follow journal style. Dataset identifiers including DOIs should be expressed as full URLs. For example: Hao Z, AghaKouchak A, Nakhjiri N, Farahmand A. Global integrated drought monitoring and prediction system (GIDMaPS) data sets. figshare. 2014.http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.853801 With the corresponding text in the Availability of data and materials statement: The datasets generated during and/or analysed during the current study are available in the [NAME] repository, [PERSISTENT WEB LINK TO DATASETS].[Reference number] If you wish to co-submit a data note describing your data to be published inBMC Research Notes, you can do so by visiting oursubmission portal.
