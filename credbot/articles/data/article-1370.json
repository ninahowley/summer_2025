This discovery pushes the limits of observational astronomy and cracks open one of the most mysterious epochs in cosmic history. The breakthrough, led by a team of Johns Hopkins University astronomers and reported in theAstrophysical Journal, marks the first time Earth-based telescopes isolated these elusive signals from the reionization era, an early phase of the universe when the first stars and galaxies lit up the cosmos. \u201cPeople thought this couldn\u2019t be done from the ground,\u201d project leader and Johns Hopkins professor of physics and astronomy, Dr. Tobias Marriage, said in arelease. \u201cAstronomy is a technology-limited field, and microwave signals from the Cosmic Dawn are famously difficult to measure.\u201d \u201cGround-based observations face additional challenges compared to space,\u201d Marriage added. \u201cOvercoming those obstacles makes this measurement a significant achievement.\u201d **Peering Over 13 Billion Years Back in Time** Most scientists place the dawn of the universe sometime around 13.8 billion years before the present. After the initial formation event, the Big Bang, the universe was filled with dense electrons that even prevented light from escaping. After the universe began to cool, microwave light was ultimately able to escape and fill the space in between. According to the Johns Hopkins-led research team, the formation of new stars during this Cosmic Dawn accelerated the process, causing the microwave light to scatter or polarize. \u201cWhen light hits the hood of your car and you see a glare, that\u2019s polarization,\u201d explained the study\u2019s first author, Yunyang Li, a PhD student at Johns Hopkins and then a fellow at the University of Chicago during the research. Still, detecting the polarized light fromthe cosmic dawn over 13 million years agois particularly difficult, especially for Earth-based telescopes. According to Marriage, ground-based observations \u201cface additional challenges\u201d compared to space observatories. For example, telescopes operating within the Earth\u2019s atmosphere must differentiate cosmic data from broadcast radio waves, radar, and satellite signals. Weather, temperature, and atmosphere also pose challenges that make observations of this sensitivity difficult even in perfect conditions. **Cosmic Dawn: A Look 13 Billion Years Back in Time** In their new study, the researchers say they were curious to see if they could look back over 13 billion years to the Cosmic Dawn using the telescopes in the U.S. National Science Foundation\u2019s Cosmology Large Angular Scale Surveyor, or CLASS, project. CLASS\u2014short for Cosmology Large Angular Scale Surveyor\u2014is an ambitious multi-telescope project funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation and operated from the Parque Astron\u00f3mico Atacama in northern Chile. Positioned at a high elevation to minimize atmospheric distortion, the telescopes are uniquely engineered to capture polarizationin the cosmic microwave background (CMB)\u2014the residualglow from the Big Bang\u2014at enormous angular scales. At the heart of this endeavor lies the challenge of detecting \u201cE-mode\u201d polarization patterns in the CMB caused by free electrons liberated when the first stars ionized the surrounding hydrogen gas. That scattering leaves a barely perceptible fingerprint in the CMB\u2014a signature of the universe\u2019s transformation from a foggy soup of particles to a clear, transparent expanse that allows light to travel freely. **Precision Measurements** The CLASS team employed a sophisticated observational strategy that involved continuously scanning the sky in azimuth while applying innovative filtering techniques to remove spurious noise from the Earth\u2019s atmosphere, electronics, and even reflections between telescope components. The researchers\u2019 key finding is a measurement of the so-called \u2018reionization optical depth,\u2019 denoted by the symbol \u03c4 (tau). This parameter quantifies the probability that a CMB photon scattered off a free electron liberated during reionization. A precise measurement of \u03c4 is crucial as it provides a direct probe of the amount of matter in the universe and the nature of the primordial density fluctuations that gave rise to the large-scale structure we observe today.

The newly published results stem from over 115 detector years of 90 GHz polarization data collected between 2018 and 2024 using a specialized modulator known as a variable-delay polarization modulator (VPM). This device helps suppress unwanted signals and improves sensitivity to polarized light\u2014an essential capability for teasing out the delicate reionization signature. The researchers explained that looking back at theCosmic Dawnusing polarization is like wearing polarized sunglasses to cut through the sun\u2019s glare. By filtering out the cosmic glare, scientists could reveal what lies beneath. **First-Ever Ground-Based Measurement an \u201cImpressive Leap Forward\u201d** \u201cNo other ground-based experiment can do what CLASS is doing,\u201d said Nigel Sharp, program director in the NSF Division of Astronomical Sciences, which has supported the CLASS instrument and research team since 2010. \u201cThe CLASS team has greatly improved measurement of the cosmic microwave polarization signal, and this impressive leap forward is a testament to the scientific value produced by NSF\u2019s long-term support.\u201d According to Charles Bennett, a Bloomberg Distinguished Professor at Johns Hopkins who led the WMAP space mission, the team\u2019s success is \u201c an important frontier of cosmic microwave background research.\u201d He also hopes future analysis of the CLASS data will help the team reach the \u201chighest possible precision that\u2019s achievable.\u201d \u201cFor us, the universe is like a physics lab,\u201d Bennet said. \u201cBetter measurements of the universe help to refine our understanding of dark matter and neutrinos, abundant but elusive particles that fill the universe.\u201d Christopher Plain is a Science Fiction and Fantasy novelist and Head Science Writer at The Debrief.
