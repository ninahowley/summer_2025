Pritzker gives barn-burning speech to energize Democrats** Posted byHeather Cox Richardson|May 1, 2025 There has been a change afoot in the Democratic Party for a while now as its leaders shift from trying to find common ground with Republicans to standing firmly against MAGAs and articulating their own vision for the United States. That shift burst dramatically into the open last night when Democratic Illinois governor J.B. Pritzker gave a barn-burning speech to Democrats in New Hampshire. After walking out to the American Authors song \u201cGo Big or Go Home,\u201d Pritzker urged Democrats to stop listening to \u201cdo-nothing political types\u201d who are calling for caution at a time when Americans are demanding urgent action, and to \u201cfight\u2014EVERYWHERE AND ALL AT ONCE.\u201d Pritzker highlighted three ordinary Americans who are opposing the Trump administration and Elon Musk\u2019s \u201cDepartment of Government Efficiency\u201d by building communities to protest, hanging an upside-down flag on the face of Yosemite National Park\u2019s famous cliff El Capitan, and welcoming Vice President J.D. Vance to Sugarbush Resort in Vermont with a snow report calling attention to the administration\u2019s attacks on veterans, people with disabilities, LGBTQ+ Americans, immigrant workers, and people of color. He urged Democrats to lead with the same passion. He listed the positions on which he wants Democrats to stand firm, beginning: \u201cIt\u2019s wrong to snatch a person off the street and ship them to a foreign gulag with no chance to defend themselves in a court of law.\u201d This is not about immigration, he said, but about the Constitution. \u201cStanding for the idea that the government doesn\u2019t have the right to kidnap you without due process is arguably the MOST EFFECTIVE CAMPAIGN SLOGAN IN HISTORY,\u201d he said. \u201cToday, it\u2019s an immigrant with a tattoo. Tomorrow, it\u2019s a citizen whose Facebook post annoys Trump.\u201d Pritzker tore into the MAGA myth that Democrats want rapists and murderers on the streets, saying that Democrats do not want undocumented immigrants who are convicted of violent crimes to stay in the country. He called for \u201creal, sensible immigration reform.\u201d But, he said, \u201cImmigration\u2014with all its struggles and its complexities, is part of the secret sauce that makes America great, always. Immigrants strengthen our communities, enrich our neighborhoods, renew our passion for America\u2019s greatness, enliven our music and our culture, enhance understanding of the world. The success of our economy depends upon immigrants. In fact, forty-six percent \u2026 of Fortune 500 companies were founded by immigrants or the children of immigrants.\u201d Trump\u2019s attacks on immigrants, he said, are likely to make the U.S. economy fail. Indeed, he suggested, making America fail is the point of the Trump administration\u2019s actions. \u201cWe have a Secretary of Education who hates teachers and schools,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a Secretary of Transportation who hates public transit. We have an Attorney General who hates the Constitution. We have a Secretary of State, the son of naturalized citizens, a family of refugees, on a crusade to expel our country of both. \u201cWe have a head of the Department of Government Efficiency, an immigrant granted the privilege of living and working here, a man who has made hundreds of billions of dollars after the government rescued his business for him, who is looking to destroy the American middle class to fund tax cuts for himself. And we have a President who claims to love America but who hates our military so much that he calls them \u2018losers\u2019 and \u2018suckers\u2019 and who can\u2019t be bothered to delay his golf game to greet the bodies of four fallen US soldiers. And we have a Grand Old Party, founded by one of our nation\u2019s bravest Presidents, Abraham Lincoln\u2014who today would be a Democrat, I might add\u2026 so afraid of the felon and the fraud that they put in the White House that they would sooner watch him destroy our country than lift a hand to save it.\u201d He called on Democrats to \u201cstop wondering if you can trust the nuclear codes to people who don\u2019t know how to organize a group chat. It\u2019s time to stop ignoring the hypocrisy in wearing a big gold cross while announcing the defunding of children\u2019s cancer research. And time to stop thinking we can reason or negotiate with a madman. Time to stop apologizing when we were NOT wrong. Time to stop surrendering, when we need to fight. \u201cOur small businesses don\u2019t deserve to be bankrupted by unsustainable tariffs. Our retirees don\u2019t deserve to be left destitute by a Social Security Administration decimated by Elon Musk. Our citizens don\u2019t deserve to lose healthcare coverage because Republicans want to hand a tax cut to billionaires. Our federal workers don\u2019t deserve to have, well, a 19-year-old DOGE bro called Big Balls destroy their careers. \u201cAutistic kids and adults who are loving contributors to our society don\u2019t deserve to be stigmatized by a weird nepo baby who once stashed a dead bear in the backseat of his car. \u201cOur military servicemembers don\u2019t deserve to be told by a washed up Fox TV commentator, who drank too much and committed sexual assault before being appointed Secretary of Defense, that they can\u2019t serve this country simply because they\u2019re Black or gay or a woman. \u201cAnd If it sounds like I\u2019m becoming contemptuous of Donald Trump and the people that he has elevated, it\u2019s because\u2026 I am. You should be too. They are an affront to every value this country was founded upon.\u201d Pritzker called on Democrats to be \u201cbold and our ideas fearless\u2026. And we must deliver on that agenda for working families and for the real people who truly make America great.\u201d \u201cI understand the tendency to give in to despair right now,\u201d he said, \u201cBut despair is an indulgence that we cannot afford in the times upon which history turns. Never before in my life have I called for mass protests, for mobilization, for disruption. But I am now. \u201cThese Republicans cannot know a moment of peace. They have to understand that we will fight their cruelty with every megaphone and microphone that we have. We must castigate them on the soap box, and then punish them at the ballot box. They must feel in their bones that when we survive this shameful episode of American history with our democracy intact\u2014because we have no alternative but to do just that\u2014that we will relegate their portraits to the museum halls reserved for tyrants and traitors.\u201d \u201cCowardice can be contagious,\u201d Pritzker said, \u201cBut so too can courage\u2026. Just as the hope that we hold onto in the darkness, shines with its own\u2026special light. \u201cTonight, I\u2019m telling you what I\u2019m willing to do\u2026is fight\u2014for our democracy, for our liberty, for the opportunity for all our people to live lives that are meaningful and free. And I see around me tonight a roomful of people who are ready to do the same.\u201d \u201cSo I have one question for all of you,\u201d Pritzker said. \u201cAre you ready for the fight?\u201d Written By \u00a9 Photo Subscribe H\u0435\u0430th\u0435r C\u043ex R\u0456ch\u0430rds\u043en Reba Saldanha (AP) Letters from an \u0410mericanis a daily email newsletter written by Heather Cox Richardson, about the history behind today\u2019s politics Share: **About The Author** Heather Cox Richardson is Professor of History at Boston College and an expert on American political and economic history.
