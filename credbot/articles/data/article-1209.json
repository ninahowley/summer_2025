On the newest episode of thebigcitysmalltownpodcast, host Robert Rivard talks withDingivan, who recently departed the nonprofit after eight years, and Zlotnick, a faculty member at St. Mary\u2019s University School of Law. **Never miss San Antonio Report's biggest stories.** Sign up forThe Recap, a newsletter rundown of the most important news, delivered every Monday and Thursday. \u0394 Dingivan recalled the association\u2019s origins, which date back more than 20 years ago when then-Judge Karen Pozza and Justice Phylis Speedlin saw a need to offer pro bono services to individuals of limited means or people who find themselves vulnerable due to overwhelming circumstances. According to a 2022 study commissioned by the Legal Services Corporation, 92% of civil legal issues experienced by low-income Americans receive little to any adequate help from a legal professional. A group called the Community Justice Program, a forerunner of SALSA, initially had ties to the San Antonio Bar Association, whose members voted in 2019 to formally make SALSA independent. Dingivan said she and her colleagues were preparing a kickoff event for March 2020 to officially recognize SALSA as an independent organization. That is when, as she put it, \u201cthe world changed\u201d with the emergence of COVID-19 and the resulting public health emergency. The volunteer attorneys and their support staff pivoted because of business closures, layoffs, evictions, foreclosures, and other personal emergencies that many residents faced at the height of the pandemic. \u201cWe immediately began building projects and programs that were responsive to the unique legal needs that were cropping up during the pandemic,\u201d Dingivan said. Initiatives that SALSA launched during the pandemic remain, including a small estate help desk, which provides free legal aid for low-income individuals at the Bexar County Courthouse every other Thursday afternoon. Dingivan said a volunteer lawyer can help a client, who is distraught over their personal loss, and who might be uneducated about how the legal system may address their estate questions. \u201cObviously, the people who are encountering (the probate court) are in the middle of a grieving process, and are entering it at a disadvantage, and the ability to navigate the complexity of that process without a lawyer is really hard,\u201d she added. Dingivan said the COVID-19 outbreak prompted SALSA\u2019s volunteers and staff to innovate on how to serve their clients during the pandemic, especially those who have little to no internet access, and clients who were unable to reach government offices to personally discuss matters regarding their benefits. \u201cWe were balancing a need to change the way we were delivering services with a need to make sure we were not affirmatively blocking people from access because of technological and language barriers that exist when you\u2019re creating remote opportunities for engagement,\u201d she said. Zlotnick said the pandemic exacerbated many residents\u2019 efforts to acquire or maintainaffordable, stable housing, but those struggles have lessened thanks in part to the city\u2019s Strategic Housing Implementation Plan (SHIP) and voters\u2019 passage of the city\u2019s 2022 affordable housing bond. Zlotnick said he hopes the city will continue efforts toward expanding affordable housing under a new mayor and City Council. He added that SALSA continues to aid renters and homeowners who may face eviction or foreclosure. \u201cIt really benefits all San Antonians to make those long-term investments,\u201d he added. Dingivan said, in order to make SALSA even more effective, the nonprofit can increasecommunity partnerships, such as the one it has with Morgan\u2019s Multi-Assistance Center, a community center that serves individuals with various disabilities and special needs.\u201c(Morgan\u2019s MAC members) have specific civic legal needs,\u201d Dingivan said, adding that its members often have questions about guardianship or accessing benefits. Dingivan also hopes SALSA will grow the number of volunteer attorneys, which numbers between 300-500 yearly. Zlotnick said, while teaching law at St. Mary\u2019s University, he reminds law students of the positives of volunteering to help individuals who are enduring socioeconomic struggles. \u201cIt really is an opportunity to engage on some of those expressions and address thosesymptoms, and try to alleviate not just the momentary stresses that clients present themselves with at (Morgan\u2019s) MAC or at eviction court,\u201d Zlotnick said. Dingivan said many SALSA volunteer attorneys, at first, never expect to make a positivedifference in the life of a client in need of free legal civil assistance. \u201cThe feedback we get is that, \u2018I had no idea my skills could impact somebody this way.\u2019 That\u2019s really the call to action for our lawyers in town,\u201d she added. **Before you go...** We have a small favor to ask.
