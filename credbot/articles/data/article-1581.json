On July 17, 2024, EPAopenedits initial investigation into the ASPECT flight mission over East Palestine, Ohio, following the toxic derailment in February 2023 and whistleblowerdisclosurefrom former ASPECT data quality manager and creator of the ASPECT software, Dr. Robert Kroutil. In the report, EPA OIG found the On-Scene Coordinators may have been unaware of the technology\u2019s abilities and recommended the coordinators be trained on the plane\u2019s capabilities. The report concluded that the procedures remain \u201clargely unknown to all stakeholders\u201d and there is a lack of clarity that could negatively impact emergency decision-making, leaving EPA without a formal deployment guide for ASPECT. However, parts of Dr. Kroutil\u2019s disclosure were not addressed in the final report, including the incomplete data that was passed over for analysis and sensors being turned off during the flight. \u201cWhile the EPA OIG report vindicates Dr. Kroutil by confirming systemic procedural deficiencies and knowledge gaps that supported his broader concerns about ASPECT program management, the investigation\u2019s scope was too narrow, failing to address the most serious allegations about data collection practices, sensor shutdowns, and potential report manipulation,\u201dGovernment Accountability Project\u2019s Senior Environmental Officer, Lesley Pacey,commented. \u201cDr. Kroutil\u2019s courage in coming forward has already led to meaningful policy improvements, but a more comprehensive investigation into the substantive allegations about data collection and analysis would better serve the public interest and ensure accountability for this critical environmental disaster response.\u201d Government Accountability Project whistleblower client, Dr. Robert Kroutil, added, \u201cI disagree with the assessment in the report that EPA followed established deployment protocols. The report noted that EPA officials believe that the on-ground monitoring equipment provided superior detection capabilities, which is incorrect. This demonstrates EPA\u2019s complete lack of understanding of the ASPECT technology and how it works to protect chemically impacted sites.\u201d Contact:[email protected] Government Accountability Project Government Accountability Project is the nation\u2019s leading whistleblower protection organization.
