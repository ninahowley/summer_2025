On the one hand, there is a spiritually oriented, almost pacifist organization that goes by names such as \u2018Confederation of Planets,\u2019 \u2018Galactic Confederation,\u2019 \u2018Confederation of Light,\u2019 etc. On the other hand, organizations such as the \u2018Galactic Federation of Worlds\u2019 and the \u2018Ashtar Command\u2019 are more military-oriented and interventionist in dealing with negative extraterrestrial activities and influences. The Confederation of Planets takes a more long-term spiritual approach, emphasizing nonviolence, cosmic consciousness, education, and love. In short, the \u201cConfederation\u201d is a loosely bound, noninterventionist, almost pacifist galactic alliance. In contrast, the \u201cFederation,\u201d has a more tightly integrated structure that includes a unified military that facilitates direct intervention in galactic conflicts. In this exopolitical commentary, Dr. Michael Salla discusses the Confederation of Planets and how it differs from the Galactic Federation of Worlds in conflict resolution. He cites extensively from his book, Galactic Federations, Councils and Secret Space Programs (2022), to provide sources and information describing these different extraterrestrial organizations, and how they intervene to improve the human situation.
