Gov. Sylvia Luke signed into law Monday a bill that moves the office responsible for improving broadband internet access statewide from the Department of Business, Economic Development and Tourism to the Department of Accounting and General Services. Lt. Gov. Sylvia Luke signed into law Monday a bill that moves the office responsible for improving broadband internet access statewide from the Department of Business, Economic Development and Tourism to the Department of Accounting and General Services. Luke said the new law takes \u201ca necessary step toward a future where every resident, regardless of geography, regardless of age or income, can connect to and use affordable, reliable broadband internet to access education, health care and economic opportunity.\u201d During an event held at the Hawaii Public Library in Honolulu, Luke \u2014 who is acting governor while Gov. Josh Green is in Washington, D.C., on business \u2014 signed into law House Bill 934. The measure \u2014 introduced by Rep. Greggor Ilagan, a Puna Democrat, with co-signers including the entire contingent of Big Island House members \u2014 changes the name of the Hawaii Broadband and Digital Equity Office to, simply, the Broadband Office. It also appropriates funds. \u201cThis law not only lays the groundwork for much needed services, it also helps ensure keiki through kupuna acquire the skills and support they need to use the internet to improve their daily lives,\u201d Luke said. It\u2019s about giving more internet options to that tutu in Paauilo who cannot rely on her spotty internet connection for her health care and telehealth appointment. It\u2019s about a job seeker in Hanapepe trying to fill out an online application but gets stuck when the website only accepts a specific file format. And it\u2019s about an uncle in Waimanalo who got a brand new tablet and wants to go online to do online banking, but doesn\u2019t know where to start.\u201d Luke called $6 million in federal digital equity funding recently cut by the Trump administration \u201cjust part of the funding.\u201d \u201cThe entire broadband funding is close to $400 million,\u201d she said, referring to Connect Kakou, the statewide broadband initiative spearheaded by Green\u2019s office to ensure that communities across Hawaii have access to reliable and affordable high-speed internet. \u201cThis bill supports strategic broadband coordination and digital skills to improve the lives of people from all walks of life. With the Broadband Office under the Department of Accounting and General Services, we can now align the office with broader strategic technology management and governance. Furthermore, the allocations aligned in this bill will have a greater impact on the Digital Navigators program, which completed a successful pilot in 2023, thanks to the successful efforts of the State Librarian Stacy Aldrich.\u201d Aldrich called the Digital Navigators pilot \u2014 which provided one-one-one counselors by appointment to program participants seeking to either establish or improve computer literacy \u2014 \u201ca very successful program.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re now working on a project to expand that program across the state,\u201d Aldrich said. \u201cAnd we look forward to working with our sister agencies on making sure that people have more access to people (who) can help them get the skills they need to be successful.\u201d She said a target date for the introduction of the statewide program would likely be this fall. Beth Rasmussen, a senior citizen from Kaneohe, Oahu, and Digital Navigator pilot participant, said she\u2019s \u201cso delighted to hear that the program is going to be resumed.\u201d \u201cThere were so many gaps that \u2026 these instructors filled for me,\u201d she said. \u201c\u2026 Being able to create a file \u2014 now I know that sounds terribly simple, but how do you do it when you have no idea? The computer says \u2018create a file\u2019 \u2026 and then what? Then what? You know, you stand there and you think OK, where does the next direction come? \u201cWell, I got to scan all my pictures into the computer. They taught me how to do that, how to create a file, how to label a file, how to change the label of a file, how to delete pictures \u2026 and to be able to respond to somebody in an email.\u201d House Speaker Nadine Nakamura of Kauai noted \u201ca lot of thought and effort that went behind this bill.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m excited because I learned during the pandemic that there are many people without internet access and access to high-speed broadband connection on my island \u2014 and, I\u2019m sure, throughout the state,\u201d Nakamura said. These are residents of Hawaii who were laid off from jobs and who could not access unemployment insurance benefits, people who could not access other state and county benefits, and also \u2026 students who did not have access to the internet or whose families could not afford the cost of that internet connection. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why this bill is so important, because it helps to level the playing field. It helps to lift families up and have access to resources over the internet that many of us take for granted. I\u2019m most excited about the Digital Navigator positions that will be expanded throughout our state through our public libraries. By placing the navigators through our libraries, we can do so much to \u2026 touch many more lives.\u201d The Tribune-Herald reached out to Ilagan, who didn\u2019t respond in time for this story.
