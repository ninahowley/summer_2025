They can turn from a human into a cat in seconds but they can not turn back into a human for some hours. This skeleton looks like it was turning into a cat and got killed before the transmogrification was complete as the head is the last bit to change. These people are of ancient Greek and Egyptian ancestors and originally come from another galaxy. They tend to be very wealthy and hold positions of power and high esteem.Reply Cat people still exist today.
