The secret government has slipped up and allowed the release of a History Channel special that spills the beans on the whole Chemtrail program! Several clips from this show areavailable on youtube: The unfortunate thing about the show is that, regarding \u201cchemtrails\u201d it\u2019s all theory and zero facts. Far from \u201cvalidating\u201d any chemtrail theory, the show simplyrepeatsthe theory. What\u2019s more it\u2019s basically just a platform for William Thomas to repeat the same nonsense he\u2019s been spouting for the last ten years, totally ignoring both science and common sense. For Example: Thomas: I think most of us in North America have been wondering about these plumes criss-crossing the sky in grid patterns, rows, and the now-familiar X\u2019s, and many of us have wondered what these trails are. Well, actually no \u2013 most peopledon\u2019twonder what these plumes are. And for those that do, we know EXACTLY what they are. They are contrails. This hasbeen explained time and time again, with vast amounts of scientific and historical evidence behind the explanation. What evidence does Thomas give? None. Zero. Zip. Nada.In fact, Thomas\u2019sentiretheory is based on a simple misconception that he continues to repeat over and over, totally ignoring all evidence to the contrary. He claims that \u201cnormal\u201d contrails vanish in a few seconds, and that \u201cchemtrails\u201d last for hours. This is demonstrably untrue. Contrails last for a varying amount of time based on the weather at the altitude they form. They can last for hours, and spread out to cover the sky. Any book on clouds will tell you this, and spreading contrails havebeen observed since 1921. Yet Thomas manages to get his nonsense into the show: VO: They first appear to be simply contrails, coming from high flying jet airplanes. But these trails linger in the sky for many hours, some for even an entire day, forming an artificial cloud It seems that, like Thomas, the writers of the show chose to ignore the fact that THIS IS WHAT CONTRAILS SOMETIMES DO!! You simply need to read the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica article onvapour trails (contrails): Contrail,streamer of cloud sometimes observed behind an airplane flying in clear, cold, humid air. It forms upon condensation of the water vapour produced by the combustion of fuel in the airplane engines. When the ambient relative humidity is high, the resultingice-crystal plume may last for several hours. The trail may be distorted by the winds, andsometimes it spreads outwards to form a layer of cirrus cloud.vapour trail. (2007). InEncyclop\u00e6dia Britannica.Retrieved May 4, 2007,from Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online:http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9074829 Or read \u201cA Field Guide to the Atmosphere\u201c, by Schaefer and Day, 1981: \u201cSometimes [contrails] are ephemeral and dissipate as quickly as they form;other times they persist and grow wide enough to cover a substantial portion of the sky with a sheet of cirrostratus\u201c(Page 137) Or read, allthese articles on contrails. In particular the one titled \u201cAirborne Observations of Contrail Effects on the Thermal Radiation Budget\u201c, from 1970: The spreading of jet contrails into extensive cirrus sheets is a familiar sight. Often, when persistent contrails exist from 25,000 to 40,000 ft, several long contrails increase in number andgradually merge into an almost solid interlaced sheet.[\u2026.]Contrail development and spreading begins in the morning hours with the start of heavy jet traffic and may extend from horizon to horizon as the air traffic peaks. Fig. 1 is a typical example of midmorning contrails that occured on 17 December 1969 northwest of Boulder. By midafternoon, sky conditions had developed into those shown in Fig. 2an almost solid contrail sheetreported to average 500 m in depth.

They do shows on UFOs, Psychics, Ancient Astronauts, etc, all without any real pretense of being scientifically objective. They want an entertaining story, and if that means ignoring the facts, and interviewing on the people with the most entertaining theory. I\u2019m sorry that \u201cIt\u2019s just Contrails\u201d is a boring theory.

The History channel is anything but historical but that\u2019s just typical government propaganda for you. I\u2019ve commented here before and I just have to say this. You always talk about the \u201csecret government\u201d like you think that things like that are not happening. Maybe you might want to stop looking at clouds for 5 minutes and see what\u2019s going on on the ground. While they steal your wealth and control your media they use advanced mind control to manipulate people. This media bomb puts Chemtrails in the mainstream which is totally counter revolutionary. That\u2019s why they do it! They LOVE to stoke those flames because it keeps peoples eyes off their dirty dealings. They control the meda 100% and so if anything this little gem should debunk Chemtrails before it ever validates them. But alot of people are pretty stupid! They don\u2019t get it even when they know not to trust the media. They just pick and choose when it suits their agenda. They can\u2019t see how they are being bitch slapped by their own conspiracy.The FED is your government trying to pass the reigns to the IMF. Bilderberg and the CFR control the media so this doesn\u2019t get on TV unless they say so. All nations are being bought and sold by multi-national corporations and banks behind the scenes. So stop with your tying Chemtrail/Contrail whatever with the FACT that there is a \u201csecret government\u201d globalizing everything right now.

Some of these are fairly obvious.What I\u2019d dispute is this clear picture that people try to portray, of the Federal Reserve, and the CFR and the Bildebergers being some kind of global cabal with a specific agenda. I think there\u2019s just a bunch of rich and powerful people who want to stay rich and powerful. Occasionally they will tacitly collude. But is there some worldwide organization that has deliberately created the \u201cchemtrail\u201d myth, and uses their total control of the media to fan the flames with History channel shows in order to distract from their greater evil? I see nothing at all to suggest that. \u201cChemtrails\u201d, and other conspiracy theories, need no help from the powers-that-be to get traction. It\u2019s always been like this. People like to believe in things. The History channel likes to get viewers. That\u2019s all there is evidence for.checkthemapsays:July 27, 2009 at 9:42 pmHello,I have a question for whomever is in charge of this website.Please explain one phenomenon I just witnessed, if you would.On a hot, dry afternoon (about 2:30), in a totally clear blue sky over the Rocky Mountains in New Mexico, a small smudge is noticed. It has no definite shape. It looks like cloud vapor. It looks smeared and a little dirty. It does not resemble any naturally occurring cloud. It has no edges, but looks like something blurry hanging incongruously high up in the air.It is not fog. It is not rising up out of the mountains. It is not one of the first clouds that regularly appear over the mountains early in the day, which mean it will later rain as the clouds quickly roll in from the desert and gather over the mountains, eventually producing a monsoon. All these things are very familiar to anyone who lives here.Again, it is high in the sky \u2014 which is otherwise perfectly clear.Within ten minutes, the smear has grown to triple its original size. It has simply expanded in all directions, but remains fuzzy, undefined, murky looking. It is now a very large suspended glob in the middle of the sky.The glob then proceeds to literally EJECT cloud vapor.The cloud vapor comes POURING out of the glob in the sky, heading East, in a sheet.The cloud vapor spreads rapidly across the sky \u2014 emanating completely from the amorphous blob, which is now very big, maybe six or seven times its original size, or larger.So now, we have a huge amorphous blob of murky vapor, from which is pouring a thin sheet of white vapor, extended like an arm across the sky.The people who have parked their cars to watch this occurrence now see a few white jets appear.As they fly by, long white trails extend from the plane, and within about five minutes, nine parallel lines have been laid out alongside and within the long sheet of vapor extending from the original blob.Finally one of the planes lays one extremely long trail across all the other parallel trails \u2014 almost as if sowing them together.Then the planes disappear, and the blob ceases to produce any more vapor.All the vapor in the sky lingers for the rest of the day.If this is a natural occurrence, please tell me what it was. I have never seen anything like it in my life.Uncinus (Mick)says:July 28, 2009 at 9:14 amIt sounds like clouds forming in the east, possibly with a lenticular cloud (the \u201cglob\u201d), and then some contrails.But really it\u2019s hard to tell without photos. Time lapse video is also very revealing. Have a look at some of these:http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=timelapse+lenticular+contrails&search_type=&aq=fThis one in particular looks quite \u201cglob\u201d-like:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5siFGdBZkscheckthemapsays:July 28, 2009 at 9:58 amI know that it sounds like a lenticular cloud, if anything. And you\u2019re right, you need to see photos.But it wasn\u2019t a lenticular cloud. In ten years of living in these mountains and watching the sky constantly I\u2019ve never seen anything like it.I posted two other comments to this site last night and now I don\u2019t see them. Did I forget where I posted them, or did you not allow them up for some reason?Uncinus (Mick)says:July 28, 2009 at 10:28 amComments show up under the post they were posted on. They can take some time to be approved, a couple of days sometime, if I\u2019m away.

Let\u2019s be grown ups. You seem like a smart guy. Common sense will inform you as to how the world works. You are right that there are a bunch of rich and powerful people who want to stay that way. But they do not just occasionally collude. THAT\u2019S ALL THEY DO.The collusion of powerful people is what runs politics and the economy, the military industrial complex, and every secret program and covert war. These people operate on a level far beyond what most poor shmucks can imagine as they sit in front of their TV scratching their balls and swilling beer and wondering why everyone they know is poor or sick, or both.The rich and powerful are a force that controls life on this planet. They control politicians, corporations, and the mainstream media. I don\u2019t believe they control everything at all moments or that they are invincible or that they are aliens or that they are all Satanists who drink the blood of the children, etc, etc . . But to belittle their true power and unity in the real world is a dangerous absurdity.Collusion and conspiracy and necessary secrecy is the name of the game, every day, at the top levels of power.Uncinus (Mick)says:July 28, 2009 at 12:31 pmOkay then, lets assume that\u2019s true. Let\u2019s also assume that the government has a secret weather modification program. Now, what evidence is there that contrails are any different to how they have always been? Because that\u2019s really the bottom line here. Either they have changed or they have not. If they have not, then the chemtrail theory is bunk, and you are just left with a non-specific they-are-probably-doing-it weather modification theory.And by evidence, I mean photos, videos, measurements, etc. If you go by millions of eyewitness accounts, you\u2019d also have to admit ghosts, angels, UFOs and Bigfoot into the equation.SR1419says:July 28, 2009 at 3:10 pmTHAT\u2019S ALL THEY DO.That is simply not true.(talk about choking on coffee)History is riddled with rich and powerful people COMPETING with each other for their own ends and means\u2026Et Tu Brutus??Surely you are not that naive.checkthemapsays:July 28, 2009 at 6:15 pmFirst, SR1419 . . .No, I am not naive. A lot of other things, maybe, but not naive.Of course the rich and powerful compete, that isn\u2019t at issue. But when do they not compete? They don\u2019t compete when they are working together to keep everyone else down.It\u2019s like the two supposed political parties in the US. They differ on many issues, often more than intheory than in practice, but on some levels they are definitely separate parties. But look at how often they cross all party lines to work together to further the interests of who? The wealthy and powerful.Foreign policy, economic globalization, the War on Drugs and Terror and whatever else, the increase in prisons and the prison population \u2014 this has all continued along pretty much the same lines for a long time, regardless of the party in power, who controls Congress.The powerful seem to play good cop, bad cop a lot \u2014 the Democrats are sort of the nicer cop who might get you an extra blanket for the cold night in your cell \u2014 the Republicans are the cops who will beat your head in with a gun butt \u2014 but in the end, it\u2019s the same prison, and you\u2019re still not the one in charge.Like George W. Bush said \u2014 on camera \u2014 the \u201celites\u201d are his base.Well, they\u2019re Obama\u2019s base too, and every other politician. The rest of the people are simply appeased and entertained as much as possible, until they have to be tasered.Anyway.Yes, the rich and powerful compete \u2014 they also kill each other and destroy each other\u2019s empires \u2014 but if the rabble start to really rise up, they will align to put them down however they can.Whereas the Communists just tried to harness the energy of the rabble to destroy their own enemies . . .But I\u2019m digressing.And I\u2019m sure you get my point.When I say the rich and powerful collude all the time, I\u2019m not talking only about back room, underground conspiracies. I\u2019m talking about being \u201cin the club\u201d and associating with each other all the time, making deals constantly, business or otherwise, legal and illegal, or a little of both, and helping each other get around the rules all the dumbasses at the bottom have to follow.That\u2019s all \u2014 it\u2019s just all that they do. And if they have to lie, they lie. They control judges and politicians, and the editors of all the major news sources.However, this is all really common sense \u2014 of COURSE they do. What the fuck do you think being rich and powerful is about, anyway?? Having to stand in line? Having to answer up? Having to play by the rules?No. That is for peasants, not the stunningly wealthy people who live on a plane very different from anyone else.It doesn\u2019t mean they are immune, and they can be brought down, but mostly they will rise back up again. Why? Because they\u2019re rich, and powerful . . . Someone has to be.checkthemapsays:July 28, 2009 at 6:24 pmUncinus wrote:Okay then, lets assume that\u2019s true.

If I find it I\u201dll repost it here.But one problem is that I don\u2019t have measurements. I wish I did, but I don\u2019t know how to get them. And the reasons why are obvious, I don\u2019t have access to those kinds of resources. And if you go by my wacky conspiracy theory, the reason no major studies exist is because no gov\u2019t agency will get funded to do it \u2014 cause it\u2019s secret.There are literally thousands of photos, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve seen them. If you don\u2019t find anything strange in them, then you and I have a profound difference in our perceptual realities.And as far as ghosts, angels, UFOs and Bigfoot goes, I have no reason whatsoever to deny the existence of these things. Ghosts I\u2019ve experienced myself, angels I HOPE are true (that would be nice, wouldn\u2019t it?), UFOs are only unidentified objects \u2014 which could be anything, so who knows? they\u2019re undentified! \u2014 and Bigfoot . . . well, listen, stranger things have happened. It\u2019s a big planet, there could be some weird stuff hiding in the wild places.What I do know is that all of the things listed above are kind of interesting and sexy in a way \u2014 but not chemtrails.

Please, pick what you consider to be the most inexplicable photo, so I can see what you are talking about. Because everything I\u2019ve seen looks like a contrail. Show me something that does not (and make sure you check \u201cClouds of the World\u201d first, to make sure it\u2019s not in there).No need to debate the shadow government(s), just take that as read, and we\u2019ll go from there. This site is about contrails, and the chemtrail theory.checkthemapsays:July 28, 2009 at 6:56 pmIn order to do that, I would have to go searching. This is actually the first chemtrail board I\u2019ve been part of in years, because I had to drop the whole thing to save my sanity for a while. I left the country and was living in Mexico, where I never saw one chemtrail, and it was lovely.So I don\u2019t have links anymore to my favorite grid pix, I\u2019d have to go searching online, and we both know it won\u2019t matter \u2014 you will tell me everything in the picture is normal. I can save you the effort.And I agree with you that chemtrails look a whole lot like contrails. Because I\u2019m sure they are, in part, actually contrails. They are vapor trails \u2014 but what is included in that vapor? And why?checkthemapsays:July 28, 2009 at 6:58 pmAnd Uncinus \u2014 you can\u2019t easily separate the issue of a shadow government from the chemtrail issue, can you? I mean, if the latter is true, the former essentially needs to be true, to carry it off.Suntoursays:July 29, 2009 at 12:53 amBy checkthemap,\u201cWhat I do know is that all of the things listed above are kind of interesting and sexy in a way \u2014 but not chemtrails. Everyone I know who \u201cbelieves\u201d in them wishes to god they\u2019d go away so they could stop thinking about them.\u201dIf that were true, chemtrailers would actually read this site with an open mind and realize that everything people claim to be chemtrail related: x\u2019s, grids, curving contrails, spreading & persisting contrails etc are the atmosphere\u2019s reaction to a jet airplane flying through it (with the right set of conditions). They would also realize that \u201cchemclouds\u201d \u201cblack clouds\u201d and sundog type phenomena, are nothing more than natural. They\u2019re clouds & the sun passing through ice crystals, which people have never bothered to notice before. Wave clouds, street clouds, sundogs, halos, clouds between the observer and the Sun which they view as \u201cdark and unnatural\u201d.It\u2019s plain to see that most of the chemtrailer/chemcloud believers aren\u2019t nearly as open minded as they claim to be. If they were, they wouldn\u2019t purposely dismiss scientific & meterological explanations and over 60 years of photographic evidence. Yet they blindly accept the existance of \u201cchemtrails\u201d without one shred of hard evidence.Disco Stusays:July 29, 2009 at 11:47 amUncinus, can you comment as to why the clouds on the left side of this aerial map are arranged in straight lines?http://rapidfire.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/subsets/?subset=AERONET_CCNY.2009209.terra.250mUncinus (Mick)says:July 29, 2009 at 1:06 pmThere are several ways in in which clouds form straight line, but basically it boils down to air essentially being a fluid, and forming waves. Under some conditions, the waves are parallel. See:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_cloudAlso, different, yet related:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_streetThe rows of clouds are not always contiguous, as you can see. And it\u2019s nothing new, here\u2019s some from 1905:http://picasaweb.google.com/Uncinus/CloudStudies1905And1925#sovereignpatriotusasays:July 29, 2009 at 8:04 pmFirst,There are several ways in in which clouds form straight line, but basically it boils down to air essentially being a fluid, and forming waves.so 2+2 = 5 does it?That is a very blatant misrepresentation, and thought I would think it silly to necessitate a notation, let\u2019s throw it in just to cover all bases.http://wiki.answers.com/Q/Is_air_a_gas_or_liquidSecond, your Arthur Hayden picture is mislabelled. The correct name for parallel line cloud formations is Altostratus Undulatus, an easy typo for the editor in 1925 to make. This formation is very rare, and primarily precipitates bad weather such as rainfall.One of the best tools for climatologists, meteorologists, and interested lay-people is the book \u201cThe Weather Wizard Cloud Book\u201d. In it, you will find all the tools necessary to understand weather patterns in a time-tested and history proven way with tons of high-quality photographs.Nowhere in the book are examples of contrails-turned-super cloud formations, even though the work was developed even into the 1980\u2019s.Any attempt to discredit the integrity, and contribution to the science of meteorology by Louis Rubin, will be an abject and epic failure. For, as anybody truly in the field of study will tell you the \u2018Wythe Avenue Weather Wizard\u2019 could call it like no other.And lastly,The case for aerosol saturation of the environment with toxic heavy metals for use with cutting-edge communications and weapons projects involving HAARP and similar programs are just too much to ignore.For instance, the Eastland patent of which I know you are aware, which yet again outlines plans for barium dispersal.http://www.patentstorm.us/patents/4686605.htmlSome other threads we could pull on if we had more clearance are here:http://www.dtic.mil/srch/doc?collection=t3&id=AD0739194{{Studies of Barium Excitation by Molecular Beam Magnetic Resonance Techniques.}}http://www.dtic.mil/srch/doc?collection=t3&id=ADA121087{{Numerical Simulation of a Possible Freezing and Sheet Formation Mechanism for Barium Cloud Striations.}}Additionally, other military programs outline the use of barium oxide and aluminum oxide for propagating EMF waves. If you read the Eastland patent (found here again or at another website of your choicehttp://www.patentstorm.us/patents/4686605.html) then you would be aware of this being \u2018proposed\u2019 over 20 years ago.Are we to assume the military has just been sitting on its hands in regards to this type of technology?There are just too many official sources outlining the use of such materials. Some I have posted above, others like this patent from Bernard Eastland (which I am aware has been presented to you before\u2026) can be directly backed up with videos such as this:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxRnkfvO_EUI am taking the temporary position that con/chemtrails need not necessarily be part of any plan for global depopulation per se, and that will allow us to focus on their application as part of a possible undisclosed program aimed at command and control of the global airspace, both atmospheric and electromagnetic.Again, that video ishttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxRnkfvO_EUIf in fact the military security apparatus is using a top-level program to modify the conditions of the battlespace (which they have always done as far as they could reach), and either military or commercial aircraft (or a combination) are being employed to meet their objectives, then we should more closely examine the issue.Is there any reason we should not? Especially when the consequences for detrimental effects on lifeforms exist, completely unintentional or otherwise.Would you argue against it?So, again\u2026just for the sake of a new tact, let\u2019s remind ourselves to leave behind any notion or suspicion regarding biological experimentation using contrails as a vehicle for delivery.We are now completely focusing on the much firmer ground that support the existence of a top-level command/control operation involving atmospheric and electromagnetic programs, which are potentially using aerosols as part of said programs.What can we make of that, Uncinus and clique?TO CHECKTHEMAP:I applaud your approach and perspective.

You can\u2019t, and that means one of those four things is missing from your lifestyle.Just sayin\u2019.Kudos again for Checkthemap, for his (or her) succinct points.Still waiting on you to debunk the work and words of Mr. Eastland and others in that video\u2026.(rustles up some wok made popcorn in amused anticipation).Remain Vigilant.

The correct name for parallel line cloud formations is Altostratus Undulatus, an easy typo for the editor in 1925 to make. This formation is very rare, and primarily precipitates bad weather such as rainfall.Air is a fluid. I never said it was liquid, I said it was a fluid:http://www.google.com/search?q=is+air+a+fluidAs a fluid it has waves and flows much like a liquid does, which results in regular wave-like features in cloud layers. See also:http://www.amazon.com/Fluid-Mechanics-Atmosphere-International-Geophysics/dp/0121370402From the introduction:I don\u2019t think the Hayden photo is mislabeled exactly. The names of clouds went through several evolutions which varied by country, and were not settled at Hayden\u2019s time. Many of the photos had clouds names that don\u2019t exactly match the modern usage. He actually proposed his own name for some cloud types. It\u2019s an interesting book, you can read it in PDF form.sovereignpatriotusasays:July 30, 2009 at 8:50 amUncinus,Ahh, I did misread \u2018fluid\u2019 for \u2018liquid\u2019. Point noted and retracted.Thank you for putting the posts in correct order this morning.Still, the correct term is Altostratus Undulatus. As in \u2018undulate\u2019 from latin \u2018undula\u2019 meaning small wave-like form, the clouds rarely and occasionally form wavelike sheets, which again, are nearly always followed by heavy rainfall.And, as for Eastland and HAARP related programs, it is not even important that the new popular buzzword \u2018Chemtrails\u2019 is not mentioned. What\u2019s important is the description of the program and its applications.If the lay-term for aerosol operations is \u2018chemtrails\u2019, so be it. Does this discount that there are aerosol operations underway? That there have been? That it only makes strategic sense for there to be in the future?The proof is in the scholarly white-papers that may be found with research, and in the thousands of pictures that cannot be explained away as cirrus or altostratus undulatus formations.How can you reach the foregone conclusion that you are in a position to tell us with any authority that no operations are underway? I have asked you what your military clearance is before, and your education, professional background, and personal affiliations and associations. You didn\u2019t answer.In the face of so much documented government hijinks in this and other areas, how can you be so steadfast in your assumption that there is no pink elephant in the middle of the room?Also, since Dr. Hildegarde Staninger has done some work on the dispersal of RFID \u2018smart dust\u2019 for satellite based 3-D imaging and logistics, you may as well watch this other video which covers it some about half-way through.Are you denying this technology exists too, and that aerial dispersal is the most likely vector?http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWTWTHunPkkThese are all different, compartmentalized yet synergistic elements of a top-level command/control operation that is currently publicly classified and undisclosed.How can I say it\u2019s so? How can you say it\u2019s not?Remain Vigilant! Stay Sovereign!!Uncinus (Mick)says:July 30, 2009 at 8:59 amBut my point here is that the supposed \u201cchemtrails\u201d don\u2019t look any different from contrails. If you can\u2019t show that they are different, then all the other stuff is an entirely different topic.So please, focus on that. You mention \u201cthe thousands of pictures that cannot be explained away as cirrus or altostratus undulatus formations\u201d, I presume you mean photos of suspicious contrails, which I\u2019ve already addressed.Perhaps you could give an example?(And I\u2019ll be setting off on a trip shortly, for a couple of weeks, comments will be automatically approved, but I\u2019d appreciate it if you could stay on topic \u2013 contrails vs. chemtrails).sovereignpatriotusasays:July 30, 2009 at 1:41 pmFrom \u2018Unilateral Geoengineering\u2019 authored by the Council on Foreign Relations, 2008.http://www.scribd.com/doc/13725689/Unilateral-Geoengineering-2009\u201cApplied to geoengineering, various technologies could be used to loft particles into thestratosphere, such as naval guns, rockets, hot air balloons or blimps, or a fleet of high-flyingaircraft. Potential types of particles for injection include sulfur dioxide, aluminumoxide dust or even designer self-levitating aerosols that might be engineered to migrate toparticular regions (e.g. over the arctic) or to rise above the stratospher (so as not tointerfere in stratospheric chemistry). Because of the relative horizontal stability of thestratosphere compared to the troposphere, the residence time of injected particles isapproximately 1-2 years.3 As a result, such a scheme would require only annual orbiannual replenishment.\u201d\u201cA 1992 report of the National Research Council4 was the first to systematically estimatethe potential costs of a program of stratospheric albedo modification. Their estimate wasbased on the use of a standard naval gun system dispensing commercial aluminum oxidedust to counteract the warming effect of a CO2 doubling. Undiscounted annual costs for a40-year project were estimated to be $100 billion. More recent analysis5 has suggestedthat well designed systems might reduce this cost to as little as a few hundred milliondollars per year \u2013 clearly well within the budget of almost all nations, and much lesscostly than any program to dramatically reduce the emissions of CO2 . Indeed, there are ahandful of individuals who could create the endowment necessary to generate an annualannuity to operate such a program.\u201d(I bet wonder who they had in mind?\u2026)So let me ask you, if aluminum oxide, barium oxide, or other materials were dispersed from aircraft as stated in that excerpt, and this one:\u201cGeo-engineering, defined here as intentional large-scale manipulation of the globalenvironment, has been suggested as a means of mitigating the effects ofanthropogenic greenhouse-gas emissions on climate, without necessarily reducingemissions. \u201d\u201cA number of geo-engineering options for mitigating the effects of anthropogenicgreenhouse-gas emissions on climate have been proposed. In this paper, weconsider a number of proposals, under two main headings: (i) alteration of theEarth\u2019s radiation balance, which involves either reducing the amount of sunlightthat reaches the Earth using space shades/mirrors, or increasing the proportion ofincident sunlight that is reflected back into space using stratospheric aerosols,tropospheric aerosols or changes in the land/ocean surface; and (ii) removal andstorage of atmospheric CO2, which involves capturing CO2 from the atmospherethrough ocean fertilisation (using iron addition or ocean pipes), marine-algaecultivation, electrochemically-induced increases in ocean alkalinity or \u0333air capture\u2018schemes (such as \u0333synthetic trees\u2018). \u201d\u201c104.i.b. Stratospheric aerosolsThis technique aims to cool the Earth\u2018s troposphere and surface by increasing thebackscattering of radiation in the stratosphere (which increases planetary albedo) using airborne sub-microscopic particles such as sulphate, metals, dielectrics, resonant scatterers or dust [A12].These aerosol particles would be created byreleasing aerosol precursors into the stratosphere. This could be done by: releasingprecursors at the Earth\u2018s surface and allowing them to be carried into thestratosphere; firing them into the stratosphere from the Earth\u2018s surface; or deliveringthem into the stratosphere using high-altitude balloons or aircraft [B2] (possibly byaddition to aviation fuel, which could reduce the cost of delivery [Q15]). Injectioncould either take place in the tropics (with the aim of obtaining global coverage) or inthe Arctic (with the aim of reducing warming in this region, which is particularlyvulnerable to anthropogenic climate change).There are a number of uncertainties about the potential impacts of these schemes onthe environment21,22. In particular, the effects of stratospheric aerosols on the climatesystem are not fully understood [AD4] \u2014 although they are known to affect circulationpatterns, stratospheric ozone concentrations (which affect climate) [AD2] and uppertropospheric cloud formation (a particular concern is that these schemes couldincrease the cover of high cirrus clouds in the tropics, which could increasewarming). Changes observed after volcanic eruptions (which can inject aerosols intothe stratosphere) suggest that the climatic response to stratospheric aerosol forcingis regionally variable [AD3]. In particular, they indicate that there may be significantdecreases in precipitation over land23 (which could lead to drought) and changes inthe North Atlantic Oscillation (which could lead to warmer winters over Eurasia) [B6].The potential impact of the schemes on ecosystems also remains uncertain, butaerosols can affect photosynthesis by increasing the amount of diffuse solar radiationand decreasing the amount of direct solar radiation [A14] and can causeenvironmental pollution. \u201chttp://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/climatechange/research/pdf/geo-engineering-0409.pdf\u2026what would it look like? Could you tell a dispersal of barium or aluminum apart from a \u201cnormal\u201d looking contrail?Maybe, maybe not.In any case, all the research that is forthcoming about their \u2018plans\u2019 points to things that are very likely underway already.Who says the government has EVER asked permission or disclosed top secret activities to the public before carrying them out?Who says they would inform you about it, or truthfully assure you that it wasn\u2019t being done? Have you received any such assurances from the government? Do share\u2026.Your arguments are the same as the cigarette companies\u2026.they forever denied that their product was harmful, in the face of the evidence, and to this day they won\u2019t admit any more than they have to\u2026..and it only took like 40 years of research to get where we\u2019re at with that!If somebody makes a claim, your modus operandi is to say \u201cif only you had pictures or video\u201d. If they produce pictures or video, you claim \u201cthat looks like contrails to me\u201d.You challenge our educational level, yet when we present testimony from expert individuals in the field of biological and atmospheric sciences, you claim they are misled and uninformed (such as you did with Dr. Hildegarde Staninger and Rosalie Bertrell PhD).You belittle the notion that there are any things going on, and you marginalize people who bring various pieces of the puzzle to the table.You claim that managing this site takes you 30 minutes a day, yet person after person expresses amazement at how you seem to be constantly present, all the while exclaiming \u2018bring me the evidence!\u2019, but not genuinely examining or juxtaposing the physical science that accompanies the scholarly white-papers that outline the very programs which may well be part of the crux of the whole \u2018Chemtrails\u2019 issue!You pretend to take all factors into account, but in reality you pick and choose your points, and carefully avoid others which you cannot easily explain away. Don\u2019t think myself and others can\u2019t see that.I\u2019m not here to make personal attacks, but only to perhaps draw attention to the manner in which you contribute to the debate.Are you really seeing the whole picture?Remain Vigilant! Stay Sovereign!SPUSAKamransays:July 30, 2009 at 3:43 pmThis theory seems especially silly since it goes something like this: There is an evil government plot to either poison people, save the world from global warming, or control the weather. This government plot allegedly involves spraying giant arrows across the sky pointing directly toward what it is they are doing. These trails do not appear every day so it doesn\u2019t seem like it is necessary that there needs to be consistent spraying to get results they want.But even if you grant these highly specious premises you are still left with the evil government going out of their way to attract attention by spraying during the day. Now it is one thing to believe in an government that is powerful and amazingly leak free, it contradicts reality but not itself. But believing that this water-tight organization is also grossly incompetent enough to put these giant arrows in the sky during broad daylight would tax my willing suspension of disbelief were this presented in a work of fiction.sovereignpatriotusasays:July 31, 2009 at 10:32 pmKamran,Um\u2026.did you READ the material I linked?

It\u2019s the temperature and humidity in the upper atmosphere, where contrails are formed, that determines when and if they are formed. It\u2019s the middle of summer right now. Feel free to hit this website and enter the hottest city in the US and scroll down for temperatures aloft, you may be surprised to find that at 30K feet it\u2019s below zero or close to it.http://www.usairnet.com/cgi-bin/Winds/Aloft.cgi?location=&Submit=Get+Forecast&hour=12&course=azimuthBy sovereignpatriotusa:\u201cNeither can it be explained as altostratus undulatus (rows of wavy clouds), because it storms after those formations\u201dThat\u2019s your reasoning for dismissing wave clouds as not being Altostratus Undulatus?

Why do you believe this.By sovereignpatriotusa:\u201cif the claim is that gusty wind blows contrails together to form \u2018X\u2019s and grid patterns, how is it that the contrail maintains its shape at all?\u201d\u2026\u201cIt seems highly unlikely that several contrails could all simultaneously hold their shape and alignment in the very conditions said to be responsible for their perfect grid-style convergence in ONE instance\u201dIf that were the claim, then you would be correct, but that isn\u2019t the claim at all. If conditions are right to form persistent contrails, grid patterns and X\u2019s are formed by flight paths crossing each other throughout the day. Those patterns (already formed) then drift across the sky just as clouds would.

All three of those formations are responsible for \u2018wavy parallel lines of cloud strips\u2019, and they usually proceed bad weather that doesn\u2019t manifest with quite a few of those \u2018persistent contrail\u2019 formations.And flight path? Many \u2018persistent contrail\u2019 formations have been observed to show up where there is little air traffic (according to Flightaware), with planes that are there only long enough to create the trails, and do not seem to be part of any \u2018regular route\u2019 traffic (according to eyewitness reports from knowledgeable individuals) .If temperature of day or night, season or weather made no difference at 30000 Ft., then wouldn\u2019t contrails persist all the time, every instance, from the beginning of jet history? Yet, MOST contrails should not persist, and if they did those \u2018persistent contrails\u2019 would not need to be designated \u2018occasional\u2019.Break it down for me. What % of time do contrails persist? What % of THOSE meet the right conditions to become \u2018cirrus like\u2019 clouds? And further, what % of THOSE stick around in the right place to be over-layered enough to create nearly perfect grid formations?The % keeps getting smaller and smaller, yet your use of this keeps increasing.Have conditions for persistent contrails increased enough to justify the frequency that \u2018persistent contrails\u2019 are witnessed? If so, how did this change in weather come about? Has \u2018global warming\u2019 caused an environment which supports longer persisting contrails?Does any of that even matter, in the face of the evidence regarding the propositions to release barium and aluminum into the atmosphere to assist EMF propagation, and to manage the climate?What if it all looks the same? If I gave you poison water that looks the same as pure water, would it mean that just because they appear similar it could be argued they are the same thing?JazzRocsays:August 1, 2009 at 1:40 pmSovpatUSA:Plus, if the claim is that gusty wind blows contrails together to form \u2018X\u2019s and grid patterns, how is it that the contrail maintains its shape at all? Have you ever seen any kind of smoke or vapor hold its shape perfectly when you start aggressively blowing on it?Science. It\u2019s the careful study of the natural world. Scientists reach out (in this case up) into the world and MEASURE it. For everyone\u2019s edification (and their own) they then PUBLISH their work so that it is available to all. Other scientists, and the lay public (but not \u201cchemtrailers\u201d) then may discover the parts of our world not immediately available to them.In the case of the upper atmosphere, it was discovered more than a hundred and twenty years ago, using balloons and dirigibles, that an invisible CHANGE took place in the atmosphere with increasing altitude, especially at a point scientists and atmospheric researchers called the TROPOPAUSE.It has been known for thousands of years (except by \u201cchemtrailers\u201d) that as one climbs a mountain the air temperature FALLS. It was naturally assumed that the air temperature, as one climbed higher and higher, would keep falling lower and lower, but to the surprise of scientists and researchers (but not \u201cchemtrailers\u201d, for of that they know nothing) about that point called thr tropopause temperaturesbegan to climb again!The air above that tropopause (or end of the troposphere, which is naturally warmer at its base, and therefore TURBULENT) we now call the stratosphere. Because the air there gets warmer with increasing altitude, it doesn\u2019t behave like tropospheric air at all (except in the case of \u201cinversions\u201d). It is STABLE, remaining in discrete layers which slide frictionlessly over each other. There are no \u201cgusts\u201d, there are no \u201cwinds\u201d, save that each \u201cslippery\u201d stratospheric layer is of itself a \u201cwind\u201d. But you might as well call each layer (and all stratospheric layers areinvisible) a \u201criver\u201d of air. If you have been a fireman you see this behaviour in the conflagration within a burning house: thehottestair is against the ceiling, and stratified layers of progressively-cooler smoky air lie smoothly and stably beneath it.Now I\u2019m taking a short while to educate you inreal truthright now in an attempt toshameyou into reading some science. It shouldn\u2019t be difficult to look a few things up, even for a fool, who faced with the lies and scams of the web believes them without a moment\u2019s hesitation. The web is before you.

Anything in the atmosphere in aerosol form will remain suspended for hours or days and will drift and be blown apart for hundreds or thousands of miles by wind. Not much use for a targeting assault. Any biological would not withstand the levels of UV rays in such a delivery, as UV easily disrupts genetic material.Also, a patent is proof only of ownership of a concept. It is not a determination that that concept has been produced, is feasible, or even works.

I hate sloppy journalism.JazzRocsays:August 1, 2009 at 5:44 pmSovpatUSA, the easy way to answer your questions would be to suggest \u201cWhatever you have in your mind, just think the reverse.\u201dThis is because you are not working from a scientific basis. Seeing as you are contending in the \u201cboxing ring\u201d of science (\u201cContrail Science\u201d \u2013 remember?), you\u2019ll pardon me (I hope) when I sling you a few left hooks and uppercuts:All three of those formations are responsible for \u2018wavy parallel lines of cloud strips\u2019, and they usually proceed bad weather that doesn\u2019t manifest with quite a few of those \u2018persistent contrail\u2019 formations.\u2013 The former are in thetroposphere. Contrails are in thestratosphere. Thetropopauseseparates them. This separation of the two \u201cspheres\u201d is blatantly obvious in the \u2018anvil\u2019 of a cumulonimbus: above its flat top IS the stratosphere.Many \u2018persistent contrail\u2019 formations have been observed to show up where there is little air traffic (according to Flightaware), with planes that are there only long enough to create the trails, and do not seem to be part of any \u2018regular route\u2019 traffic (according to eyewitness reports from knowledgeable individuals).\u2013 Persistent contrails can last all day. The average speed of the stratosphere is 50mph, so you may see a persistent trail 400 MILES away from where it was formed.If temperature of day or night, season or weather made no difference at 30,000 ft, then wouldn\u2019t contrails persist all the time, every instance, from the beginning of jet history?\u2013 HUMIDITY is the controlling factor (more accurately vapor pressure). Humid air and dry air are EQUALLY TRANSPARENT. Humidity varies from layer to layer, and typically also up- and down-wind inside any particular layer. That\u2019s what makes for the typically unpredictable consequences of aviation contrails.Yet MOST contrails should not persist, and if they did those \u2018persistent contrails\u2019 would not need to be designated \u2018occasional\u2019.\u2013 Most contrails do NOT persist.What % of time do contrails persist?\u2013 The last figures I saw (in a 1992 report) were that persistence occurred 17% of the time. That percentage would have increased since then.What % of THOSE meet the right conditions to become \u2018cirrus like\u2019 clouds?\u2013 That would depend on the wetness or dryness of the layer beneath the layer they were formed in. That\u2019s a little hard to say. I don\u2019t know.And further, what % of THOSE stick around in the right place to be over-layered enough to create nearly perfect grid formations?\u2013 That normally happens with crossing shuttle routes. If two hourly routes cross at right angles, then you\u2019ll get another \u201ccross\u201d on the hour, won\u2019t you?The % keeps getting smaller and smaller, yet your use of this keeps increasing.\u2013 Air travel (and fuel use, and trail deposition) has increased fifty times since the fifties, the increase being exponential. Daily a MILLION TONS of trail ICE (which is what it is) has a 17% (or greater) capability of entraining into persistent trails something like a further TWO THOUSAND MILLION TONS of precipitated ICE (from supersaturated water vapor in a stratospheric layer). Seeing as the initially precipitated ice has a size the same order as cigarette smoke, it\u2019s possible to turn skies white, don\u2019t you think. (Of course this is only a phenomenon close to you: from a satellite one can see stripes, but thewhole Earthisn\u2019t turned white.Have conditions for persistent contrails increased enough to justify the frequency that \u2018persistent contrails\u2019 are witnessed?\u2013 Yes.If so, how did this change in weather come about?Increase in air traffic. Ice crystal fallout is (nearly) the ONLY mechanism the Earth has for removing water from the stratosphere.Has \u2018global warming\u2019 caused an environment which supports longer persisting contrails?\u2013 No.Does any of that even matter, in the face of the evidence regarding the propositions to release barium and aluminum into the atmosphere to assist EMF propagation, and to manage the climate?\u2013 Propositions evidencenothing. Visit a patent office.What if it all looks the same?\u2013 It doesn\u2019t.BARIUM products would turn jet exhaust GREEN. (Used in green fireworks.) It would also stop the gas turbine.ALUMINUM products would turn jet exhaust WHITE AND CRACKLY. (Used in THERMITE.) ALUMINA would grind down the pumps and jets and blades of a gas turbine. (Used as an abrasive.)MORGELLONS would be BURNT in a gas turbine flame \u2013 it would be just another fuel.Go and read a science book, as found in a library.jdcobra65says:August 1, 2009 at 11:42 pmchemtrails and the HAARP site work together\u2026ask TESLA\u2026well he\u2019s dead but his work and patents are in the hands of the new world order\u2026who are playing with the world as if it were a game of RISK.

All three of those formations are responsible for \u2018wavy parallel lines of cloud strips\u2019, and they usually proceed bad weather that doesn\u2019t manifest with quite a few of those \u2018persistent contrail\u2019 formations.I\u2019m having trouble understanding what your point is in that last sentence. If those cloud formations are responsible for wavy clouds and they preceed bad weather (not all of them do), what does that have to do with persistent contrails? In a lot of cases, conditions for persistent contrails do preceed bad weather and\u2026if wavy clouds preceed bad weather\u2026doesn\u2019t that back up the \u201cpersistent contrail\u201d theory? I may be way off base with the point you\u2019re trying to make, if so I apologize.By sovereignpatriotusa-And flight path? Many \u2018persistent contrail\u2019 formations have been observed to show up where there is little air traffic (according to Flightaware), with planes that are there only long enough to create the trails, and do not seem to be part of any \u2018regular route\u2019 traffic (according to eyewitness reports from knowledgeable individuals) .People underestimate the amount of air traffic above their head, until conditions are right for persistent contrals\u2026because they leave a trail that stays all day long. You never hear people say \u201cI had 8 jets pass over my house and didn\u2019t leave any trails\u201d, because you can\u2019t see those jets without using a flight tracker\u2026and of course where\u2019s the conspiracy in that.By sovereignpatriotusa-If temperature of day or night, season or weather made no difference at 30000 Ft., then wouldn\u2019t contrails persist all the time, every instance, from the beginning of jet history? Yet, MOST contrails should not persist, and if they did those \u2018persistent contrails\u2019 would not need to be designated \u2018occasional\u2019.No, because there are a lot of factors that contribute the the formation of a persistent contrail. Are these factors \u201crare\u201d? Not at all, especially not when conditions in one particular area are right for them. It\u2019s when conditions are right people see high numbers of persistent contrails, referred to by chemtrailers as \u201cspray days\u201d. But I also read on chemtrailcentral about stretches where there is \u201cno spraying\u201d and they finally have blue skies and puffy \u201cnatrual\u201d clouds, so even by chemtrailer standards, they could also be called occasional.By sovereignpatriotusa-Break it down for me. What % of time do contrails persist? What % of THOSE meet the right conditions to become \u2018cirrus like\u2019 clouds? And further, what % of THOSE stick around in the right place to be over-layered enough to create nearly perfect grid formations?The % keeps getting smaller and smaller, yet your use of this keeps increasing.You questions aren\u2019t reasonable in that there are so many factors present in creating those conditions that it would be virtually impossible to track that data down to even vague percentages. The reason being, it\u2019s all completely based on the right atmospheric conditions (temp/humidity), the location of the plane in relation to those conditions (altitude, longitude, latitude), the of the plane\u2019s engines (less powerful engines leave a smaller contrail footprint), the weight of the airplane itself (heavier planes use more thrust than lighter planes). The only thing even remotely predictible in this convoluted mess of random events is the location of the non-directional beacons, which commercial airliners use to navigate the skies. But even that it doesn\u2019t take into account the random intersection of airplanes paths between beacons.I\u2019m sure that a location like Florida, coastal and gulf states are more prone to contrail formation because of the humidity in the air. And flyover states are prone to contrail formation because of the sheer number of planes flying at high altitude back and forth across the country. But I\u2019m no meteorologist and to be honest I don\u2019t really care enough to spend hours researching that information.By sovereignpatriotusa-Have conditions for persistent contrails increased enough to justify the frequency that \u2018persistent contrails\u2019 are witnessed? If so, how did this change in weather come about? Has \u2018global warming\u2019 caused an environment which supports longer persisting contrails?Yes, but I don\u2019t believe that the atmosphere changed that much, it\u2019s more likely WE changed. Airplanes of today are designed to carry more passengers than they did 10, 20 or 30 years ago. Their engines are much more powerful and they are much heavier\u2026not to mention that overall there are more planes in the sky now than there ever were. These factors alone are enough to considerably increase the frequency of persistent contrails.By sovereignpatriotusa-Does any of that even matter, in the face of the evidence regarding the propositions to release barium and aluminum into the atmosphere to assist EMF propagation, and to manage the climate?Not really. Even if everything you say is true, what are the people of the world going to do? Rise up? Revolt against the Government? Why participate in a witch hunt based on a belief without facts? If there are facts, then I am certainly willing to change my mind, but I don\u2019t see anything beyond speculation and rumor.By sovereignpatriotusa-What if it all looks the same? If I gave you poison water that looks the same as pure water, would it mean that just because they appear similar it could be argued they are the same thing?How do you know it\u2019s poison? I\u2019d be stupid to drink poison even if it looks like water\u2026but you do not KNOW that it (\u201cchemtrails\u201d) are poison. There are no physical tests that have been done that you are willing to accept.So\u2026if no physical tests apply to your statement, how can you be sure that it isn\u2019t water (persistent contrail)?I am not saying that it is IMPOSSIBLE that persistent contrails aren\u2019t \u201cchemtrails\u201d, but current evidence for them is very strongly against it. If some other evidence comes to light that sheds doubt on my beliefs, I\u2019ll certainly consider it and reassess my belief.JazzRocsays:August 2, 2009 at 1:39 pmjdcobra:\u2026ask TESLA\u2026well he\u2019s deadSet me up for the day! \ud83d\ude00Suntoursays:August 2, 2009 at 7:08 pmBy jdcobra65 \u2013 \u201cCHEMTRAILS are REAL\u2026ask the folks in the UK\u2026 their GOVERNMENT got caught spraying chemtrails\u201dI missed that, where can I find info on that?By jdcobra65 \u2013 \u201cask the WHO about chemtrails\u2026ask the UNITED NATIONS \u2026they started this chemical war after germany failed, with hitler\u2026.\u201dAre you convinced that they\u2019ll tell us the truth?

My,After reading through all this i am quite exhausted, Uncinus i detected became quite ruffled by post 27.Good people you are part of the way on the right path.Uncinus (Mick)says:August 11, 2009 at 3:06 amNot ruffled exactly, just rather dissapointed that people tend to wander off topic. The only thing that will bring clarity to the subject is looking at the evidence with a scientific eye. Have contrails unexpectedly changed? Is there anything in them that is being added deliberately? Is it causing any effect? These are all questions that can be answered to a high degree of certainty by examining the evidence. If there was an effect, it would be measurable. If they have changed, then they would be different to how they were before.But when faced with the evidence that contrails have NOT changed, and that there is NOTHING unusual in them, and that there has been NO unexplained measurable effect attributable to contrails, then the theorists simply revert back to a more general theory of \u201cthere\u2019s a secret government, weather modification and HAARP exist, hence the chemtrail theory must be correct\u201d.So, I suggest, to move the discussion along, yes, let\u2019s assume all the first part of that, assume that there is a secret government, and a secret weather modification program, and a secret use of HAARP, then now explain, with actual science, what evidence is there that contrails are involved.Nobody can.Crystalsays:August 11, 2009 at 6:55 amHi,You say you must have actual Science, well my friend science doesn\u2019t cover everything, i should know.Like some scientists you have to think and look outside of the box.When your stuck in the box your looking but you do not see, your listening but not hearing.People are getting frustrated as their similar witness accounts our not being noted.They are not talking about the odd couple of contrails but observation of substantial saturation and making notes of the weather change that happen around these times.Change in vegetation and wildlife.There are others watching on health activities.In the 70\u2019s it was common knowledge amongst certain people including myself that experiments were taking place using clouds.When the questions came, the projects involved had to give out false information with blatant inconsistencies.Were the public privy, NO.Were they aware,NO.Did it do any damage,YESNothing is straight forward and thats how it is made to be.There are two outcomes going on.JazzRocsays:August 11, 2009 at 2:16 pmCrystal:science doesn\u2019t cover everythingNo. Justreality.Had you noticed that the gun that shoots you in time of war has been scientifically-designed?

[I remember it looking like a long white ribbon being dragged behind the jetliner]3) persistent contrail with no spreading. [It would stretch horizon to horizon and then over time become a wriggly line and then evaporate]4) persistent contrail with spreading. [I remember referring to it as \u201cthe trail turning into a cloud\u201d]Of course childhood memories are unreliable.I also distinctly remember it always being sunny with blue skies and white cotton-ball clouds.Which is highly unlikely as I grew up in the rain-soaked North of England.I find it bizarre that people, even when presented with irrefutable contradicting evidence, will cling to a conspiracy theory.[Which should more accurately be called a \u201cconspiracy hypothesis\u201d.]sovereignpatriotusasays:August 18, 2009 at 12:14 pmHere is an update coming out of \u2018Time Magazine\u2019 entitled \u201cCan Geoengineering Help Slow Global Warming?\u201d.http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1916965,00.htmlRemember, none of these individual pieces tell the whole story, but create a \u2018forensic wall\u2019 where you can put all the pieces up for how they work together, and you can see for yourself what\u2019s going on.Lots of projects are easy to deny, with the parts so compartmentalized, with participants obligated to non-disclosure agreements, with professional pressures to maintain the status quo.It\u2019s a good thing that citizen activists are taking up an interest in the subject, so that the correct exposing of environmental, atmospheric, and electromagnetic operations being conducted can be accomplished.See an updated version of \u2018CHEMA-KILL\u2019, a documentary covering a wide range of topics relating to \u2018geoengineering\u2019, weather warfare, and much much more.http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=05377FA7DC26F81ERemain Vigilant!

Why do you jump to such conclusions without any reason to do so?Well, perhaps it is the dozen military and scientific programs which explicitly describe spraying stuff from planes, mixing with the fuel, etc\u2026If you had any sense, brain, or observatory skills, you would have noticed those links on this or a few other of the pages here.Since you are apparently intellectually deficient, I will repost a couple snippits and make it easy for you.\u201c\u201cGeo-engineering, defined here as intentional large-scale manipulation of the globalenvironment, has been suggested as a means of mitigating the effects ofanthropogenic greenhouse-gas emissions on climate, without necessarily reducingemissions. \u201d\u201cA number of geo-engineering options for mitigating the effects of anthropogenicgreenhouse-gas emissions on climate have been proposed. In this paper, weconsider a number of proposals, under two main headings: (i) alteration of theEarth\u2019s radiation balance, which involves either reducing the amount of sunlightthat reaches the Earth using space shades/mirrors, or increasing the proportion ofincident sunlight that is reflected back into space using stratospheric aerosols,tropospheric aerosols or changes in the land/ocean surface; and (ii) removal andstorage of atmospheric CO2, which involves capturing CO2 from the atmospherethrough ocean fertilisation (using iron addition or ocean pipes), marine-algaecultivation, electrochemically-induced increases in ocean alkalinity or \u0333air capture\u2018schemes (such as \u0333synthetic trees\u2018). \u201d\u201cThese aerosol particles would be created byreleasing aerosol precursors into the stratosphere. This could be done by: releasingprecursors at the Earth\u2018s surface and allowing them to be carried into thestratosphere; firing them into the stratosphere from the Earth\u2018s surface; or deliveringthem into the stratosphere using high-altitude balloons or aircraft [B2] (possibly byaddition to aviation fuel, which could reduce the cost of delivery [Q15]). Injectioncould either take place in the tropics (with the aim of obtaining global coverage) or inthe Arctic (with the aim of reducing warming in this region, which is particularlyvulnerable to anthropogenic climate change).\u201dAdditionally, other military programs outline the use of barium oxide and aluminum oxide for propagating EMF waves. If you read the Eastland patent (found here or at another website of your choicehttp://www.patentstorm.us/patents/4686605.html) then you would be aware of this being \u2018proposed\u2019 over 20 years ago.There is much more, but not sure if your attention span or brain capacity can handle it. How about you do some real homework before you talk out of turn. Super!Remain Vigilant!

And what makes you sure that what you read about geoengineering is happening above you? Who told you that when they \u201cgeoengineer\u201d there will be long white lines in the sky? No one told you to link the two things together\u2026you just ASSUME you should. Hilarious.You have this ridiculous blurb, but no logical link to the trails in the sky.Sorry, there is NO EVIDENCE that geoengineering would even be visible to the naked eye! And there is CERTAINLY no reason for them to \u201cspray chemicals\u201d through the jet engines, where these trails obviously originate. The conclusion jumping you people do is just pathetic. I don\u2019t expect you to understand why, you are obviously uneducated. I would appreciate it if you could direct me to ANY source of evidence that states as FACT that geoengineering results in lines in the sky. I have news for you\u2026and this will really scare you chemtards, when they DO \u201cspray\u201d (it\u2019s more like release, not spray) into the air as part of weather control, it\u2019s not visible from the ground with the naked eye. It certainly looks nothing like persistent contrails. Prove me wrong.Shilltasticsays:August 28, 2009 at 3:33 pmAlso, do you live in the Tropics or the Arctic? I sure don\u2019t and I see persistent contrails (what the ignorant call \u201cchemtrails\u201d) all the time, just as I have for over 40 years. If your cute little blurb had ANY value, it would apply only to the trails in regions where \u201cgeoengineering\u201d would be helpful (as stated in your useless quote) . Not EVERYWHERE.I sure do wish you people would try to learn about aviation/meteorology from reliable sources with peer reviewed information instead of accepting useless crap form OTHER ignorant simpletons as \u201cfact\u201d. You are doing yourself such a disservice by believing everything you read/see on the Internet/youtube simply because it mirrors your OWN misguided beliefs.Chemtards are the funniest people on the planet.It\u2019s also funny that geoengineering is NOT a secret, and never has been to those of us who have studied aviation, yet so many uneducated \u201cpeople\u201d think it\u2019s part of a \u201cgovernment plot\u201d (LOL) against them. Paranoia is a real illness\u2026seek help.Shilltasticsays:August 29, 2009 at 4:38 am\u201cThere is much more, but not sure if your attention span or brain capacity can handle it. How about you do some real homework before you talk out of turn. Super!\u201dYes, there IS so much more information out there. But, only the uneducated chemtards link that info to the lines in the sky. I have a great attention span! In fact, I spent 40+ years learning about aviation and the atmosphere while you were busy looking at your shoes and eating your boogers. You REALLY should have paid attention in science class. In fact, you shouldn\u2019t have dropped out of school in the 3rd grade. Had you stayed and paid some attention, you would understand how the scientific method and peer reviewed information is CRITICAL in forming an opinion in matters of science. YOU just seem to think one should be able to make ridiculous assumptions and then claim it to be \u201cfact\u201d.Fact MATTERS in discussions about science and you have ZERO facts on your side. You have paranoid speculation and assumption\u2026nothing more! I know that last sentence is lost on you. You just don\u2019t understand the importance of actual scientific research. No, what you do is NOT research. What you do is take info and jam it all together and form and OPINION in your mind. Sorry, that\u2019s not how things work and only an uneducated simpleton (chemtard) would believe otherwise.Also, where did I \u201ctalk\u201d \u201cout of turn\u201d?! This is a PUBLIC FORUM and I don\u2019t need to ask permission or wait to be invited into the discussion. Are you an American?!? And you pull THAT shit?! PATHETIC!sovereignpatriotusasays:August 29, 2009 at 8:41 amIn \u2018out of turn\u2019, I was implying that you were running to back up your debunking claim with nothing except denials and assertions of authority for \u201940 years\u2019 of aviation involvement.Of course, all opinions should be put on the table, and I should not have allowed myself to make snide comments.I am just so very frustrated with all you \u2018debunkers\u2019 claiming that \u2018chemtards\u2019 are conspiracy idiots with baseless accusations composed of ill-fitting pieces derived from random internet clips.Which is not at all the case.What\u2019s really sad, is that there are so many people out there who really believe that the government is NOT up to any sort of undisclosed programs (I\u2019m sure you get a classified briefing every morning right?), that they DON\u2019T have any solid provable history of experimentation on citizens, and that nothing is ever wrong in smallsville.If you want to turn a blind eye to everything, then claim you didn\u2019t see anything, I suppose you can be right in your own way. That\u2019s your right as an American.Shilltasticsays:August 29, 2009 at 10:24 am\u201cI am just so very frustrated with all you \u2018debunkers\u2019 claiming that \u2018chemtards\u2019 are conspiracy idiots with baseless accusations composed of ill-fitting pieces derived from random internet clips.Which is not at all the case.\u201dIt sure IS!Until a trail is tested and shown to be part of any of the countless ridiculous hypotheses that are polluting the internet, they are PERSISTENT CONTRAILS. There is no reason to believe anything else unless one is paranoid. Science EASILY explains EVERY pathetic misunderstanding that every chemtard has. The chemtards are just too ignorant and lazy to even TRY to prove themselves wrong. You (they) jump to conclusions and foolishly believe them as fact even though I have YET to meet a chemtard who has taken the time to even TRY to understand the facts. I find it DISGUSTING that so many people (chemtards) believe they actually understand the complex nature of the atmosphere, and how a jet engine behaves within it, without EVER having stepped in a classroom where someone TRAINED to teach others can properly explain things to them. To be a chemtard is to admit that one is lazy and ignorant. There is just no getting around that fact. I also find it HILARIOUS when chemtards come to this site and \u201ctry\u201d to refute the 100% verifiable information within it. NOTHING on this site is just made up or assumed (except the drivel that the chemtards post) yet, you people couldn\u2019t be bothered to confirm any of it. You reject it outright and replace it with science fiction fantasy and paranoia. I truly am disgusted by chemtards and that is why I spend my time TRYING to help them. Again, verifiable fact FAR outweighs supposition, assumption and speculation.I turn a blind eye to NOTHING. I have read/watched countless hours of information that the chemtards have posted and see NO REASON to believe my knowledge of persistent contrails needs to be tweaked. You can come up with a BILLION theories as to what these trails are, but to refute what science says they are, you need proof\u2026There is NO PROOF that any line, partial line, pattern, shape that has come out of a jet engine is ANYTHING but a contrail. Do you understand the word proof and how important it is in this case? You people are accusing so many people of doing something, yet you have NOTHING (other than some random internet based CRAP) that PROVES it. It\u2019s insane. I hope one of you chemtards wins the lottery someday and hires an independent company to sample/test a trail. Hey, that\u2019s not a bad idea\u2026someone should start a website asking for donation to do just that! I know I\u2019d contribute a hundred bucks or so if it meant that all the chemtards would have to eat their ridiculous words!JazzRocsays:August 30, 2009 at 9:07 amShilltastic:Hey, that\u2019s not a bad idea\u2026someone should start a website asking for donation to do just that!

I would pay ANY price to clear the names of the maligned aviation industry professionals. Then again, the chemtards do provide me with endless laughter. I\u2019m torn!bybssays:September 8, 2009 at 1:49 amWell folks, you can laugh at \u2018chemtards\u2019 as you call them, but if you took a little time off from your study of high-altitude aeronautics to study history, you would learn that those who rule have precious little compassion for the likes of us, and this has led in the past (\u2018history\u2019) and in the present (\u2018current events\u2019) to acts of absolute evil, hidden under the cloak offered by power. So\u2026it is not so unlikely to my mind (absolute scientific proof -with all due respects- is for those who are so alienated from their bodies that they do not trust the alignment of their reason and observation with the feeling in their gut) that \u2018the government\u2019 (i.e. the military) has, does and will reproduce tests with airplanes in which chemicals are sprayed. But I suspect that ours is a deeper rift. Just as you do not believe in the possibility of chemtrails (and hence danger of these to yourself) you probably also disparage those of us who believe that the moon landing was an elaborate cold-war hoax, or that Haarp is designed to manipulate weather as a weapon. And the reason that people like you believe the \u2018official story\u2019 (as opposed to the real story) is that you do not properly understand the nature of POWER and how it has always, and always will make things up in order to stay in power. Our ancestors called the root of this tendency \u2018satan\u2019 \u2018the father of all lies\u2019, but even the book in which these words are taken (\u2018the Bible\u2019) has been distorted in order to serve the political needs of those who would grasp and keep power over others. The children of Satan, to those in power (\u2018Christians\u2019 lol) are those who questions the official story, offering \u2018lies\u2019 that \u2018corrupt\u2019 the good, hardworking, earnest and healthy American People. It is truly sad to witness the denial which people have to go through in order to prop up a vast charade because living without it seems too scary. It is sad, and it will become dangerous, because in order to defend what is \u2018good and wholesome\u2019 witch hunts must be undertaken whereby those who seriously challenge the \u2018official story\u2019 will be dealt with, surprise, with very little compassion. I know everybody wants to believe the official story, but wanting to believe does not make it so. Sure, the \u2018conspiracy theorists\u2019 are a mixed bag of various levels of thought and understanding, but at least they have the sense to smell that \u2018something stinks in Denmark\u2019 All of our puzzle pieces do not amount to science, but neither do we think that they need to. Gleaned from comparative history old and new, from the coincidences and gaps in the official story, from our own observations and feeling about human nature and the nature of politics and power, all of these puzzle pieces are coming together, and chemtrail theory is not necessary for such a picture to make absolute sense, given our study of history, if not \u2018science\u2019. Let me suggest that you stop worshipping science and recognize that the history of the will to power is also a reasonable subject of study, and one which might give you a fresh view of things. Let me also suggest that feelings are not nothing, and that maybe you should get in touch instead of pushing away in the attempt to get at \u2018pure science\u2019. That said, I like your site and have spent way too much time reading the back and forth between you, your team of yes-men and the chemtards, who are, like you, just trying to help you see something.JazzRocsays:September 8, 2009 at 6:09 ambybs:Well folks see something.We gather\u2026As your egg-sucking grand-daddy, who hasbothstudied hard and passed my exams in schoolandtken taken and passed degree courses inbothscienceandthe arts, AND lived a professional career asbothan engineerandan artist, let me tell you a couple of things:Science is put together logically using achainof evidence. Abreakin the chain is itsdisproof. In the \u201cchemtrail\u201d case this break occurs AT the aircraft. The trails are made by passenger aviation (despite CT claims to the contrary) \u2013 and there is NO feature in a passenger aircraft like a tank or spray equipment. The trails are made by the engines. Thegapin the trail shows NO additive. Ergo NO CHEMTRAIL.HAARP is a device for heating the ionosphere which applies less energy per unit area than the Sun normally does. The ionosphere is closer to a vacuum than can be normally achieved in a laboratory. Altering the appearance of the ionosphere (which the Sun does to create the Aurora Borealis) has the effect on the rest of us which the Sun has: NOTHING.I always thought Chicken Little was a stupid fairy story. Who would believe a delusory idiot chicken? Even for a moment?After all, it\u2019syoung. Andstupid.sawitsays:September 14, 2009 at 11:22 pmChemtrails are real.Its all part of the New World Order.

Yeah, I should give up on science to accept the word of the uneducated as fact.Shilltasticsays:September 21, 2009 at 5:36 pmIt amazes me how many people think the \u201cHistory Channel, That\u2019s Impossible, Weather Warfare\u201d is a documentary based on \u201cfacts\u201d. They see this mockumentary and automatically assume that their beliefs are now justified because the \u201cfacts\u201d are now on mainstream TV. It\u2019s just so sad! Has anyone seen the \u201ctruthergirls\u201d channel/videos on youtube? It\u2019s absolutely frightening to me how many people will ABUSE the word \u201ctruth\u201d in their screen names and then piss all over the concept of truth itself. The funny thing is, if they just paid attention to the wording of the \u201cdocumentary\u201d they would understand the intent a bit more. \u201csome researchers believe\u2026.\u201d is one of the best lines\u2026.Everyone on youtube believes themselves to be \u201cresearchers\u201d yet they conveniently IGNORE basic principles of aviation and meteorology in their \u201cresearch\u201d. It\u2019s hilarious and sad at the same time. It\u2019s obvious that those of us who understand will NEVER be able to convince those who are ignorant of the facts that there is no such thing as \u201cchemtrails\u201d. Why do we bother? Because we have a MORAL responsibility to help our fellow man. I don\u2019t care if they accept the truth or not. I will continue to express it! The wonderful people in the aviation/meteorology industries deserve MUCH better treatment than they get from these ignorant simpletons!Carlson,Vsays:January 16, 2010 at 4:23 pmI will tell you, our Government is corrupt, evil, full of lies and deciept, and has been going on long enough for it to get way to big and needs to be brought down and start anew. I know for sure they have been manipulating our weather for years, as well as stealing and miss using our money. Our Government is so evil that if you study deep into this you would know that they are evil enough to have created multiple devastations around the globe as well as the most recent with Haiti. People better be scared if they are not already, and we can only hope they do not pass any health care bill, or we can kiss our a** goodbye, there is nothing good out of what we can\u2019t see in plain site just as the sonic explosions that have happened globaly for years creating earthquake\u2019s and much more, trust that you should be scared because this is only the begining of much more horrific things to come here in our near future if the people do not come together and put an end to all of this and save our planet, our beloved USA and Constitution.JazzRocsays:January 17, 2010 at 3:50 amCarlson,V, there was nothing either correct or even relevant in your post.Put \u201can end to all of this and save your planet, your beloved USA and Constitution\u201d, by educating yourself in science, logic, and reason, drawing no more of the planet\u2019s resources, putting an end to your own lies and self-deception, and becoming self-sufficient.Msays:January 25, 2010 at 7:37 pmThey say verbatim: \u201cwe spray our enemies\u201d!

Nor can you argue with it these days, unless you possess your own orbital satellite with state-of-the-art laser tools and have gone and got yourself a whole new set of facts and figures, and some remarkable and new interpretation.Atmospheric Physics is a realm of FACTS and FIGURES, and advancing arguments for analytical tools and interpretive techniques, which is approaching a century in age.Within its aegis, contrails of all recorded types have been logged, measured, assayed, and understood.

I will defend it against lies based on paranoid ignorance until the day I die.There are no chemicals\u2026.if someone shows me that I\u2019m wrong, then I will change my stance, and become a chemtrail cultist myself. YOU people SHOULD require much more evidence before you jump on a bandwagon. I can\u2019t understand why so many people accept this \u201cchemtrail\u201d stuff as \u201cfact\u201d without the slightest bit of evidence.Yes, I understand that you\u2019ve seen the trails and read/watched all sorts of \u201ctruths\u201d about them on rense.com and youtube. But, the fact remains, there is no evidence of ANY chemicals in the trails other than combustion gases and water vapor. If I were you, I would focus more on the billions of sources of pollution you ignore at ground level. There are far more dangerous chemicals in the air in and around your home that you are completely unaware of that DON\u2019T come from airplanes.Uncinus (Mick)says:March 15, 2010 at 8:30 pmIt\u2019s amazing how easy it is to get people to conform against their own beliefs. Right Uncinus?Well, I don\u2019t seem to be doing very well with the chemtrail theorists, do I? They just get angry and go away. None of them have conformed yet!I just run this site for fun. I like science, clouds, flying, and conspiracy theory \u2013 so I write about it.Anonymoussays:March 24, 2010 at 4:06 pmwell 4 your consideration,and peace of mind ,my brother worked in a lab filling tanks for ehemm the \u201cbritish intelligence\u201dlate 70s early80s and they were been attached to planes in luton airport.he said if you want to keep somthing secret do it in plain view,so thats more enough 4 me .Anonymoussays:March 25, 2010 at 2:46 pmby the way jazz roc that anomynous who was talkin bout aschs was not meAnonymoussays:May 1, 2010 at 8:58 amI watched the show and was disappointed to see so much theory. Even more disappointed at the usage of stock footage of USAAF B-17s trying to land/takeoff to resemble \u2018British\u2019 jets. Poor usage of clips that do not relate to the story trying to be presented.The History channel is slowly becoming the \u201cWhatever we want to say happened in the past\u201d Channel.JazzRocsays:May 1, 2010 at 3:53 pmAnon:that anomynous who was talkin bout aschs was not meAh.

Either A: WE ARE BEING POSIONED. or B: The government needs to do something about all planes that are creating contrails that last this long. You can watch various jets and planes fly by at all sorts of altitudes and they don\u2019t leave ones that last for HOURS and expand and make our skies look like polluted crap! So either way they are an issue. You are an idiot if you think it doesn\u2019t matter, I am sick of looking up at the heavens and seeing the disgusting trails of human existence polluting the natural beauty! Either way it\u2019s bullshit and totally preventable. So contrail or chemtrail who gives a shit they need to stop! If they have to linger longer than 15 minutes then they should be banned from the skies. If you disagree with this you opinion doesn\u2019t matter because you are such an idiot you can\u2019t even appreciate the beauty of natural clouds and the blue sky.Comments navigationNewer commentsComments are closed.** **Comments navigation** Leesays:July 25, 2009 at 10:01 pmYeah this show is a joke and there is no proof of anything here. The History channel is anything but historical but that\u2019s just typical government propaganda for you. I\u2019ve commented here before and I just have to say this. You always talk about the \u201csecret government\u201d like you think that things like that are not happening. Maybe you might want to stop looking at clouds for 5 minutes and see what\u2019s going on on the ground. While they steal your wealth and control your media they use advanced mind control to manipulate people. This media bomb puts Chemtrails in the mainstream which is totally counter revolutionary. That\u2019s why they do it! They LOVE to stoke those flames because it keeps peoples eyes off their dirty dealings. They control the meda 100% and so if anything this little gem should debunk Chemtrails before it ever validates them. But alot of people are pretty stupid! They don\u2019t get it even when they know not to trust the media. They just pick and choose when it suits their agenda. They can\u2019t see how they are being bitch slapped by their own conspiracy.The FED is your government trying to pass the reigns to the IMF. Bilderberg and the CFR control the media so this doesn\u2019t get on TV unless they say so. All nations are being bought and sold by multi-national corporations and banks behind the scenes. So stop with your tying Chemtrail/Contrail whatever with the FACT that there is a \u201csecret government\u201d globalizing everything right now.

It has no definite shape. It looks like cloud vapor. It looks smeared and a little dirty. It does not resemble any naturally occurring cloud. It has no edges, but looks like something blurry hanging incongruously high up in the air.It is not fog. It is not rising up out of the mountains. It is not one of the first clouds that regularly appear over the mountains early in the day, which mean it will later rain as the clouds quickly roll in from the desert and gather over the mountains, eventually producing a monsoon. All these things are very familiar to anyone who lives here.Again, it is high in the sky \u2014 which is otherwise perfectly clear.Within ten minutes, the smear has grown to triple its original size. It has simply expanded in all directions, but remains fuzzy, undefined, murky looking. It is now a very large suspended glob in the middle of the sky.The glob then proceeds to literally EJECT cloud vapor.The cloud vapor comes POURING out of the glob in the sky, heading East, in a sheet.The cloud vapor spreads rapidly across the sky \u2014 emanating completely from the amorphous blob, which is now very big, maybe six or seven times its original size, or larger.So now, we have a huge amorphous blob of murky vapor, from which is pouring a thin sheet of white vapor, extended like an arm across the sky.The people who have parked their cars to watch this occurrence now see a few white jets appear.As they fly by, long white trails extend from the plane, and within about five minutes, nine parallel lines have been laid out alongside and within the long sheet of vapor extending from the original blob.Finally one of the planes lays one extremely long trail across all the other parallel trails \u2014 almost as if sowing them together.Then the planes disappear, and the blob ceases to produce any more vapor.All the vapor in the sky lingers for the rest of the day.If this is a natural occurrence, please tell me what it was. I have never seen anything like it in my life. Hello, I have a question for whomever is in charge of this website. Please explain one phenomenon I just witnessed, if you would.

Surely you are not that naive. checkthemapsays:July 28, 2009 at 6:15 pmFirst, SR1419 . . .No, I am not naive. A lot of other things, maybe, but not naive.Of course the rich and powerful compete, that isn\u2019t at issue. But when do they not compete? They don\u2019t compete when they are working together to keep everyone else down.It\u2019s like the two supposed political parties in the US. They differ on many issues, often more than intheory than in practice, but on some levels they are definitely separate parties. But look at how often they cross all party lines to work together to further the interests of who? The wealthy and powerful.Foreign policy, economic globalization, the War on Drugs and Terror and whatever else, the increase in prisons and the prison population \u2014 this has all continued along pretty much the same lines for a long time, regardless of the party in power, who controls Congress.The powerful seem to play good cop, bad cop a lot \u2014 the Democrats are sort of the nicer cop who might get you an extra blanket for the cold night in your cell \u2014 the Republicans are the cops who will beat your head in with a gun butt \u2014 but in the end, it\u2019s the same prison, and you\u2019re still not the one in charge.Like George W. Bush said \u2014 on camera \u2014 the \u201celites\u201d are his base.Well, they\u2019re Obama\u2019s base too, and every other politician. The rest of the people are simply appeased and entertained as much as possible, until they have to be tasered.Anyway.Yes, the rich and powerful compete \u2014 they also kill each other and destroy each other\u2019s empires \u2014 but if the rabble start to really rise up, they will align to put them down however they can.Whereas the Communists just tried to harness the energy of the rabble to destroy their own enemies . . .But I\u2019m digressing.And I\u2019m sure you get my point.When I say the rich and powerful collude all the time, I\u2019m not talking only about back room, underground conspiracies. I\u2019m talking about being \u201cin the club\u201d and associating with each other all the time, making deals constantly, business or otherwise, legal and illegal, or a little of both, and helping each other get around the rules all the dumbasses at the bottom have to follow.That\u2019s all \u2014 it\u2019s just all that they do. And if they have to lie, they lie. They control judges and politicians, and the editors of all the major news sources.However, this is all really common sense \u2014 of COURSE they do. What the fuck do you think being rich and powerful is about, anyway?? Having to stand in line? Having to answer up? Having to play by the rules?No. That is for peasants, not the stunningly wealthy people who live on a plane very different from anyone else.It doesn\u2019t mean they are immune, and they can be brought down, but mostly they will rise back up again. Why? Because they\u2019re rich, and powerful . . . Someone has to be. First, SR1419 . . . No, I am not naive. A lot of other things, maybe, but not naive.

The powerful seem to play good cop, bad cop a lot \u2014 the Democrats are sort of the nicer cop who might get you an extra blanket for the cold night in your cell \u2014 the Republicans are the cops who will beat your head in with a gun butt \u2014 but in the end, it\u2019s the same prison, and you\u2019re still not the one in charge. Like George W. Bush said \u2014 on camera \u2014 the \u201celites\u201d are his base. Well, they\u2019re Obama\u2019s base too, and every other politician. The rest of the people are simply appeased and entertained as much as possible, until they have to be tasered. Anyway. Yes, the rich and powerful compete \u2014 they also kill each other and destroy each other\u2019s empires \u2014 but if the rabble start to really rise up, they will align to put them down however they can. Whereas the Communists just tried to harness the energy of the rabble to destroy their own enemies . . . But I\u2019m digressing. And I\u2019m sure you get my point. When I say the rich and powerful collude all the time, I\u2019m not talking only about back room, underground conspiracies. I\u2019m talking about being \u201cin the club\u201d and associating with each other all the time, making deals constantly, business or otherwise, legal and illegal, or a little of both, and helping each other get around the rules all the dumbasses at the bottom have to follow. That\u2019s all \u2014 it\u2019s just all that they do. And if they have to lie, they lie. They control judges and politicians, and the editors of all the major news sources. However, this is all really common sense \u2014 of COURSE they do. What the fuck do you think being rich and powerful is about, anyway?? Having to stand in line? Having to answer up? Having to play by the rules? No. That is for peasants, not the stunningly wealthy people who live on a plane very different from anyone else. It doesn\u2019t mean they are immune, and they can be brought down, but mostly they will rise back up again. Why? Because they\u2019re rich, and powerful . . . Someone has to be. checkthemapsays:July 28, 2009 at 6:24 pmUncinus wrote:Okay then, lets assume that\u2019s true. Let\u2019s also assume that the government has a secret weather modification program.

The names of clouds went through several evolutions which varied by country, and were not settled at Hayden\u2019s time. Many of the photos had clouds names that don\u2019t exactly match the modern usage. He actually proposed his own name for some cloud types.

That it only makes strategic sense for there to be in the future?The proof is in the scholarly white-papers that may be found with research, and in the thousands of pictures that cannot be explained away as cirrus or altostratus undulatus formations.How can you reach the foregone conclusion that you are in a position to tell us with any authority that no operations are underway?

Potential types of particles for injection include sulfur dioxide, aluminumoxide dust or even designer self-levitating aerosols that might be engineered to migrate toparticular regions (e.g. over the arctic) or to rise above the stratospher (so as not tointerfere in stratospheric chemistry). Because of the relative horizontal stability of thestratosphere compared to the troposphere, the residence time of injected particles isapproximately 1-2 years.3 As a result, such a scheme would require only annual orbiannual replenishment.\u201d\u201cA 1992 report of the National Research Council4 was the first to systematically estimatethe potential costs of a program of stratospheric albedo modification. Their estimate wasbased on the use of a standard naval gun system dispensing commercial aluminum oxidedust to counteract the warming effect of a CO2 doubling. Undiscounted annual costs for a40-year project were estimated to be $100 billion.

In this paper, weconsider a number of proposals, under two main headings: (i) alteration of theEarth\u2019s radiation balance, which involves either reducing the amount of sunlightthat reaches the Earth using space shades/mirrors, or increasing the proportion ofincident sunlight that is reflected back into space using stratospheric aerosols,tropospheric aerosols or changes in the land/ocean surface; and (ii) removal andstorage of atmospheric CO2, which involves capturing CO2 from the atmospherethrough ocean fertilisation (using iron addition or ocean pipes), marine-algaecultivation, electrochemically-induced increases in ocean alkalinity or \u0333air capture\u2018schemes (such as \u0333synthetic trees\u2018). \u201d\u201c104.i.b. Stratospheric aerosolsThis technique aims to cool the Earth\u2018s troposphere and surface by increasing thebackscattering of radiation in the stratosphere (which increases planetary albedo) using airborne sub-microscopic particles such as sulphate, metals, dielectrics, resonant scatterers or dust [A12].These aerosol particles would be created byreleasing aerosol precursors into the stratosphere. This could be done by: releasingprecursors at the Earth\u2018s surface and allowing them to be carried into thestratosphere; firing them into the stratosphere from the Earth\u2018s surface; or deliveringthem into the stratosphere using high-altitude balloons or aircraft [B2] (possibly byaddition to aviation fuel, which could reduce the cost of delivery [Q15]). Injectioncould either take place in the tropics (with the aim of obtaining global coverage) or inthe Arctic (with the aim of reducing warming in this region, which is particularlyvulnerable to anthropogenic climate change).There are a number of uncertainties about the potential impacts of these schemes onthe environment21,22. In particular, the effects of stratospheric aerosols on the climatesystem are not fully understood [AD4] \u2014 although they are known to affect circulationpatterns, stratospheric ozone concentrations (which affect climate) [AD2] and uppertropospheric cloud formation (a particular concern is that these schemes couldincrease the cover of high cirrus clouds in the tropics, which could increasewarming). Changes observed after volcanic eruptions (which can inject aerosols intothe stratosphere) suggest that the climatic response to stratospheric aerosol forcingis regionally variable [AD3]. In particular, they indicate that there may be significantdecreases in precipitation over land23 (which could lead to drought) and changes inthe North Atlantic Oscillation (which could lead to warmer winters over Eurasia) [B6].The potential impact of the schemes on ecosystems also remains uncertain, butaerosols can affect photosynthesis by increasing the amount of diffuse solar radiationand decreasing the amount of direct solar radiation [A14] and can causeenvironmental pollution. \u201chttp://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/climatechange/research/pdf/geo-engineering-0409.pdf\u2026what would it look like?

I have never seen anyone here claim that individual trails drift together to form X\u2019s and grids. sovereignpatriotusasays:August 1, 2009 at 10:24 amSuntour,\u201cThe altostratus undulatus is a type of low altocumulus cloud with signature undulations within it.\u201d -http://www.answers.com/topic/altostratus-undulatus-cloud\u201cAltocumulus undulatus \u2013 Precipitation likely within 15-20 hours if wind is steady\u2026Mostly threatens precipitation\u201d \u2013 Weather Wizard\u2019s Cloud Book 1989 Algonquin Books (the work of Louis Rubin, famed forecaster and weather expert)\u201cAn altostratus cloud usually forms ahead of storms with continuous rain or snow.\u201d \u2013http://www.windows.ucar.edu/tour/link=/earth/Atmosphere/clouds/altostratus.html&edu=highHOW TO CLASSIFY CLOUDS video \u2013http://www.ehow.com/video_4435914_classify-clouds.html?ref=Track2&utm_source=askMeteorologist tells you that \u2018stratocumulus clouds proceed precipitation\u2019.Now, \u2018Stratocumulus undulatus\u2019 clouds are also claimed to be what people are witnessing, along with \u2018altostratus undulatus\u2019, and \u2018altocumulus undulatus\u2019 clouds.

All three of those formations are responsible for \u2018wavy parallel lines of cloud strips\u2019, and they usually proceed bad weather that doesn\u2019t manifest with quite a few of those \u2018persistent contrail\u2019 formations.I\u2019m having trouble understanding what your point is in that last sentence. If those cloud formations are responsible for wavy clouds and they preceed bad weather (not all of them do), what does that have to do with persistent contrails? In a lot of cases, conditions for persistent contrails do preceed bad weather and\u2026if wavy clouds preceed bad weather\u2026doesn\u2019t that back up the \u201cpersistent contrail\u201d theory? I may be way off base with the point you\u2019re trying to make, if so I apologize.By sovereignpatriotusa-And flight path? Many \u2018persistent contrail\u2019 formations have been observed to show up where there is little air traffic (according to Flightaware), with planes that are there only long enough to create the trails, and do not seem to be part of any \u2018regular route\u2019 traffic (according to eyewitness reports from knowledgeable individuals) .People underestimate the amount of air traffic above their head, until conditions are right for persistent contrals\u2026because they leave a trail that stays all day long. You never hear people say \u201cI had 8 jets pass over my house and didn\u2019t leave any trails\u201d, because you can\u2019t see those jets without using a flight tracker\u2026and of course where\u2019s the conspiracy in that.By sovereignpatriotusa-If temperature of day or night, season or weather made no difference at 30000 Ft., then wouldn\u2019t contrails persist all the time, every instance, from the beginning of jet history? Yet, MOST contrails should not persist, and if they did those \u2018persistent contrails\u2019 would not need to be designated \u2018occasional\u2019.No, because there are a lot of factors that contribute the the formation of a persistent contrail. Are these factors \u201crare\u201d? Not at all, especially not when conditions in one particular area are right for them. It\u2019s when conditions are right people see high numbers of persistent contrails, referred to by chemtrailers as \u201cspray days\u201d. But I also read on chemtrailcentral about stretches where there is \u201cno spraying\u201d and they finally have blue skies and puffy \u201cnatrual\u201d clouds, so even by chemtrailer standards, they could also be called occasional.By sovereignpatriotusa-Break it down for me. What % of time do contrails persist? What % of THOSE meet the right conditions to become \u2018cirrus like\u2019 clouds? And further, what % of THOSE stick around in the right place to be over-layered enough to create nearly perfect grid formations?The % keeps getting smaller and smaller, yet your use of this keeps increasing.You questions aren\u2019t reasonable in that there are so many factors present in creating those conditions that it would be virtually impossible to track that data down to even vague percentages. The reason being, it\u2019s all completely based on the right atmospheric conditions (temp/humidity), the location of the plane in relation to those conditions (altitude, longitude, latitude), the of the plane\u2019s engines (less powerful engines leave a smaller contrail footprint), the weight of the airplane itself (heavier planes use more thrust than lighter planes). The only thing even remotely predictible in this convoluted mess of random events is the location of the non-directional beacons, which commercial airliners use to navigate the skies. But even that it doesn\u2019t take into account the random intersection of airplanes paths between beacons.I\u2019m sure that a location like Florida, coastal and gulf states are more prone to contrail formation because of the humidity in the air. And flyover states are prone to contrail formation because of the sheer number of planes flying at high altitude back and forth across the country. But I\u2019m no meteorologist and to be honest I don\u2019t really care enough to spend hours researching that information.By sovereignpatriotusa-Have conditions for persistent contrails increased enough to justify the frequency that \u2018persistent contrails\u2019 are witnessed? If so, how did this change in weather come about? Has \u2018global warming\u2019 caused an environment which supports longer persisting contrails?Yes, but I don\u2019t believe that the atmosphere changed that much, it\u2019s more likely WE changed. Airplanes of today are designed to carry more passengers than they did 10, 20 or 30 years ago. Their engines are much more powerful and they are much heavier\u2026not to mention that overall there are more planes in the sky now than there ever were. These factors alone are enough to considerably increase the frequency of persistent contrails.By sovereignpatriotusa-Does any of that even matter, in the face of the evidence regarding the propositions to release barium and aluminum into the atmosphere to assist EMF propagation, and to manage the climate?Not really. Even if everything you say is true, what are the people of the world going to do? Rise up? Revolt against the Government? Why participate in a witch hunt based on a belief without facts? If there are facts, then I am certainly willing to change my mind, but I don\u2019t see anything beyond speculation and rumor.By sovereignpatriotusa-What if it all looks the same? If I gave you poison water that looks the same as pure water, would it mean that just because they appear similar it could be argued they are the same thing?How do you know it\u2019s poison? I\u2019d be stupid to drink poison even if it looks like water\u2026but you do not KNOW that it (\u201cchemtrails\u201d) are poison. There are no physical tests that have been done that you are willing to accept.So\u2026if no physical tests apply to your statement, how can you be sure that it isn\u2019t water (persistent contrail)?I am not saying that it is IMPOSSIBLE that persistent contrails aren\u2019t \u201cchemtrails\u201d, but current evidence for them is very strongly against it. If some other evidence comes to light that sheds doubt on my beliefs, I\u2019ll certainly consider it and reassess my belief.

Uncinus (Mick)says:August 11, 2009 at 3:06 amNot ruffled exactly, just rather dissapointed that people tend to wander off topic. The only thing that will bring clarity to the subject is looking at the evidence with a scientific eye. Have contrails unexpectedly changed? Is there anything in them that is being added deliberately? Is it causing any effect? These are all questions that can be answered to a high degree of certainty by examining the evidence. If there was an effect, it would be measurable. If they have changed, then they would be different to how they were before.But when faced with the evidence that contrails have NOT changed, and that there is NOTHING unusual in them, and that there has been NO unexplained measurable effect attributable to contrails, then the theorists simply revert back to a more general theory of \u201cthere\u2019s a secret government, weather modification and HAARP exist, hence the chemtrail theory must be correct\u201d.So, I suggest, to move the discussion along, yes, let\u2019s assume all the first part of that, assume that there is a secret government, and a secret weather modification program, and a secret use of HAARP, then now explain, with actual science, what evidence is there that contrails are involved.Nobody can.

[I remember it looking like a long white ribbon being dragged behind the jetliner]3) persistent contrail with no spreading. [It would stretch horizon to horizon and then over time become a wriggly line and then evaporate]4) persistent contrail with spreading. [I remember referring to it as \u201cthe trail turning into a cloud\u201d]Of course childhood memories are unreliable.I also distinctly remember it always being sunny with blue skies and white cotton-ball clouds.Which is highly unlikely as I grew up in the rain-soaked North of England.I find it bizarre that people, even when presented with irrefutable contradicting evidence, will cling to a conspiracy theory.[Which should more accurately be called a \u201cconspiracy hypothesis\u201d.] Hi Uncinus I want to first thank you for your site, and for taking the time to post all the evidence and refutation.

You can come up with a BILLION theories as to what these trails are, but to refute what science says they are, you need proof\u2026 There is NO PROOF that any line, partial line, pattern, shape that has come out of a jet engine is ANYTHING but a contrail. Do you understand the word proof and how important it is in this case? You people are accusing so many people of doing something, yet you have NOTHING (other than some random internet based CRAP) that PROVES it. It\u2019s insane. I hope one of you chemtards wins the lottery someday and hires an independent company to sample/test a trail. Hey, that\u2019s not a bad idea\u2026someone should start a website asking for donation to do just that! I know I\u2019d contribute a hundred bucks or so if it meant that all the chemtards would have to eat their ridiculous words!

So\u2026it is not so unlikely to my mind (absolute scientific proof -with all due respects- is for those who are so alienated from their bodies that they do not trust the alignment of their reason and observation with the feeling in their gut) that \u2018the government\u2019 (i.e. the military) has, does and will reproduce tests with airplanes in which chemicals are sprayed. But I suspect that ours is a deeper rift. Just as you do not believe in the possibility of chemtrails (and hence danger of these to yourself) you probably also disparage those of us who believe that the moon landing was an elaborate cold-war hoax, or that Haarp is designed to manipulate weather as a weapon. And the reason that people like you believe the \u2018official story\u2019 (as opposed to the real story) is that you do not properly understand the nature of POWER and how it has always, and always will make things up in order to stay in power. Our ancestors called the root of this tendency \u2018satan\u2019 \u2018the father of all lies\u2019, but even the book in which these words are taken (\u2018the Bible\u2019) has been distorted in order to serve the political needs of those who would grasp and keep power over others. The children of Satan, to those in power (\u2018Christians\u2019 lol) are those who questions the official story, offering \u2018lies\u2019 that \u2018corrupt\u2019 the good, hardworking, earnest and healthy American People. It is truly sad to witness the denial which people have to go through in order to prop up a vast charade because living without it seems too scary. It is sad, and it will become dangerous, because in order to defend what is \u2018good and wholesome\u2019 witch hunts must be undertaken whereby those who seriously challenge the \u2018official story\u2019 will be dealt with, surprise, with very little compassion. I know everybody wants to believe the official story, but wanting to believe does not make it so. Sure, the \u2018conspiracy theorists\u2019 are a mixed bag of various levels of thought and understanding, but at least they have the sense to smell that \u2018something stinks in Denmark\u2019 All of our puzzle pieces do not amount to science, but neither do we think that they need to. Gleaned from comparative history old and new, from the coincidences and gaps in the official story, from our own observations and feeling about human nature and the nature of politics and power, all of these puzzle pieces are coming together, and chemtrail theory is not necessary for such a picture to make absolute sense, given our study of history, if not \u2018science\u2019. Let me suggest that you stop worshipping science and recognize that the history of the will to power is also a reasonable subject of study, and one which might give you a fresh view of things. Let me also suggest that feelings are not nothing, and that maybe you should get in touch instead of pushing away in the attempt to get at \u2018pure science\u2019. That said, I like your site and have spent way too much time reading the back and forth between you, your team of yes-men and the chemtards, who are, like you, just trying to help you see something.

It has no definite shape. It looks like cloud vapor. It looks smeared and a little dirty. It does not resemble any naturally occurring cloud. It has no edges, but looks like something blurry hanging incongruously high up in the air.It is not fog. It is not rising up out of the mountains. It is not one of the first clouds that regularly appear over the mountains early in the day, which mean it will later rain as the clouds quickly roll in from the desert and gather over the mountains, eventually producing a monsoon. All these things are very familiar to anyone who lives here.Again, it is high in the sky \u2014 which is otherwise perfectly clear.Within ten minutes, the smear has grown to triple its original size. It has simply expanded in all directions, but remains fuzzy, undefined, murky looking. It is now a very large suspended glob in the middle of the sky.The glob then proceeds to literally EJECT cloud vapor.The cloud vapor comes POURING out of the glob in the sky, heading East, in a sheet.The cloud vapor spreads rapidly across the sky \u2014 emanating completely from the amorphous blob, which is now very big, maybe six or seven times its original size, or larger.So now, we have a huge amorphous blob of murky vapor, from which is pouring a thin sheet of white vapor, extended like an arm across the sky.The people who have parked their cars to watch this occurrence now see a few white jets appear.As they fly by, long white trails extend from the plane, and within about five minutes, nine parallel lines have been laid out alongside and within the long sheet of vapor extending from the original blob.Finally one of the planes lays one extremely long trail across all the other parallel trails \u2014 almost as if sowing them together.Then the planes disappear, and the blob ceases to produce any more vapor.All the vapor in the sky lingers for the rest of the day.If this is a natural occurrence, please tell me what it was. I have never seen anything like it in my life. Hello, I have a question for whomever is in charge of this website. Please explain one phenomenon I just witnessed, if you would.

Surely you are not that naive. checkthemapsays:July 28, 2009 at 6:15 pmFirst, SR1419 . . .No, I am not naive. A lot of other things, maybe, but not naive.Of course the rich and powerful compete, that isn\u2019t at issue. But when do they not compete? They don\u2019t compete when they are working together to keep everyone else down.It\u2019s like the two supposed political parties in the US. They differ on many issues, often more than intheory than in practice, but on some levels they are definitely separate parties. But look at how often they cross all party lines to work together to further the interests of who? The wealthy and powerful.Foreign policy, economic globalization, the War on Drugs and Terror and whatever else, the increase in prisons and the prison population \u2014 this has all continued along pretty much the same lines for a long time, regardless of the party in power, who controls Congress.The powerful seem to play good cop, bad cop a lot \u2014 the Democrats are sort of the nicer cop who might get you an extra blanket for the cold night in your cell \u2014 the Republicans are the cops who will beat your head in with a gun butt \u2014 but in the end, it\u2019s the same prison, and you\u2019re still not the one in charge.Like George W. Bush said \u2014 on camera \u2014 the \u201celites\u201d are his base.Well, they\u2019re Obama\u2019s base too, and every other politician. The rest of the people are simply appeased and entertained as much as possible, until they have to be tasered.Anyway.Yes, the rich and powerful compete \u2014 they also kill each other and destroy each other\u2019s empires \u2014 but if the rabble start to really rise up, they will align to put them down however they can.Whereas the Communists just tried to harness the energy of the rabble to destroy their own enemies . . .But I\u2019m digressing.And I\u2019m sure you get my point.When I say the rich and powerful collude all the time, I\u2019m not talking only about back room, underground conspiracies. I\u2019m talking about being \u201cin the club\u201d and associating with each other all the time, making deals constantly, business or otherwise, legal and illegal, or a little of both, and helping each other get around the rules all the dumbasses at the bottom have to follow.That\u2019s all \u2014 it\u2019s just all that they do. And if they have to lie, they lie. They control judges and politicians, and the editors of all the major news sources.However, this is all really common sense \u2014 of COURSE they do. What the fuck do you think being rich and powerful is about, anyway?? Having to stand in line? Having to answer up? Having to play by the rules?No. That is for peasants, not the stunningly wealthy people who live on a plane very different from anyone else.It doesn\u2019t mean they are immune, and they can be brought down, but mostly they will rise back up again. Why? Because they\u2019re rich, and powerful . . . Someone has to be. First, SR1419 . . . No, I am not naive. A lot of other things, maybe, but not naive.

I\u2019m talking about being \u201cin the club\u201d and associating with each other all the time, making deals constantly, business or otherwise, legal and illegal, or a little of both, and helping each other get around the rules all the dumbasses at the bottom have to follow. That\u2019s all \u2014 it\u2019s just all that they do. And if they have to lie, they lie. They control judges and politicians, and the editors of all the major news sources. However, this is all really common sense \u2014 of COURSE they do. What the fuck do you think being rich and powerful is about, anyway?? Having to stand in line? Having to answer up? Having to play by the rules? No. That is for peasants, not the stunningly wealthy people who live on a plane very different from anyone else. It doesn\u2019t mean they are immune, and they can be brought down, but mostly they will rise back up again. Why? Because they\u2019re rich, and powerful . . . Someone has to be. First, SR1419 . . . No, I am not naive. A lot of other things, maybe, but not naive. Of course the rich and powerful compete, that isn\u2019t at issue. But when do they not compete? They don\u2019t compete when they are working together to keep everyone else down. It\u2019s like the two supposed political parties in the US. They differ on many issues, often more than intheory than in practice, but on some levels they are definitely separate parties. But look at how often they cross all party lines to work together to further the interests of who? The wealthy and powerful. Foreign policy, economic globalization, the War on Drugs and Terror and whatever else, the increase in prisons and the prison population \u2014 this has all continued along pretty much the same lines for a long time, regardless of the party in power, who controls Congress. The powerful seem to play good cop, bad cop a lot \u2014 the Democrats are sort of the nicer cop who might get you an extra blanket for the cold night in your cell \u2014 the Republicans are the cops who will beat your head in with a gun butt \u2014 but in the end, it\u2019s the same prison, and you\u2019re still not the one in charge. Like George W. Bush said \u2014 on camera \u2014 the \u201celites\u201d are his base. Well, they\u2019re Obama\u2019s base too, and every other politician. The rest of the people are simply appeased and entertained as much as possible, until they have to be tasered. Anyway. Yes, the rich and powerful compete \u2014 they also kill each other and destroy each other\u2019s empires \u2014 but if the rabble start to really rise up, they will align to put them down however they can.

Some I have posted above, others like this patent from Bernard Eastland (which I am aware has been presented to you before\u2026) can be directly backed up with videos such as this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxRnkfvO_EU I am taking the temporary position that con/chemtrails need not necessarily be part of any plan for global depopulation per se, and that will allow us to focus on their application as part of a possible undisclosed program aimed at command and control of the global airspace, both atmospheric and electromagnetic. Again, that video ishttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxRnkfvO_EU If in fact the military security apparatus is using a top-level program to modify the conditions of the battlespace (which they have always done as far as they could reach), and either military or commercial aircraft (or a combination) are being employed to meet their objectives, then we should more closely examine the issue.Is there any reason we should not? Especially when the consequences for detrimental effects on lifeforms exist, completely unintentional or otherwise. Would you argue against it? So, again\u2026 just for the sake of a new tact, let\u2019s remind ourselves to leave behind any notion or suspicion regarding biological experimentation using contrails as a vehicle for delivery. We are now completely focusing on the much firmer ground that support the existence of a top-level command/control operation involving atmospheric and electromagnetic programs, which are potentially using aerosols as part of said programs. What can we make of that, Uncinus and clique? TO CHECKTHEMAP: I applaud your approach and perspective. Please contact me on my youtube channelhttp://www.youtube.com/user/sovereignpatriotusafor further discussion if possible. Remain Vigilant! Stay Sovereign SPUSA First, There are several ways in in which clouds form straight line, but basically it boils down to air essentially being a fluid, and forming waves. so 2+2 = 5 does it? That is a very blatant misrepresentation, and thought I would think it silly to necessitate a notation, let\u2019s throw it in just to cover all bases. http://wiki.answers.com/Q/Is_air_a_gas_or_liquid Second, your Arthur Hayden picture is mislabelled. The correct name for parallel line cloud formations is Altostratus Undulatus, an easy typo for the editor in 1925 to make. This formation is very rare, and primarily precipitates bad weather such as rainfall. One of the best tools for climatologists, meteorologists, and interested lay-people is the book \u201cThe Weather Wizard Cloud Book\u201d. In it, you will find all the tools necessary to understand weather patterns in a time-tested and history proven way with tons of high-quality photographs.Nowhere in the book are examples of contrails-turned-super cloud formations, even though the work was developed even into the 1980\u2019s.Any attempt to discredit the integrity, and contribution to the science of meteorology by Louis Rubin, will be an abject and epic failure. For, as anybody truly in the field of study will tell you the \u2018Wythe Avenue Weather Wizard\u2019 could call it like no other. And lastly, The case for aerosol saturation of the environment with toxic heavy metals for use with cutting-edge communications and weapons projects involving HAARP and similar programs are just too much to ignore.For instance, the Eastland patent of which I know you are aware, which yet again outlines plans for barium dispersal.http://www.patentstorm.us/patents/4686605.html Some other threads we could pull on if we had more clearance are here: http://www.dtic.mil/srch/doc?collection=t3&id=AD0739194{{Studies of Barium Excitation by Molecular Beam Magnetic Resonance Techniques.}} http://www.dtic.mil/srch/doc?collection=t3&id=ADA121087{{Numerical Simulation of a Possible Freezing and Sheet Formation Mechanism for Barium Cloud Striations.}} Additionally, other military programs outline the use of barium oxide and aluminum oxide for propagating EMF waves.

Potential types of particles for injection include sulfur dioxide, aluminumoxide dust or even designer self-levitating aerosols that might be engineered to migrate toparticular regions (e.g. over the arctic) or to rise above the stratospher (so as not tointerfere in stratospheric chemistry). Because of the relative horizontal stability of thestratosphere compared to the troposphere, the residence time of injected particles isapproximately 1-2 years.3 As a result, such a scheme would require only annual orbiannual replenishment.\u201d\u201cA 1992 report of the National Research Council4 was the first to systematically estimatethe potential costs of a program of stratospheric albedo modification. Their estimate wasbased on the use of a standard naval gun system dispensing commercial aluminum oxidedust to counteract the warming effect of a CO2 doubling. Undiscounted annual costs for a40-year project were estimated to be $100 billion. More recent analysis5 has suggestedthat well designed systems might reduce this cost to as little as a few hundred milliondollars per year \u2013 clearly well within the budget of almost all nations, and much lesscostly than any program to dramatically reduce the emissions of CO2 . Indeed, there are ahandful of individuals who could create the endowment necessary to generate an annualannuity to operate such a program.\u201d(I bet wonder who they had in mind?\u2026)So let me ask you, if aluminum oxide, barium oxide, or other materials were dispersed from aircraft as stated in that excerpt, and this one:\u201cGeo-engineering, defined here as intentional large-scale manipulation of the globalenvironment, has been suggested as a means of mitigating the effects ofanthropogenic greenhouse-gas emissions on climate, without necessarily reducingemissions. \u201d\u201cA number of geo-engineering options for mitigating the effects of anthropogenicgreenhouse-gas emissions on climate have been proposed. In this paper, weconsider a number of proposals, under two main headings: (i) alteration of theEarth\u2019s radiation balance, which involves either reducing the amount of sunlightthat reaches the Earth using space shades/mirrors, or increasing the proportion ofincident sunlight that is reflected back into space using stratospheric aerosols,tropospheric aerosols or changes in the land/ocean surface; and (ii) removal andstorage of atmospheric CO2, which involves capturing CO2 from the atmospherethrough ocean fertilisation (using iron addition or ocean pipes), marine-algaecultivation, electrochemically-induced increases in ocean alkalinity or \u0333air capture\u2018schemes (such as \u0333synthetic trees\u2018). \u201d\u201c104.i.b. Stratospheric aerosolsThis technique aims to cool the Earth\u2018s troposphere and surface by increasing thebackscattering of radiation in the stratosphere (which increases planetary albedo) using airborne sub-microscopic particles such as sulphate, metals, dielectrics, resonant scatterers or dust [A12].These aerosol particles would be created byreleasing aerosol precursors into the stratosphere. This could be done by: releasingprecursors at the Earth\u2018s surface and allowing them to be carried into thestratosphere; firing them into the stratosphere from the Earth\u2018s surface; or deliveringthem into the stratosphere using high-altitude balloons or aircraft [B2] (possibly byaddition to aviation fuel, which could reduce the cost of delivery [Q15]). Injectioncould either take place in the tropics (with the aim of obtaining global coverage) or inthe Arctic (with the aim of reducing warming in this region, which is particularlyvulnerable to anthropogenic climate change).There are a number of uncertainties about the potential impacts of these schemes onthe environment21,22. In particular, the effects of stratospheric aerosols on the climatesystem are not fully understood [AD4] \u2014 although they are known to affect circulationpatterns, stratospheric ozone concentrations (which affect climate) [AD2] and uppertropospheric cloud formation (a particular concern is that these schemes couldincrease the cover of high cirrus clouds in the tropics, which could increasewarming). Changes observed after volcanic eruptions (which can inject aerosols intothe stratosphere) suggest that the climatic response to stratospheric aerosol forcingis regionally variable [AD3]. In particular, they indicate that there may be significantdecreases in precipitation over land23 (which could lead to drought) and changes inthe North Atlantic Oscillation (which could lead to warmer winters over Eurasia) [B6].The potential impact of the schemes on ecosystems also remains uncertain, butaerosols can affect photosynthesis by increasing the amount of diffuse solar radiationand decreasing the amount of direct solar radiation [A14] and can causeenvironmental pollution. \u201chttp://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/climatechange/research/pdf/geo-engineering-0409.pdf\u2026what would it look like?

Stratospheric aerosolsThis technique aims to cool the Earth\u2018s troposphere and surface by increasing thebackscattering of radiation in the stratosphere (which increases planetary albedo) using airborne sub-microscopic particles such as sulphate, metals, dielectrics, resonant scatterers or dust [A12]. These aerosol particles would be created byreleasing aerosol precursors into the stratosphere. This could be done by: releasingprecursors at the Earth\u2018s surface and allowing them to be carried into thestratosphere; firing them into the stratosphere from the Earth\u2018s surface; or deliveringthem into the stratosphere using high-altitude balloons or aircraft [B2] (possibly byaddition to aviation fuel, which could reduce the cost of delivery [Q15]). Injectioncould either take place in the tropics (with the aim of obtaining global coverage) or inthe Arctic (with the aim of reducing warming in this region, which is particularlyvulnerable to anthropogenic climate change). There are a number of uncertainties about the potential impacts of these schemes onthe environment21,22. In particular, the effects of stratospheric aerosols on the climatesystem are not fully understood [AD4] \u2014 although they are known to affect circulationpatterns, stratospheric ozone concentrations (which affect climate) [AD2] and uppertropospheric cloud formation (a particular concern is that these schemes couldincrease the cover of high cirrus clouds in the tropics, which could increasewarming). Changes observed after volcanic eruptions (which can inject aerosols intothe stratosphere) suggest that the climatic response to stratospheric aerosol forcingis regionally variable [AD3]. In particular, they indicate that there may be significantdecreases in precipitation over land23 (which could lead to drought) and changes inthe North Atlantic Oscillation (which could lead to warmer winters over Eurasia) [B6].The potential impact of the schemes on ecosystems also remains uncertain, butaerosols can affect photosynthesis by increasing the amount of diffuse solar radiationand decreasing the amount of direct solar radiation [A14] and can causeenvironmental pollution. \u201c http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/climatechange/research/pdf/geo-engineering-0409.pdf \u2026what would it look like?

I have never seen anyone here claim that individual trails drift together to form X\u2019s and grids. sovereignpatriotusasays:August 1, 2009 at 10:24 amSuntour,\u201cThe altostratus undulatus is a type of low altocumulus cloud with signature undulations within it.\u201d -http://www.answers.com/topic/altostratus-undulatus-cloud\u201cAltocumulus undulatus \u2013 Precipitation likely within 15-20 hours if wind is steady\u2026Mostly threatens precipitation\u201d \u2013 Weather Wizard\u2019s Cloud Book 1989 Algonquin Books (the work of Louis Rubin, famed forecaster and weather expert)\u201cAn altostratus cloud usually forms ahead of storms with continuous rain or snow.\u201d \u2013http://www.windows.ucar.edu/tour/link=/earth/Atmosphere/clouds/altostratus.html&edu=highHOW TO CLASSIFY CLOUDS video \u2013http://www.ehow.com/video_4435914_classify-clouds.html?ref=Track2&utm_source=askMeteorologist tells you that \u2018stratocumulus clouds proceed precipitation\u2019.Now, \u2018Stratocumulus undulatus\u2019 clouds are also claimed to be what people are witnessing, along with \u2018altostratus undulatus\u2019, and \u2018altocumulus undulatus\u2019 clouds.

All three of those formations are responsible for \u2018wavy parallel lines of cloud strips\u2019, and they usually proceed bad weather that doesn\u2019t manifest with quite a few of those \u2018persistent contrail\u2019 formations.I\u2019m having trouble understanding what your point is in that last sentence. If those cloud formations are responsible for wavy clouds and they preceed bad weather (not all of them do), what does that have to do with persistent contrails? In a lot of cases, conditions for persistent contrails do preceed bad weather and\u2026if wavy clouds preceed bad weather\u2026doesn\u2019t that back up the \u201cpersistent contrail\u201d theory? I may be way off base with the point you\u2019re trying to make, if so I apologize.By sovereignpatriotusa-And flight path? Many \u2018persistent contrail\u2019 formations have been observed to show up where there is little air traffic (according to Flightaware), with planes that are there only long enough to create the trails, and do not seem to be part of any \u2018regular route\u2019 traffic (according to eyewitness reports from knowledgeable individuals) .People underestimate the amount of air traffic above their head, until conditions are right for persistent contrals\u2026because they leave a trail that stays all day long. You never hear people say \u201cI had 8 jets pass over my house and didn\u2019t leave any trails\u201d, because you can\u2019t see those jets without using a flight tracker\u2026and of course where\u2019s the conspiracy in that.By sovereignpatriotusa-If temperature of day or night, season or weather made no difference at 30000 Ft., then wouldn\u2019t contrails persist all the time, every instance, from the beginning of jet history? Yet, MOST contrails should not persist, and if they did those \u2018persistent contrails\u2019 would not need to be designated \u2018occasional\u2019.No, because there are a lot of factors that contribute the the formation of a persistent contrail. Are these factors \u201crare\u201d? Not at all, especially not when conditions in one particular area are right for them. It\u2019s when conditions are right people see high numbers of persistent contrails, referred to by chemtrailers as \u201cspray days\u201d. But I also read on chemtrailcentral about stretches where there is \u201cno spraying\u201d and they finally have blue skies and puffy \u201cnatrual\u201d clouds, so even by chemtrailer standards, they could also be called occasional.By sovereignpatriotusa-Break it down for me. What % of time do contrails persist? What % of THOSE meet the right conditions to become \u2018cirrus like\u2019 clouds? And further, what % of THOSE stick around in the right place to be over-layered enough to create nearly perfect grid formations?The % keeps getting smaller and smaller, yet your use of this keeps increasing.You questions aren\u2019t reasonable in that there are so many factors present in creating those conditions that it would be virtually impossible to track that data down to even vague percentages. The reason being, it\u2019s all completely based on the right atmospheric conditions (temp/humidity), the location of the plane in relation to those conditions (altitude, longitude, latitude), the of the plane\u2019s engines (less powerful engines leave a smaller contrail footprint), the weight of the airplane itself (heavier planes use more thrust than lighter planes). The only thing even remotely predictible in this convoluted mess of random events is the location of the non-directional beacons, which commercial airliners use to navigate the skies. But even that it doesn\u2019t take into account the random intersection of airplanes paths between beacons.I\u2019m sure that a location like Florida, coastal and gulf states are more prone to contrail formation because of the humidity in the air. And flyover states are prone to contrail formation because of the sheer number of planes flying at high altitude back and forth across the country. But I\u2019m no meteorologist and to be honest I don\u2019t really care enough to spend hours researching that information.By sovereignpatriotusa-Have conditions for persistent contrails increased enough to justify the frequency that \u2018persistent contrails\u2019 are witnessed? If so, how did this change in weather come about? Has \u2018global warming\u2019 caused an environment which supports longer persisting contrails?Yes, but I don\u2019t believe that the atmosphere changed that much, it\u2019s more likely WE changed. Airplanes of today are designed to carry more passengers than they did 10, 20 or 30 years ago. Their engines are much more powerful and they are much heavier\u2026not to mention that overall there are more planes in the sky now than there ever were. These factors alone are enough to considerably increase the frequency of persistent contrails.By sovereignpatriotusa-Does any of that even matter, in the face of the evidence regarding the propositions to release barium and aluminum into the atmosphere to assist EMF propagation, and to manage the climate?Not really. Even if everything you say is true, what are the people of the world going to do? Rise up? Revolt against the Government? Why participate in a witch hunt based on a belief without facts? If there are facts, then I am certainly willing to change my mind, but I don\u2019t see anything beyond speculation and rumor.By sovereignpatriotusa-What if it all looks the same? If I gave you poison water that looks the same as pure water, would it mean that just because they appear similar it could be argued they are the same thing?How do you know it\u2019s poison? I\u2019d be stupid to drink poison even if it looks like water\u2026but you do not KNOW that it (\u201cchemtrails\u201d) are poison. There are no physical tests that have been done that you are willing to accept.So\u2026if no physical tests apply to your statement, how can you be sure that it isn\u2019t water (persistent contrail)?I am not saying that it is IMPOSSIBLE that persistent contrails aren\u2019t \u201cchemtrails\u201d, but current evidence for them is very strongly against it. If some other evidence comes to light that sheds doubt on my beliefs, I\u2019ll certainly consider it and reassess my belief. By sovereignpatriotusa-Now, \u2018Stratocumulus undulatus\u2019 clouds are also claimed to be what people are witnessing, along with \u2018altostratus undulatus\u2019, and \u2018altocumulus undulatus\u2019 clouds.

And flyover states are prone to contrail formation because of the sheer number of planes flying at high altitude back and forth across the country. But I\u2019m no meteorologist and to be honest I don\u2019t really care enough to spend hours researching that information. By sovereignpatriotusa-Have conditions for persistent contrails increased enough to justify the frequency that \u2018persistent contrails\u2019 are witnessed? If so, how did this change in weather come about? Has \u2018global warming\u2019 caused an environment which supports longer persisting contrails? Yes, but I don\u2019t believe that the atmosphere changed that much, it\u2019s more likely WE changed. Airplanes of today are designed to carry more passengers than they did 10, 20 or 30 years ago. Their engines are much more powerful and they are much heavier\u2026not to mention that overall there are more planes in the sky now than there ever were. These factors alone are enough to considerably increase the frequency of persistent contrails. By sovereignpatriotusa-Does any of that even matter, in the face of the evidence regarding the propositions to release barium and aluminum into the atmosphere to assist EMF propagation, and to manage the climate? Not really. Even if everything you say is true, what are the people of the world going to do? Rise up? Revolt against the Government? Why participate in a witch hunt based on a belief without facts? If there are facts, then I am certainly willing to change my mind, but I don\u2019t see anything beyond speculation and rumor. By sovereignpatriotusa-What if it all looks the same? If I gave you poison water that looks the same as pure water, would it mean that just because they appear similar it could be argued they are the same thing? How do you know it\u2019s poison? I\u2019d be stupid to drink poison even if it looks like water\u2026but you do not KNOW that it (\u201cchemtrails\u201d) are poison. There are no physical tests that have been done that you are willing to accept. So\u2026if no physical tests apply to your statement, how can you be sure that it isn\u2019t water (persistent contrail)? I am not saying that it is IMPOSSIBLE that persistent contrails aren\u2019t \u201cchemtrails\u201d, but current evidence for them is very strongly against it. If some other evidence comes to light that sheds doubt on my beliefs, I\u2019ll certainly consider it and reassess my belief. By sovereignpatriotusa-Now, \u2018Stratocumulus undulatus\u2019 clouds are also claimed to be what people are witnessing, along with \u2018altostratus undulatus\u2019, and \u2018altocumulus undulatus\u2019 clouds. All three of those formations are responsible for \u2018wavy parallel lines of cloud strips\u2019, and they usually proceed bad weather that doesn\u2019t manifest with quite a few of those \u2018persistent contrail\u2019 formations. I\u2019m having trouble understanding what your point is in that last sentence. If those cloud formations are responsible for wavy clouds and they preceed bad weather (not all of them do), what does that have to do with persistent contrails? In a lot of cases, conditions for persistent contrails do preceed bad weather and\u2026if wavy clouds preceed bad weather\u2026doesn\u2019t that back up the \u201cpersistent contrail\u201d theory? I may be way off base with the point you\u2019re trying to make, if so I apologize. By sovereignpatriotusa-And flight path? Many \u2018persistent contrail\u2019 formations have been observed to show up where there is little air traffic (according to Flightaware), with planes that are there only long enough to create the trails, and do not seem to be part of any \u2018regular route\u2019 traffic (according to eyewitness reports from knowledgeable individuals) . People underestimate the amount of air traffic above their head, until conditions are right for persistent contrals\u2026because they leave a trail that stays all day long. You never hear people say \u201cI had 8 jets pass over my house and didn\u2019t leave any trails\u201d, because you can\u2019t see those jets without using a flight tracker\u2026and of course where\u2019s the conspiracy in that. By sovereignpatriotusa-If temperature of day or night, season or weather made no difference at 30000 Ft., then wouldn\u2019t contrails persist all the time, every instance, from the beginning of jet history? Yet, MOST contrails should not persist, and if they did those \u2018persistent contrails\u2019 would not need to be designated \u2018occasional\u2019. No, because there are a lot of factors that contribute the the formation of a persistent contrail. Are these factors \u201crare\u201d? Not at all, especially not when conditions in one particular area are right for them. It\u2019s when conditions are right people see high numbers of persistent contrails, referred to by chemtrailers as \u201cspray days\u201d. But I also read on chemtrailcentral about stretches where there is \u201cno spraying\u201d and they finally have blue skies and puffy \u201cnatrual\u201d clouds, so even by chemtrailer standards, they could also be called occasional. By sovereignpatriotusa-Break it down for me. What % of time do contrails persist? What % of THOSE meet the right conditions to become \u2018cirrus like\u2019 clouds? And further, what % of THOSE stick around in the right place to be over-layered enough to create nearly perfect grid formations?The % keeps getting smaller and smaller, yet your use of this keeps increasing. You questions aren\u2019t reasonable in that there are so many factors present in creating those conditions that it would be virtually impossible to track that data down to even vague percentages. The reason being, it\u2019s all completely based on the right atmospheric conditions (temp/humidity), the location of the plane in relation to those conditions (altitude, longitude, latitude), the of the plane\u2019s engines (less powerful engines leave a smaller contrail footprint), the weight of the airplane itself (heavier planes use more thrust than lighter planes). The only thing even remotely predictible in this convoluted mess of random events is the location of the non-directional beacons, which commercial airliners use to navigate the skies. But even that it doesn\u2019t take into account the random intersection of airplanes paths between beacons. I\u2019m sure that a location like Florida, coastal and gulf states are more prone to contrail formation because of the humidity in the air. And flyover states are prone to contrail formation because of the sheer number of planes flying at high altitude back and forth across the country.

Uncinus (Mick)says:August 11, 2009 at 3:06 amNot ruffled exactly, just rather dissapointed that people tend to wander off topic. The only thing that will bring clarity to the subject is looking at the evidence with a scientific eye. Have contrails unexpectedly changed?

If they have changed, then they would be different to how they were before.But when faced with the evidence that contrails have NOT changed, and that there is NOTHING unusual in them, and that there has been NO unexplained measurable effect attributable to contrails, then the theorists simply revert back to a more general theory of \u201cthere\u2019s a secret government, weather modification and HAARP exist, hence the chemtrail theory must be correct\u201d.So, I suggest, to move the discussion along, yes, let\u2019s assume all the first part of that, assume that there is a secret government, and a secret weather modification program, and a secret use of HAARP, then now explain, with actual science, what evidence is there that contrails are involved.Nobody can.

[I remember it looking like a long white ribbon being dragged behind the jetliner]3) persistent contrail with no spreading. [It would stretch horizon to horizon and then over time become a wriggly line and then evaporate]4) persistent contrail with spreading. [I remember referring to it as \u201cthe trail turning into a cloud\u201d]Of course childhood memories are unreliable.I also distinctly remember it always being sunny with blue skies and white cotton-ball clouds.Which is highly unlikely as I grew up in the rain-soaked North of England.I find it bizarre that people, even when presented with irrefutable contradicting evidence, will cling to a conspiracy theory.[Which should more accurately be called a \u201cconspiracy hypothesis\u201d.] Hi Uncinus I want to first thank you for your site, and for taking the time to post all the evidence and refutation.

In fact, I spent 40+ years learning about aviation and the atmosphere while you were busy looking at your shoes and eating your boogers. You REALLY should have paid attention in science class. In fact, you shouldn\u2019t have dropped out of school in the 3rd grade.

You have paranoid speculation and assumption\u2026nothing more! I know that last sentence is lost on you. You just don\u2019t understand the importance of actual scientific research. No, what you do is NOT research. What you do is take info and jam it all together and form and OPINION in your mind.

In fact, I spent 40+ years learning about aviation and the atmosphere while you were busy looking at your shoes and eating your boogers. You REALLY should have paid attention in science class. In fact, you shouldn\u2019t have dropped out of school in the 3rd grade. Had you stayed and paid some attention, you would understand how the scientific method and peer reviewed information is CRITICAL in forming an opinion in matters of science. YOU just seem to think one should be able to make ridiculous assumptions and then claim it to be \u201cfact\u201d. Fact MATTERS in discussions about science and you have ZERO facts on your side. You have paranoid speculation and assumption\u2026nothing more! I know that last sentence is lost on you. You just don\u2019t understand the importance of actual scientific research. No, what you do is NOT research. What you do is take info and jam it all together and form and OPINION in your mind.

So\u2026it is not so unlikely to my mind (absolute scientific proof -with all due respects- is for those who are so alienated from their bodies that they do not trust the alignment of their reason and observation with the feeling in their gut) that \u2018the government\u2019 (i.e. the military) has, does and will reproduce tests with airplanes in which chemicals are sprayed. But I suspect that ours is a deeper rift. Just as you do not believe in the possibility of chemtrails (and hence danger of these to yourself) you probably also disparage those of us who believe that the moon landing was an elaborate cold-war hoax, or that Haarp is designed to manipulate weather as a weapon. And the reason that people like you believe the \u2018official story\u2019 (as opposed to the real story) is that you do not properly understand the nature of POWER and how it has always, and always will make things up in order to stay in power. Our ancestors called the root of this tendency \u2018satan\u2019 \u2018the father of all lies\u2019, but even the book in which these words are taken (\u2018the Bible\u2019) has been distorted in order to serve the political needs of those who would grasp and keep power over others. The children of Satan, to those in power (\u2018Christians\u2019 lol) are those who questions the official story, offering \u2018lies\u2019 that \u2018corrupt\u2019 the good, hardworking, earnest and healthy American People. It is truly sad to witness the denial which people have to go through in order to prop up a vast charade because living without it seems too scary. It is sad, and it will become dangerous, because in order to defend what is \u2018good and wholesome\u2019 witch hunts must be undertaken whereby those who seriously challenge the \u2018official story\u2019 will be dealt with, surprise, with very little compassion. I know everybody wants to believe the official story, but wanting to believe does not make it so. Sure, the \u2018conspiracy theorists\u2019 are a mixed bag of various levels of thought and understanding, but at least they have the sense to smell that \u2018something stinks in Denmark\u2019 All of our puzzle pieces do not amount to science, but neither do we think that they need to. Gleaned from comparative history old and new, from the coincidences and gaps in the official story, from our own observations and feeling about human nature and the nature of politics and power, all of these puzzle pieces are coming together, and chemtrail theory is not necessary for such a picture to make absolute sense, given our study of history, if not \u2018science\u2019.
