Home to the Sangster International Airport, the busiest airport in the English-speakingCaribbean, as well as a bustlingcruise port, Montego Bay is also well known as a tourism hub. There\u2019s a MoBay (as the locals call it) resort for every taste and budget but you\u2019ll never experience true Jamaican culture there, no matter how many Red Stripe and rum punches you drink. The key to connecting with the real Jamaica is to escape the hotels. Stroll down Fort Street, dotted with pastel buildings, bustling locals and the 18th-centuryFort Montego,equipped with three brass cannons. Or opt for afood tourand taste local staples like gizzada coconut tarts or curry goat. When exploring Jamaican cuisine, why stop at jerk chicken? There\u2019s so much more that the island has to offer. Montego Bay has its share of tourist traps, but those are arguably outnumbered by the local haunts and spots that make the island such an incredible cultural hub. Whether you\u2019re called by MoBay\u2019s breathtaking nature, hip music scene, or flavorful cuisine, we\u2019ve got everything you need to make the most of your next Jamaican adventure. **Your trip isn\u2019t complete until you\u2026** See: The glistening purple and blue lights of Luminous Lagoon.Float along on a magical night time boat cruise through the microscopic organisms that fill Montego Bay\u2019sLuminous Lagoon, one of the largest of only five bioluminescent bays in the world. Touch: Medicinal herbs and local vegetables like callaloo and cassava while learning to prepare traditional dishes atRastafari Indigenous Village.Explore the natural lifestyle and discover the way of life of Jamaica\u2019s most famous cultural group. Smell: The fragrance of black gladioli, orchids, and begonias atAhhh Ras Natango Botanical Garden.Tucked into the hills, the garden showcases the essence of Jamaica\u2019s natural beauty. Wear non-slip shoes in this cliffside Eden and arrive in the morning for the best animal sightings, especially the hummingbirds, which you can feed with your hands using tiny finger feeders. Hear: The beats of the largest music festival in the Caribbean atReggae Sumfest.Montego Bay hosts an annual celebration of Jamaica\u2019s signature sound every July with a who\u2019s who of reggae and dancehall acts. If you can\u2019t make it to Sunfest, Coral Cliff and Pier One host regular live reggae acts. Taste: Biteinto the flaky crust and flavorful fillings of Jamaica\u2019s signature snack atJuici Patties. The savory hand pies are sold in a range of flavors at Jamaica\u2019s largest restaurant chain. Sure, it\u2019s a chain, but this is where locals go to enjoy what are considered the best patties on the island. **Things to do for the outdoor adventurer** With a nickname like \u201cthe land of wood and water,\u201d you\u2019d expect Jamaica to supply non-stop nature activities and with an impressive array of preserves and parks, and Montego Bay definitely delivers. But there\u2019s a lot more to the island\u2019s landscape than beaches. \u201cJamaica has the Blue Mountains, which you can hike, in addition there are rivers and streams all over the interior. You can go rafting on the Rio Grande river as well as climb Dunns River falls and YS Falls,\u201d says Kingston native and airline industry expert Kerwin McKenzie ofPassrider. \u201cAnd when you\u2019re hungry, you can have some mangoes, avocados (pear) and coconut water right from the trees.\u201d Dive deeper into the terrain and explore mountains, lagoons, and the island\u2019s famous Cockpit Country. 8 am - Fortify yourself with the classic Jamaican breakfast and the national dish, ackee and saltfish atThe Pelican Grill. Head to Gloucester Avenue, also known as the Hip Strip, to chow down on the savory delights of fresh ackee (a buttery fruit) and saltfish (salted cod), served with fried dumplings at this beloved family-owned eatery that\u2019s been serving up Jamaican staples for over 50 years. 9 am - Hop a canoe toBogue Island Lagoon.Float among the shoreline mangroves of one of Montego Bay's first fishing sanctuaries. Snorkel or scuba dive to view coral reefs and rainbow-colored fish up close. Reserve a guide to help you spot pelicans, egrets, herons, and other birds. 11 am - Munch on some of the best jerk chicken in Jamaica atScotchie\u2019s. Stop by the roadside mecca of Scotchie\u2019s and feast on jerked chicken or pork, slowly grilled over sweetwood and pimento logs. Sit under the thatched roof, order sides of festivals (fried dough) breadfruit, corn, or rice and peas and prepare to be transported to foodie heaven. 1 pm - Go spelunking inCockpit Country.Follow a guide through the white limestone landscape covered in conical hillocks and sinkholes. This area was the hideout for Maroon warriors who used the area\u2019s caves and terrain as part of their guerilla warfare to defeat the British. Climb through the underground cavern system and view stalagmites and stalactites as well as underground creatures, like 10 of Jamaica\u2019s 21 resident bat species, including the Jamaican Fig-Eating bat. Trace the freshwater river system to the area\u2019s farms and interact with local farmers. 4 pm - Absorb the serenity ofAbeokuta Paradise Nature Park.Tucked into the hills just outside of Montego Bay, this under-the-radar gem honors the cultural connections between Nigeria and Jamaica. The former plantation teeming with lush greenery once reminded the enslaved laborers of Abeokta, their home in southwestern Nigeria. The Nigerian High Commissioner officially opened the park in 2003 and the grounds showcase an ancient mineral aqueduct, crotons, Alameda flowers, June plum trees, ruins from the Greathouse, and the oldest swimming pool in Jamaica. Take a dip in the Olympic-sized pool and then soak in the mineral springs while enjoying the scenic views. 7 pm - Take in ocean views and local fare at Peppa\u2019s Cool Spot.Relax with locals at this low-key eatery just above the Hip Strip. Order the oxtails or curry shrimp and unwind with the sea breeze wafting over you. 9 pm - Puff and party at the 2727 Lounge.Visit this hot spot for hookah, live dancers, and hot tunes in the middle of the Hip Strip. Located next door to a dispensary, the lounge caters to a crowd that enjoys smoking and getting loose. **Things to do for the beach bum** We get it. Sometimes you just want to experience the classics. And there\u2019s nothing more classic to a Montego Bay trip than lounging on a beach. Although all of these sandy strips of heaven share the same warm, crystalline waters, Montego Bay beaches are not one in the same. Some are geared toward music fans and partiers, some for snorkelers, and others for those of us who are just vibing. Many of Montego Bay\u2019s beaches have been privatized by resorts and hotels, so these are options that are open to the public. Some require an entrance fee, but a few are free. Whatever your preferred beach vibe, Montego Bay has you covered. 9 am - Kick off the day with a homestyle breakfast atOl\u2019 Joe.Grab a traditional light breakfast like stamp and go (saltfish fritters) or cornmeal porridge at this no-frills diner so you won\u2019t be too stuffed to dive into the water. 10 am - Start small at One Man Beach.Gear up for a day of beach traipsing by visiting the quaint One Man Beach near Gloucester Avenue. Plop on the sand and watch local kids frolic and planes zoom in from the nearby airport. This low-key beach doesn\u2019t offer any amenities but it\u2019s a great place to sunbathe and relax away from the masses. Wade through the clear waves and prime yourself for the next stop. 11:30 am - Dive into green and blue spaces atHarmony Beach Park.Enjoy the beauty of the sea and the park at the largest free public access beach park in Montego Bay. Stroll through the park's trees and gazebos, past the basketball court to a lovely stretch of beach. Amenities include umbrellas (necessary because there isn\u2019t much shade on the beach) and lounger rentals as well as changing rooms, showers and lockers. Entertain your inner child at the aqua park with water slides or just go for a swim. Harmony Beach supplies food, drinks, and ice cream vendors but there\u2019s also a KFC and Juici Patties across the street so you can eat a leisurely lunch on the beach. 2 pm - Turn up at Tropical Bliss Beach.As soon as you step up to the entrance, you\u2019ll hear reggae music blasting from the sand, setting the pace for this popular spot. There\u2019s a $5 entrance fee and the upbeat ambiance is worth it. This is literally where the action is. Jet skiing, tubing, parasailing, and glass bottom boat rides add to the party atmosphere. A restaurant and bar serves up food and drinks. But even if you came for the reggae, this spot is also good for snorkeling. Local concerts, fashion shows, and dance parties are often scheduled here but you\u2019ll want to avoid the area if there\u2019s a cruise ship in port. The crowds can be overwhelming. 4:30 pm - Catch the sunset at the most famous beach in Montego Bay.Spectacular seaside panoramas and a history of healing waters are just a couple of reasons whyDoctor\u2019s Cave Beachis legendary. Translucent waves and perfectly manicured sand make this one of the prettiest beaches in the city. There\u2019s an $8 entrance fee, changing rooms, showers, lockers, and restaurants that usually pump hip-shaking dancehall tunes. The crowds thin out by the evening so it\u2019s the perfect time to grab a fresh coconut to sip and watch the sunset over the sea. 6 pm - Head toPier One on the Waterfrontfor more seaside fun.A haven for vibrant Jamaican entertainment, this is the spot for good food and good times. Sample the whole red snapper or grilled conch while grooving to the latest reggae and pop hits. Pier One transforms into a nightclub on Friday and Saturday nights so prepare to dance the night away. If you go on a Wednesday night, you\u2019ll be treated to a local fashion show and amateur performers. **Things to do for the film buff** Scenic Jamaica has played a recognizable role in countless iconic films over the years, and Montego Bay has provided the scenic backdrop for many of the most recognizable ones. Follow the cast and crews\u2019 steps inCool Runnings,How Stella Got Her Groove Back, and the James Bond classicsDr. NoandLive and Let Diefor a cinematic island experience. Even if you don\u2019t have a Letterboxd account, these spots were chosen by location scouts over the years for good reason: They\u2019re all vibrant, gorgeous, and a perfect way to experience the beauty of MoBay. 8 am - Stop by the beloved local eateryIrie House Restaurant & Barfor breakfast.It\u2019s not a movie location but this 24-hour restaurant captures the local scene with fresh, made-to-order dishes. Order the salted mackerel and a local juice like sour sop. 10 am - Stroll the lush scenery ofCinnamon Hill Golf Courseto relive a key scene inLive and Let Die.Roger Moore encounters the elusive Baron Samedi, played by legendary actor and choreographer Geoffrey Holder, playing the flute in the middle of a cemetery in this 1973 thriller. The \u201ccemetery\u201d in the film was actually Cinnamon Hill Golf Course and a waterfall marks the location, just off the green at hole #15. Play a round on one of the best courses in Jamaica or tour the grounds of the former sugar plantation that still houses an ancient aqueduct, a sugar mill and tombstones dating back to 1726. 12 pm - Traverse the secret lair ofLive and Let Die\u2019s Dr. Kanaga atGreen Grotto Caves.An underground labyrinth covered in green algae provides the ideal home for a Bond villain and actor Yaphet Kotto made sure his character reveled in the eerie backdrop. Slide on a helmet and explore the cavern filled with bats, rock formations and a glistening underground lake. If you are a true James Bond head and want to continue your set-jetting afternoon further east from MoBay proper, you can visit the exact spot where perhaps the most iconic scene in the entire James Bond movie franchise was filmed. In 1962\u2019sDr. No, Sean Connery watches as Ursula Andress (in her role as Honey Ryder) rises from the sea atLaughing Waters Beach, shaking the water from her blonde tresses and pulling a knife from her bikini when Agent 007 startles her. Sit back on this secluded beach filled with rock pools and waving palm trees and take in the dramatic scenery. Located near the famous (and extremely crowded) Dunn\u2019s River Falls, Laughing Waters with its untouched golden sand almost feels like an alternate universe. Jamaican travel blogger and St. Andrew native Jhunelle Jureidini documents all aspects of the island on her blogSimply Local Lifeand she lists Laughing Waters as a standout experience. \u201cIt\u2019s mostly very peaceful, sitting pretty by a private estate about a two-hour scenic drive outside Montego Bay,\u201d she says. \u201cFor water lovers, it\u2019s the best of both worlds; a blend of refreshing cool from the river and rejuvenating warmth from the seawater. To me, Laughing Waters is as beautiful as it is soothing.\u201d 3 pm - Enjoy a late lunch at the headquarters of a contemporary Jamaican star.Step into the vibrant world of Jamaican eight-time gold-winning Olympian Usain Bolt\u2019sTracks & Records, a restaurant/bar/lounge bursting with Jamaican style. Enjoy dishes like coconut and cassava shrimp while the latest reggae and dancehall rhythms fill the spot. Sure, Bolt isn\u2019t a movie star, but the track and field icon might as well be\u2013he\u2019s one of the most famous Jamaicans to ever live. 5 pm - View the house that Junior Bevil calls home inCool Runnings.Head to the exclusive Tryall Club and itsThree Little Birds Villato glimpse the imposing house where Junior, played by Rawle D. Lewis, lives with his father. If you\u2019re feeling spendy, you can even rent the newly renovated four-bedroom villa and stay there yourself. 7 pm - Revel in an elegant dinner at theSeaside Terrace at the Round Hill Hotel Villas,the resort location forHow Stella Got Her Groove Back.The 1998 rom-com starring Angela Bassett and Whoopi Goldberg showcased the weary execs relaxing at the luxury resort and specifically cottage #11. Try the escovitch fish with fried green plantains. If you\u2019re lucky, you might even glimpse Donovan, the muscle-bound beach yoga instructor who played himself in the movie and still leads classes at the resort. **Where to stay** Half Moon Montego Bay ($$$)This storied resort has hosted everyone from Queen Elizabeth II to Jennifer Hudson, but it\u2019s managed to retain a freshness along with its quiet luxury. Unfolding over 400 acres of tropical beauty, including two miles of shimmery sand beach, the setting alone is worth the stay. The furnishings on the property are made from local wood and natural fibers, so a stay here feels comforting and not stuffy. That said, the equestrian center, private beach, tennis courts, and golf course still broadcast a certain degree of exclusivity. S Hotel ($$)The chic boutique hotel overlooking the famed Doctor\u2019s Cave Beach offers charm along with amenities like a sky deck and in-room record players. All-inclusive gourmet meals and a central location near shops and clubs make this a prime spot. Toby\u2019s Resort ($)Surrounded by palm trees and a tropical garden, this small family-run hotel offers convenience and a taste of local Jamaican life. Located at the beginning of the Hip Strip, Toby\u2019s is close to shops, beaches, and restaurants. The hotel provides two bars, two pools, and an on-site restaurant. **What to know before you go** **How to get around** If you\u2019re in the city center near the Hip Strip, you can walk to most restaurants, clubs, and shops. There\u2019s a public transit bus system that can take you all over MoBay and beyond but unless you\u2019re comfortable with traveling without a set schedule and are confident navigating an unfamiliar city, it\u2019s much easier (if a bit more expensive) to take taxis. Look for licensed taxis with red plates and fares for common destinations posted inside the car. Uber is also available in the city for a seamless experience. Renting a car is for the truly adventurous because traffic can be challenging and driving is on the left side of the road. **The currency** Jamaica uses the Jamaican dollar but US dollars are readily accepted in Montego Bay. You\u2019ll get the best deals using Jamaican dollars, especially in rural areas outside of the city. **International adapters you\u2019ll need** If you\u2019re traveling from the US, you won\u2019t need an adapter but you may need one if you\u2019re coming from Europe, South America, or parts of Asia. **When to plan your visit** Jamaica is blessed with balmy tropical weather all year round ranging from 80-90 degrees but hurricane season from June to November may bring occasional showers and the threat of storms. High season, from November to January and spring break (March to April) also has higher rates and crowds. **Your Montego Bay dinner party fact** Montego Bay may now be known for beach resorts but back in the day, it was most famous for wild pigs. When the Spanish landed in the area, they named it Bahia de Manteca, which means \u201cbutter bay\u201d because the region was famous for producing lard, or \u201chog\u2019s butter,\u201d from the feral porkers.
