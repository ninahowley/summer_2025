Editorial articles on this website which contain this disclosure notice: Are articles that we have written because we hope their subject will be of interest to you \u2013 they are usually about sales events, special offers, product reviews, new product launches etc that feature links to other companies websites. We have not received any payments to include any of the links, from any retailer or advertiser. Articles where this is the case are clearly labelled Advertorial or Sponsored Content. We have included them because we believe the contents of the article will be of interest to you, our readers, and that by creating engaging, relevant articles we offer value to you. We write about products or services we think you may want to buy \u2013 and if you do, in most cases, we will receive a commission from the retailer for the sale. What are affiliate schemes? Affiliate schemes enable online retailers to track the source of their sales on the internet, and pay a commission to the websites that supply them \u2013 the objective is to generate more sales for the retailer and to allow the referring website to generate their own revenue from commission. How does it work? We work with several affiliate networks \u2013 mainly Skimlinks and AWin. These networks have affiliate relationships with thousands of retailers and other publishers, and their technology enables clicks on links from our sites to retailers that result in a product being purchased to be attributed to us - we then receive a commission for this sale.
