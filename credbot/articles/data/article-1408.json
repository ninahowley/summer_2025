The adventure film has del Toro as Zsa-Zsa, a wealthy man determined to make his mission come true by recruiting millionaires to help. In preparation for the film\u2019s release, we spoke with del Toro, Michael Cera, and Mia Threapleton about the film and one of the most important parts of any Wes Anderson film: The costumes. The look of an Anderson film is part of why fans have loved his work for so long and withThe Phoenician Scheme,it really gave audiences a glimpse into why his style works so well. Whether it is the little details like a purse or binoculars or maybe a fur coat with a tennis dress, the look of a character means a lot to a Wes Anderson film. And out of all his work, I think thatThe Phoenician Schemereally highlights why the look of these characters are so important. One of my own favorite parts of the film is how Zsa-Zsa keeps getting injured and has to deal with that while trying to make a deal. But filming that couldn\u2019t be easy and during my interview, I asked del Toro about working with Zsa-Zsa\u2019s injuries and how it worked throughout filming. According to him, it ended up being a little bit of a game of trying to figure out where he was hurt in that specific moment. \u201cThere\u2019s an element of figuring out a riddle because we don\u2019t shoot in order,\u201d del Toro said about the injuries. \u201cSo the makeup department and myself, we had a board just to see, \u2018Okay, here we got this. Oh, the black eyes over here, but it\u2019s smaller over here.\u2019 So we had to keep, we have a control tower for the wounds.\u201d You can see our full interview here: The Phoenician Schemeis in theaters now!
