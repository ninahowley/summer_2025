The special circumstances charges could open up the accused shooter, Eduardo Roberto Medina-Berumen, to a possible death sentence if convicted. The charges were announced by Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman at a news conference attended by Baldwin Park police and Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s officials. Among those present was Baldwin Park police officer Anthony Pimentel, who had been shot late Saturday night and released from the hospital on Sunday. Medina-Berumen is also charged with the attempted murders of Pimentel and Baldwin Park police officer Alfredo Leal, who was not shot. The defendant, who was hospitalized after he was shot by at least one other officer, was arrested the night of the shooting, and was being held on a $4 million bail. He remained in the hospital on Tuesday. Hochman and Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna said an assault rife, two high-capacity magazines and 40-60 expended casings were recovered at the crime scene. The DA\u2019s office will decide later whether to seek capital punishment, Hochman said. In the days since the shooting, Hochman said, he met with the families of Riveros and Wong. Wong, 43, was a husband and a father of two young girls, Luna said. Investigators said they don\u2019t yet know a motive for the shooting or the exact circumstances that led to it. \u201cHe was a kind soul with so much more life ahead of him,\u201d his brother Victor Vuong, of Anaheim, wrote onGoFundMe. Wong\u2019s family asked to extend their thanks to Riveros\u2019 family for his stepping in as the shooting continued, Hochman said. \u201cWe don\u2019t need to talk about superheroes and comic book heroes,\u201d the DA said, \u201cbecause we have heroes in this exact situation.\u201d Police were initially called just after 7:10 p.m. about a man shooting a rifle in the 4200 block of Filhurst Avenue on Saturday night, said Lt. Michael Modica with the Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department. Wong was on his way to a party, Modica said. Medina-Berumen lived on the street with his mother, Modica said. At the front of the home was a sign that read \u201cNever mind the dog. Beware of owner!\u201d along with an image of a hand holding a gun. WhenRiveros and Pimentelarrived, Medina-Berumen immediately fired at them, Sheriff Robert Luna said. Riveros and Pimentel weren\u2019t able to fire back, Modica said, but he didn\u2019t specify how many other officers shot back at Medina-Berumen. After the shooting, Riveros, Pimentel and Medina-Berumen were taken to a hospital. Riveros, 35, of Pasadena, died of a gunshot wound to the head. Riveros worked for the Baldwin Park Police Department for nine years. He was on the SWAT team and became a field training officer last July. He loved snowboarding, and was an avid Dodgers fan who traveled to stadiums around the country to watch the team play, police officials said. He graduated from UC Irvine, Baldwin Park police Chief Robert Lopez said. \u201cHe was a part of our family,\u201d Lopez said, \u201cand it\u2019s hard to express what a tremendous loss this is for our department and Baldwin Park.\u201d Medina-Berumen is expected to be arraigned sometime this week, officials said. Staff writer Ruby Gonzales contributed to this report. **Related Articles** LA County sheriff\u2019s deputy wounded, robbery suspect killed in Lancaster shootout Baldwin Park shootings leave police officer and another victim dead, 2nd officer wounded CHP officer shoots woman with knife walking on 71 freeway in Chino Hills \u2018Please don\u2019t shoot me,\u2019 Fountain Valley officer pleads after suspect wrestles away her gun San Gabriel police thought driver pointed weapon at them before fatal shooting, according to video **Share this:** Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Facebook Click to share on X (Opens in new window)X Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)Reddit Click to print (Opens in new window)Print Newsroom Guidelines News Tips Contact Us Report an Error **RevContent Feed** **Most Popular** San Dimas woman accused of killing wife with sword had served victim with divorce papersSan Dimas woman accused of killing wife with sword had served victim with divorce papers **San Dimas woman accused of killing wife with sword had served victim with divorce papers** **San Dimas woman accused of killing wife with sword had served victim with divorce papers** Frito-Lay production plant, birthplace of Flamin\u2019 Hot Cheetos, closes in Rancho CucamongaFrito-Lay production plant, birthplace of Flamin\u2019 Hot Cheetos, closes in Rancho Cucamonga **Frito-Lay production plant, birthplace of Flamin\u2019 Hot Cheetos, closes in Rancho Cucamonga** **Frito-Lay production plant, birthplace of Flamin\u2019 Hot Cheetos, closes in Rancho Cucamonga** Death row inmate from Riverside County killed in prison attack; mob attacks suspectDeath row inmate from Riverside County killed in prison attack; mob attacks suspect **Death row inmate from Riverside County killed in prison attack; mob attacks suspect** **Death row inmate from Riverside County killed in prison attack; mob attacks suspect** California judge doesn\u2019t grant Gov.
