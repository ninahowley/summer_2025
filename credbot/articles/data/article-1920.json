Through publications, seminars, and scholarships, they fight to recover the American Idea\u2014I know it well\u2014by teaching about the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, the writings of Abraham Lincoln (whose bedroom is right above us). The Claremont Institute helps preserve our national traditions for generations to come.\u2014 President Donald J. Trump Claremont, CA, November 18, 2019\u2014The Claremont Institute is pleased to announce that it has been selected as a recipient of the prestigious National Humanities Medal. This high honor, bestowed by the President in consultation with the National Endowment for the Humanities, honors individuals or groups whose work has deepened the nation\u2019s understanding of the humanities, broadened citizens\u2019 engagement with the humanities, or helped preserve and expand Americans\u2019 access to important resources in the humanities. \u201cWe are humbled by this honor and grateful to President Trump and NEH Chairman Peede,\u201d said Claremont Institute President Ryan Williams. \u201cThe medal is more than anything a testament to 40 years of teaching and writing about the history and intellectual traditions of the American founding and their application to our politics today\u2014and to our teachers, students, staff, and supporters whose dedication these past four decades has been essential to our work, success, and most importantly, to promoting and defending American greatness.\u201d Along with the Claremont Institute, which is only the second think tank to ever receive this high distinction, the President recognizes educator and philanthropist Dr. Teresa Lozano Long, chef Patrick J. O\u2019Connell, and author James Patterson. Past recipients of the medal include luminaries such as Allen Bloom, Ken Burns, Tom Wolfe, Richard Peck, Thomas Sowell, Joseph Epstein, Harvey Mansfield, Victor Davis Hanson, and David McCullough. Since its founding in 1979, the Claremont Institute\u2019s mission has been to \u201crestore the principles of the American Founding to their rightful, preeminent authority in our national life.\u201d Claremont serves this mission in part through its four annual fellowship programs\u2014Publius, Lincoln, John Marshall, and Speechwriters\u2014which engage the most promising young thinkers and statesmen by examining the historical arc leading from the American Founding to today\u2019s progressivism. Alumni of these prestigious programs today total more than 700, with many now in prominent positions in government, academia, and journalism. Claremont also provides the most thoughtful intellectual debate on the right through its flagship publication theClaremont Review of Books, a journal of political thought and statesmanship, andThe American Mind, an online publication examining the ideas that drive American political life. Finally, we bring the natural law constitutionalism of the Founding to America\u2019s courts through our Center for Constitutional Jurisprudence. ###### Download logo Download media press kit We Need Your Support **Give the Gift of Freedom** Give Now Stay Connected **Sign-up for Updates** \"*\" indicates required fields \u0394 Facebook Twitter Youtube Podcast Sign-Up Donate **About** Mission & Overview Leadership & Staff Board of Directors Scholars Annual Report Press Releases Careers Contact **Publications** Claremont Review of Books American Mind Founding.com CAWL Provocations CAWL Investigative Reports American Way of Life **Centers** Center for Constitutional Jurisprudence The Center for the American Way of Life **Fellowships** Our Fellowships Publius Fellowship Lincoln Fellowship John Marshall Fellowship Speechwriters Fellowship Sheriffs Fellowship Alumni Spotlight Alumni Application Forms \u00a92025 Claremont Institute |Privacy Policy Mission & Overview Leadership & Staff Board of Directors Scholars Annual Report Press Releases Careers Contact Claremont Review of Books American Mind Founding.com CAWL Provocations CAWL Investigative Reports American Way of Life Center for Constitutional Jurisprudence The Center for the American Way of Life Our Fellowships Publius Fellowship Lincoln Fellowship John Marshall Fellowship Speechwriters Fellowship Sheriffs Fellowship Alumni Spotlight Alumni Application Forms Donate FacebookTwitterYoutubePodcast Facebook Twitter Youtube Podcast Facebook Twitter Youtube Podcast Sign-Up"}
