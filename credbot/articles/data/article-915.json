A group of DFL lawmakers protested Thursday\u2019s budget deal announcement in dramatic fashion: They pounded at the closed door of the governor\u2019s reception room midway through an otherwise triumphant press conference. Their beef: MinnesotaCare being phased out for undocumented immigrant adults. Following several instances of loud thumping coming from the door that interrupted Gov. Tim Walz and other speakers, a security guard stood at the ornate wooden double doors, which remained closed. Soon after, chants of \u201cYou\u2019ve sold out,\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t kill immigrants,\u201d and \u201cDon\u2019t kill our neighbors\u201d could be heard through the heavy wood that separated the executive office reception room from the governor\u2019s office lobby. DFL lawmakers pounded on the door of the Governor\u2019s Reception Room during the budget press conference in protest of leadership\u2019s compromise on stripping adult undocumented immigrants from state health care. \u201cOne Minnesota, right!\u201d they chanted.@kare11pic.twitter.com/VhkTEGOZdI The compromise budget hammered out by Walz and legislative leadership would stop providing access to MinnesotaCare, the state\u2019s subsidized health insurance available to low-income residents, to undocumented immigrant adults at the end of the year. The compromise would continue to provide health insurance for children who are undocumented. The move was seen as a victory for Republicans, who hold shared power with the DFL over the Minnesota House and had argued the program\u2019s costs would spiral. **Latest from the Capitol** **Minnesota lawmakers grit teeth, pass state budget in crammed special session** **Legislature, with GOP and 4 DFL votes, ends MinnesotaCare for undocumented adults** **What to know about Legislature\u2019s Monday special session to finish the budget** **Related:Health care for immigrants is a tiny part of the budget, huge talking point** Up to that point in the press conference, Walz, joined by House Speaker Lisa Demuth, R-Cold Spring, House Speaker Emerita Melissa Hortman, DFL-Brooklyn Park, and Senate Majority Leader Erin Murphy, DFL-St. Paul, had touted their success in eking out a budget compromise with only days left in the legislative session. The leaders celebrated the idea that even if national politicians were mired in party-line standoffs, Minnesota could and would get a budget passed in a bipartisan fashion \u2013 a must considering the House tie and the DFL\u2019s one-vote majority in the state Senate. But of course, a bipartisan budget requires compromises, and each leader will have to sell those compromises to their caucuses. As the scene Thursday showed, some compromises will be harder for legislators to digest than others. As the chants continued, Walz addressed the elephant in the room \u2013 or rather, right outside of it. The audible anger of his own party members showed \u201cwe still have a lot of work to do,\u201d Walz told the assembled journalists. At a separate press conference about an hour and a half later held by the People of Color and Indigenous Caucus and other DFL legislators, the chants turned into speeches decrying the proposed budget that they said would lead to people being kicked off of dialysis, losing cancer treatment, and eventually dying for lack of care. \u201cAlthough we protected the children, which is a very noble thing to do, those children will lose moms, dads, grandfathers, aunts, uncles, siblings,\u201d Rep. Cedrick Frazier, DFL-New Hope, said. Of the roughly 20,000 undocumented immigrants that the Department of Human Services says are on MinnesotaCare, about 17,000 are adults and 3,000 are children, the legislators said. Legislators and activists also said there was no financial incentive to kick undocumented immigrants off of MinnesotaCare, since these same individuals would now be a further burden on taxpayers by turning to costly emergency rooms in times of crisis instead of accessing affordable preventative care with insurance. Minnesota is one of about a dozen states that use state funds to provide health insurance to low-income residents regardless of immigration status, according to theKaiser Family Foundation. The other states are California, Connecticut, Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Utah, Vermont, and Washington, as well as the District of Columbia. A number of other states provide insurance for children but not for adults, as shown in thismapfrom the National Immigration Law Center. However, the reality of budget constraints and changing public opinion has recently led Gov. Gavin Newsom of California toreversehis long-held position that health care should be available to all state residents, regardless of immigration status. And just this week, Republicans in Congress targeted states like Minnesota in their proposed Medicaid budget. **Related:GOP\u2019s Medicaid overhaul would punish Minnesota for providing health care to undocumented immigrants** If the budget compromise passes as proposed, Minnesota will head in that direction. But as of now, its passage remains uncertain. The vociferous opposition to the MinnesotaCare compromise puts the future of the budget deal in peril. When asked if all of the representatives and senators on the stage would vote against the budget, Frazier said, \u201cI think we\u2019ve been clear at this point that it means that we\u2019re not going to vote yes on this provision.\u201d Losing the votes of the 20 DFL representatives and 10 senators in the POCI Caucus, as well as any allied legislators, would mean leaders would need to lean on Republicans for support to get the budget over the finish line. The compromise around undocumented immigrants was crucial to getting Republican buy-in for the budget, so to turn back now seems untenable for legislative leadership. **Related:After losing family member to cancer, advocate hopes new MinnesotaCare for immigrants saves lives** For some though, even the idea of kicking undocumented immigrants off of MinnesotaCare is antithetical to why they believe they were elected. It remains unclear what lengths this caucus and its supporters will go to to protect those they consider the most vulnerable Minnesotans, but it is clearly an emotional issue for many. Rep. Samakab Hussein, DFL-St. Paul, described a feeling of betrayal by party leaders. He said he has gotten hundreds of phone calls from undocumented constituents who were already concerned about their legal status and health care options prior to the budget\u2019s release. \u201cWhen they [released] this budget, I literally cried,\u201d he said.
