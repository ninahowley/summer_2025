Both earned their diplomas in SGTC\u2019s Early Childhood Care and Education program. Lakeetha Dawson and her daughter Ja\u2019layshia Daniels share more than just a close bond\u2014they share a passion for education that has brought both of them to South Georgia Technical College (SGTC) to pursue their dreams. Dawson, a Cordele native now living in Americus, first came to SGTC seeking a career that would allow her to teach and care for young children. She completed her diploma in Early Childhood Care and Education in 2015. She later earned her associate degree\u2014all while working and raising her children. \u201cIt was hard at times, juggling work, motherhood, and school,\u201d Dawson said. \u201cBut walking across that stage made it all worth it.\u201d Dawson\u2019s dedication didn\u2019t go unnoticed. Her example became a powerful influence on her daughter, Jalayshia Daniels, who graduated from Sumter County High School in 2023 and enrolled at SGTC that same year. \u201cI\u2019ve always looked up to my mom,\u201d said Daniels. \u201cSeeing her succeed made me want to follow in her footsteps\u2014she\u2019s so confident and motivated in everything she does.\u201d Now pursuing her associate degree in Early Childhood Care and Education, Daniels recently completed her internship and is preparing to take the necessary steps to become a substitute teacher. She hopes to eventually teach second grade and one day open her own daycare. Daniels also has long-term plans to continue her education and earn a specialist degree. \u201cI want to go as far as I can,\u201d she said. Dawson shares that entrepreneurial spirit. After working in a daycare facility in Cordele, she\u2019s now laying the groundwork to open her own center. \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to create something of my own\u2014to offer a nurturing space for children and give back to my community,\u201d she said. Both women credit SGTC for helping them find direction and opportunity. They were each selected for the National Technical Honor Society for their academic excellence and leadership. Daniels initially considered attending a university but was encouraged by a high school counselor to consider the technical college. She now encourages others not to overlook technical education. \u201cSGTC provides a high-quality education that can help you enter the workforce faster,\u201d said Daniels. \u201cIt offers real opportunities\u2014and for people like me who were unsure about their next step, it\u2019s a great place to grow.\u201d Dawson, meanwhile, continues to encourage her youngest child\u2014a rising high school senior\u2014to consider SGTC as well. \u201cHe\u2019s interested in welding,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m hoping he gives it a try. It\u2019s right across the street from his high school, and it could give him a great start.\u201d With two generations already graduating from SGTC and a third potentially on the way, the Dawson-Daniels family is a powerful testament to the college\u2019s impact. Their story reflects not only the strength of family, but also the opportunity and inspiration that can be found right here in Southwest Georgia.
