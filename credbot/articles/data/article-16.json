Whether you\u2019re exploring city centre, the west side or the east side, you can be sure to have the North shore mountains present as the picturesque backdrop to your adventures. As a multicultural city, Vancouverites are known for being a laidback, easy-going bunch. Just don\u2019t mention the Canucks. Events Food Things To Do **Burnaby** Neighbouring the borders of East Vancouver, Burnaby is undergoing a modern transformation that\u2019s driving a younger crowd into the city with highrise residential towers being built at a pace that exceeds even that of Vancouver\u2019s. Burnaby occupies a central area that makes it a convenient drive to get to Vancouver, New Westminster or Richmond. It\u2019s close enough to feel like you\u2019re living in Vancouver without facing any of the realities about its housing market. Events Food Things To Do **Richmond** The island city built on top of the Fraser River delta. Contrary to what the locals say, Richmond is not a city that will slide into the ocean when the Big One hits. What may be a more relevant epicentre to consider about this peaceful city is its status as the latter-day predecessor to Vancouver\u2019s historical Chinatown. Seriously, you can\u2019t go wrong with the dim sum here. Events Food Things To Do **Surrey** Not simply the fastest growing city in Metro Vancouver but also in the country, Surrey is a city that ironically gets a bad rap often from Vancouver proper, a city known for its homeless problem.
