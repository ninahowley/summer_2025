take part in immigration enforcement** Facebook LinkedIn Email As the Trump administration\u2019s immigration crackdown continues, the number of agreements between Homeland Security and local law enforcement are on the rise \u2014 including in Arizona. The 287g agreements are generally made between ICE and local law enforcement \u2014 like sheriff\u2019s offices. And it allows local entities to take part in immigration enforcement, either in jails or while serving warrants. Abillcrafted by GOP state lawmakers that would have forced local Arizona jurisdictions to be more involved in federal immigration enforcement. It was vetoed by Gov. Katie Hobbs earlier this year. Still, ICE\u2019s websiteshowseight law enforcement agencies in Arizona have agreements. Navajo and Yuma counties are the most recent additions, with Yuma joining just this month. \u201cThe 287g agreements are going to allow a vast expansion of personnel that are available to ICE or to DHS writ large to conduct immigration enforcement,\u201d said Syracuse University law professor William Banks, who specializes in military affairs. The Trump administration is asking states to provide some 21,000 National Guard troops to assist the DHS at the border and within the U.S. Those troops would be doing various deportation and detention tasks, according to reporting by NPR. Banks says if such troops are provided, it would also be in the form of a 287g agreement. But, rather than with individual counties or city police departments, it would be with the state. Yuma and Navajo counties did not respond to questions about the details of their new agreements. The ShowRadio Campensina has been on the air since the '80s.
