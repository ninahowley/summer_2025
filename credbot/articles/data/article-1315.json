Josh Shapiro\u2019s proposed budget for mass transit, which includes an allocation for River Valley Transit Authority (RVTA), would not be used in the ongoing repayment of $1.4 million in funds owed by the City of Williamsport to the Federal Transit Administration (FTA), an administrator at RVTA said. The city is repaying prior funding from the FTA due to illegality committed by a former city finance director when the city operated the former River Valley Transit, said River Valley Transit Authority Executive Director Todd Wright. \u201cThe budgeted funding in an approved budget goes to RVTA for regular operational expenses and has nothing to do with repayment to the FTA,\u201d said Wright in response to the headline of a story published by Northcentral Pa. on June 8. The headline stated: \u201cIf Shapiro\u2019s budget passes, River Valley Transit could recoup misspent funds.\u201d The story went on to connect Shapiro\u2019s budget proposal, which does have an extra $1.39 million in it for the Williamsport-based bus service, saying that is about the same amount as what the city owes the FTA. Shapiro\u2019s budget proposal for use of operational expenses at RVTA and the repayment by the city are separate issues, which Wright clarified. Additionally, the $1.39 million additional in the proposed budget could be tweaked by state legislators, he said. The repayments are a separate matter, and were agreed upon after investigation revealed federal transit grant misuse and misallocation by a former administrator, William E. Nichols Jr., 72, who is serving a year\u2019s probation after pleading guilty May 5 in Dauphin County Court on theft by failure to make required disposition of funds and tampering with public records. Currently, the state allocation in the proposed budget is $6.2 million, for RVTA which has an annual budget of $10 million, Wright said. The RVTA board has been informed by the state that current public transportation law guarantees transit agencies funding at the level of the prior year, according to Meredith Biggica, Deputy Secretary Multimodal Transportation, who provided details in a letter to Wright on March 21. In order to ensure funding will be in place at the start of the fiscal year, the department is awarding the same amount it awarded in FY 2024-25. The RVTA\u2019s Section 1513 allocation will be $6,237,634. \u201cWe will adjust your grant to include any increases after the passage of the budget,\u201d Biggica wrote to Wright. \u201cShould the Governor\u2019s Executive Budget Proposal be enacted as proposed, your allocation would increase by approximately $1,394,950.\u201d As required in Act 89 of 2013, RVTA is expected to provide local funding of $543,957, an increase of 5%, since it is not at the full 15% match. Local match may change as a result of the budget negotiations, and the state will inform the transit system of any changes to local match as a result of increases in operating funds as soon as it knows, Biggica noted. Since July 1, 2022, the RVTA board has worked directly with the authority\u2019s executive director as the title of executive director is the former general manager. The state urged RVTA to \u201cprudently manage your operating expenses\u201d to ensure future fiscal sustainability. **Newsletter** **Top News** **Top News** **Life-saving kits donated to Loyalsock Township parks, include items like AEDs and tourniquets** **Life-saving kits donated to Loyalsock Township parks, include items like AEDs and tourniquets** **\u2018The spirit of being Bulldogs\u2019: Jersey Shore Area\u2019s Class of 2025 crosses commencement stage** **\u2018The spirit of being Bulldogs\u2019: Jersey Shore Area\u2019s Class of 2025 crosses commencement stage** **Director: Proposed state allocation for River Valley Transit Authority won\u2019t pay city\u2019s debt to Federal Transit Authority** **Director: Proposed state allocation for River Valley Transit Authority won\u2019t pay city\u2019s debt to Federal Transit Authority** **Missing kayaker who drowned in Loyalsock Creek identified as South Williamsport man** **Missing kayaker who drowned in Loyalsock Creek identified as South Williamsport man** **Missing kayaker\u2019s body recovered from Loyalsock Creek** **Missing kayaker\u2019s body recovered from Loyalsock Creek** **Amazon to bring AI jobs to site near Berwick** **Amazon to bring AI jobs to site near Berwick** Gov.
