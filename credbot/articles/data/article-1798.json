During aradio interviewin February, Huq said Begum, who had her citizenship revoked, had suffered \u201ctrial by media\u201d and should have been allowed to return to the UK from Syria. This despite the fact that Begum literally stitched bombs into suicide vests to ensure they exploded when taken off during her time alongside ISIS jihadists in Syria. Begum was also a member of the \u201chisba\u201d enforcement group, which handed out brutal punishments to those found flouting ISIS laws on how to dress and behave. She also pointed an automatic weapon at women in Syria for \u201cwearing brightly colored shoes\u201d. She also said during interviews that seeing decapitated heads in trash cans didn\u2019t faze her because the victims were \u201cenemies of Islam\u201d. A d v e r t i s e m e n t While Huq is happy to see Begum return to the UK, she doesn\u2019t want the leader of the free world and the UK\u2019s number one ally to enter the country. Huq is one of several Labour MPs who have put their name to aparliamentary motionthat \u201ccalls on the Prime Minister and the Government to rescind the advice to offer a full state visit to President Trump.\u201d The reasons given include Trump not believing in man-made climate change, him being mean to London Mayor Sadiq Khan and general accusations of \u201cracism\u201d and \u201cmisogynism\u201d. Huq also said that Trump\u2019s visit would not be \u201cconducive to good race relations in this country\u201d and said granting him a parliamentary address would also send out \u201call the wrong messages\u201d.
