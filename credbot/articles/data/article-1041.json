Caregiving Hour 2** TRT: 59:40 In this hour, we look at the future of aging\u2014and why we need to act now.As America\u2019s population grows older, many communities may not be ready to meet the needs of seniors. What can individuals and local organizations do to prepare? We speak withMark Havens, executive director ofInterlinkin Lewiston, a nonprofit helping seniors and people with disabilities stay independent and in their homes. From transportation to home safety upgrades, Interlink\u2019s work\u2014and its recent research into the Lewiston-Clarkston area\u2014offers insight into what the rest of the country may soon face. Also in this episode: Rachel Sunexplores howline dancinghelps older adults stay active and socially connected. Phineas Popereports on the rise ofpickleballas a fun and healthy way to age well. Sue Anderson, associate professor at the University of Idaho, shares how we can shift the narrative around aging and better support caregivers and families. Caregiving, Premiering June 24 on PBS **Transcript of \u201cCaregiving and the Future of an Aging Population\u201d** From the campus of Washington State University in Pullman, this is an NWPB Special on Caregiving. I\u2019m Sueann Ramella. This two part series is inspired by the upcoming PBS documentary from executive producer Bradley Cooper calledCaregivingand in it Cooper shares how he rarely considered caregiving until his father\u2019s cancer diagnosis. Here\u2019s clip. Like most people, I didn\u2019t even think about caregiving until my father was diagnosed with cancer. My dad was somebody who I idolized. I used to dress up like him when I was a kid in kindergarten and get made fun of \u2019cause I wanted to wear like a suit and a tie. And then to go from that to giving him a bath is, is a, is quite a, traumatic thing. Everyone has a care story. Caring for our families is the most important and invisible work that we will ever do. Do you think we look alike? There you go. Doesn\u2019t matter who you are, where you live, what you do, where you come from. You need care. How you feeling this morning? You good? And we have this invisible army who are essentially holding us all up as families and therefore holding the entire economy up. I have reintroduced a credit for caring. Bill Fit is for those that are caring for their loved ones. We are trapped in a caregiving crisis within an economic crisis within a healthcare crisis. Now we have a once in a generation opportunity to support all of our families and our caregivers too. It really is up to us. All of us can help raise the banner for caregivers. That\u2019s why I\u2019m excited to partner with WETA and produce this documentary together. With your help, we can make a difference. Ramella: And what you just heard was a clip from the upcoming PBS documentary calledCaregivingby executive producer Bradley Cooper, which starts streaming May 27th and will be on TV June 24th on PBS channels. We had a chance to speak with leaders in the caregiving world. Yesterday\u2019s conversation focused on resources and experiences of caregivers. We learned that many people don\u2019t identify as caregivers because they are simply taking care of their family and friends. But without self-identifying as a caregiver, they may be missing out on some resources to help them better care for themselves so they in turn can care for their family and friends. You can listen to hour 1 at nwpb.org. Today\u2019s conversation is about our aging population and how there may not be enough help for them if we don\u2019t plan now, and what can individuals and communities do? We spoke with Mark Havens, the executive director of Interlink in Lewiston. Interlink is a nonprofit organization with a mission to help senior citizens and people with disabilities remain independent and in their own home. They transport clients and do safety modifications in homes. Interlink also did research into the census of the Lewiston and Clarkson population. Mark Havens has a lot to share about what they discovered and how the Lewis Clark Valley can be a harbinger for the rest of the nation. Mark: Yes. Interlink started the population project, which later became the aging project three years ago in 2022 when the census data from the 2020 census became available, and by digging into the data for both Nez Perce County, Idaho and Asotin County, Washington where Lewiston and Clarkston are, we found out that that metropolitan area is the oldest population, urban population center, in the entire Pacific Northwest as measured by median age and percent of the population over age 65. By those measures, we match Florida. We are the Florida of the northwest. Ramella: And when you discovered this in the data, what are some thoughts that came to mind? Mark: We did this at the direction of our board of directors, and when we shared the information with them, they said, we are not going to be large enough as an organization to serve the needs of such a ballooning population. Because this is mainly baby boomers retiring. And that\u2019s gonna continue for another decade. Uh, so they directed me to take the data to the public and initiate a community conversation on what are we going to do. So Interlink hosted nine community forums. We called them Senior Summits, between April of 2022 and May of 2024 last year, about every three months. We like the rest of the country, have the baby boomers retiring in vast numbers. That\u2019s been predicted for 30 years or more. Started with people born in 1946 who turned 65 in 2011, and it\u2019s going to continue to the end of this decade and probably a few more years, for this bubble known as the Baby Boomers all passing over age 65. But in addition to that Lewiston and Clarkston have been discovered as a great retirement, mecca because of our low cost of living, low crime rate, beautiful weather, medical facilities and recreational activities. So, hundreds and hundreds of retirees are moving into the Lewis Clark Valley every year, but they don\u2019t bring their families. So these are senior citizens who don\u2019t necessarily have children or relatives or even friends living around them when they need help. Ramella: Many people look forward to an active retirement, so they\u2019re not thinking that they\u2019ll age, slow down, or maybe become disabled. So they may not be thinking about support services, but there may not be enough help. Mark: That\u2019s precisely true. People who have a spouse, have children who live locally, have friends, maybe belong to a faith community and know people there. Of course have financial resources. They don\u2019t often need to reach out to the general public or the government for assistance. They have everything they need if they reach the age or infirmity for help. It\u2019s people who don\u2019t have those things. Don\u2019t have a spouse, don\u2019t have children, don\u2019t have friends, don\u2019t belong to a faith community. Maybe lack financial resources to hire those things. If they live alone we have labeled them \u2018solo seniors.\u2019 And so while there\u2019s over 15,000 people in the Lewis Clark Valley over age 65, we estimate that about three to 5,000 of them, so from 20% to one third of them are solo seniors living alone, no family to assist them. It is true that many people don\u2019t recognize their own decline or don\u2019t think they will decline, and so they\u2019re not making plans ahead for those stages of life. And so then when something happens, physical or mental developing, memory loss, or emotional developing depression, whatever it might be, they don\u2019t have a plan in place. And we call those seniors in crisis. And when you asked who would they call, what would they do? Well, there is one thing that everyone knows, they dial 9-1-1, and we have heard from the fire departments and EMTs, emergency medical technicians from both communities \u2013 both states and counties \u2013 they are overwhelmed with phone calls. Predominantly from senior citizens who don\u2019t have life-threatening issues and don\u2019t need to be transported to the hospital. They just need someone to come and lift them off the floor if they fall or get them unstuck, get them out of their recliner. If they can\u2019t get out of a recliner or move something heavy for them, or just things that neighbors help neighbors with, and they have no one to call except 9-1-1. Now this is an issue for all of us. Those kind of calls are reaching the point of almost 50%. Keep in mind when you yourself may have a life-threatening condition and you need EMT and an ambulance, they may be out helping an older person for a task that is not life threatening and not an emergency. That is why this is a community problem. Ramella: What can community leaders and organizations do about this? Mark: During our community meetings at which over a hundred people participated, both nonprofits for-profits and people from government, we were talking, we would examine the data. And then talk about the implications of the data and how do we prepare for it. The discussion table focused on senior health came back with a report and this was just our third community forum, and they said, our valley cannot grow out of this. We will never be able to hire enough caregivers, hire enough EMTs, have enough beds in assisted living nursing homes and hospitals for this burgeoning number. We have to focus on prevention, which means we have to focus on senior health. The goal needs to be, and our group adopted this as a goal, to keep as many senior citizens as possible as healthy as possible as long as possible so they won\u2019t overtax the system \u2013 the healthcare infrastructure system, and ultimately Medicare, Medicaid. You know the financial system, which underpins all of this. And so we\u2019ve been doing a lot of work and study how to keep senior citizens healthy which is an antidote to caregiving. If future senior citizens were to consume healthcare and and caregiving resources at the same rate as current senior citizens, it will bankrupt the system. We will not have enough workers and it will cost too much money. So that\u2019s what that study table came to. That conclusion of there really is no other choice if you want your community to remain vibrant and not overtax your healthcare system which would affect every one of every age. So there\u2019s no way to hire or build our way out of this. Well, wages in the Lewis Clark Valley aren\u2019t necessarily the the highest around, but they have been going up for nurses and caregivers because they need to match Spokane. Some agencies say they even match Seattle wages, but the feeling was you can\u2019t grow your way out of it. One way would be to look overseas for foreign nurses and caregivers. Our valley doesn\u2019t have a great history in bringing in foreign workers as much as other places do, but I think we\u2019re going to have to do that. Family members are going to maybe have to play a more active role than they did before. But now I\u2019m back to the question. What of those who don\u2019t have family members who will be helping them? Ramella: You mention couples come and retire without bringing their families to a new area, but maybe one of the spouses dies and then you are left with a solo senior. Why aren\u2019t people bringing their families? Mark: It\u2019s the same reason people move to Florida from the Northeast or the New York area. They wanna go in their retirement where they enjoy the weather and they enjoy the activities and to be around other senior citizens. But they\u2019re not necessarily thinking ahead. Their family will visit them, and Florida has the infrastructure for senior citizens. So it\u2019s already built up. Um, anticipating this no part of the Northwest does because we\u2019re one of the younger parts, the, the four states in the northwest we\u2019re one of the younger parts of the entire country. But the Lewis Clark Valley is an island of senior citizens in an ocean of younger people. So this infrastructure or this strategy of keeping older people healthy needs to be introduced here first. Interlink has this goal to keep seniors healthy. How are you going about that? We\u2019ve developed a second plan called the Senior Health Initiative, or we\u2019re actually calling it the Gold Plan. The Gold Plan identifying activities and programs that are either in place or should be put in place to keep senior citizens healthy in what are called the seven pillars of health. And people in healthcare know what these are. So it\u2019s not only physical health. The seven pillars are physical health, mental health, social health, because people with friends and social contacts live longer and are healthier. Spiritual health, intellectual health, which is different than mental health, keeping your mind active and your intellect. Financial health, which is very important, especially helping seniors avoid scams, financial scams, and environmental health, which is your surroundings both inside your home. Because many seniors are living in unsafe homes with a lot of stairs and no railings, but also in your community. And we ask seniors in my organization, we will ask them, what can the community do to be safer? And more welcoming to senior citizens when you\u2019re out and about. We all know about wheelchair ramps, at curb cuts, excuse me, curb cuts, at intersections. But there\u2019s so many other ways that a community can be senior friendly, starting with how much strength does it take to open the door to the pharmacy or to a beauty parlor. Thos just can\u2019t be opened by someone with limited strength. Ramella: Oh, Mark, I didn\u2019t even think about that. Mark: So those are the seven pillars of health, and we have identified activities under all of them that our community could introduce and many we already have. We just need to expand them. Another reason for this burgeoning. elderly population and concern about caregiving is because this generation, the Baby Boomer generation that is aging, had fewer children than the generations before that those people may remember taking care of their elderly parents who passed on, but they probably had numerous brothers and sisters to help them. This generation, the Baby Boomers, who are moving into senior retirement may have had only one or two children, and those children may live far away, not necessarily locally. So right off the bat, you have fewer children to help. Even if they wanted to help, they may not live locally or they\u2019re overwhelmed because there may be only one of them and only child or two of them. So that\u2019s another reason for the caregiver crisis in this country. I think the focus on senior health is going to have to become a national priority, but of course, we are seeking grants for the Lewis Clark Valley to be a laboratory to try to experiment with some of these initiatives because people of that age, and I will be one of them soon, they\u2019re going to be there whether we like it or not. It\u2019s to our benefit to help people help themselves stay healthy. So that\u2019s important. The other things are technology, adaptive equipment, robotics may assist, some retirees at home. There are such things called a smart home with technologies that will alert people if you fall on the floor or, help you in the kitchen, things like that. Quite frankly, we need to look to Japan and Korea, South Korea, whose population is far more elderly than us and they have a much more challenging, future before them. And what are they doing to face it? We can learn a lot from other countries. Ramella: You are listening to an NWPB special on caregiving. I\u2019m Sueann Ramella. Staying active is one of the pillars of health that Mark mentioned. You\u2019ll hear more from Mark from Interlink in a moment. First, NWPB\u2019s Phineas Pope has a story about one popular activity to help everyone be active. Pickleball. Phineas Pope Report: Pickleball on a Thursday morning at the Hamilton Indoor Recreation Center in Moscow, Idaho. Pickle ballers are playing doubles. Jim Craig is one of the players. He says he thinks people are drawn to the sport because all you have to do is show up and play. Unlike some other sports that require more planning, he puts it this way. We\u2019re a bunch of old people. We all get together. We play, we get tired. We go sit in the stands and we rest, and we tell each other all our medical problems. He says, that\u2019s not quite a joke. Heather Nelson got into the sport after trying it out at a friend\u2019s birthday party. She says it\u2019s one of the ways she likes to stay active, usually playing three times a week for a few hours. It\u2019s fun, it\u2019s social, you know, and there\u2019s something about the, you know, the PPO that\u2019s kinda like at a pop rocks or something like that. Nelson said, if you\u2019re interested, find someone to teach you the basic rules of the game, which are not that hard. And even if you come as a complete novice to the Moscow Rec Center, there\u2019s typically a beginner\u2019s court set up. It\u2019s can be addictive. So, you know, that\u2019s good. In a good way. Yeah, in a good way. That\u2019s a good way. Sherry LaFave was another pickle baller on the court. She said, coming from tennis, it was a little hard to understand the scoring. If you\u2019re thinking pickleball is just like tennis. LaFave says it\u2019s a lot easier than tennis. It\u2019s just less running and the racket\u2019s not as heavy. The ball\u2019s easier to hit, you know, the little waffle ball. So it\u2019s nice and light. And while may be easier than tennis studies have shown that pickleball can have positive effects on mental health and of course physical health. It\u2019s good exercise. Yeah. Yeah. I\u2019ve got my. Stepper here going. So it\u2019s a good 5,000 steps. I usually play a couple hours and lava\u2019s advice if you\u2019re still on the fence about pickleball, it\u2019s always intimidating to learn a new sport, but I mean, you gotta start somewhere, right? Everyone, everyone starts the same. Everyone\u2019s a beginner at one point in their life, so you just gotta go for it. In Moscow. I\u2019m Phineas Pope. Ramella: That was NWPB\u2019s Phineas Pope, you\u2019re listening to a special on Caregiving, and our guest is Mark Havens from Interlink in Lewiston and Clarkston says, keeping seniors healthy for as long as possible could help lessen the burden on the caregiving industry, or at least postpone your need for caregiving services. Here\u2019s Mark, again, speaking on the pickleball piece. Mark: I think when talking about physical activities it\u2019s important for a community to divide ideas and activities into categories, and then provide a some of each. So what you have there with pickleball is a group activity, not a solo activity and a competitive activity, right? People win the game, and some people are very competitive and some people are not competitive. So the analogy would be the difference if playing cards, the difference between solitaire, playing solitaire by yourself. Non-competitive and playing bridge or pinnacle with other people and you are competitive. It depends on the individual and there should be something for everyone for the individual. For many years in the Lewis Clark Valley, we hosted the Idaho Senior Olympics, so you had Olympic level competition again. For the competitive, running weightlifting, a number of different things, obviously that had to stop with COVID-19. So that activity stopped, and the nonprofit organization that used to put it on and host it has chosen not to revive it, someone else could. It takes a lot of work, but it was also a fundraising event. So it raised money. But once again, I think you need to speak to senior citizens of both genders and every age. Are you competitive? Do you want to try your skill against somebody else, or would you rather engage in an activity that is not competitive but is social, or buy a dog and walk the dog. That\u2019s exercise. Ramella: Now NWPB\u2019s Rachel Sun has another activity to report on \u2013 line dancing. Rachel Sun Report: At the Sixth Street Senior Center in Clarkston, Pam Moore is teaching a dance class, step back and rock and do a right shuffle, left pivot. As she moves. She talks through each step while her class stands at attention watching swivel, stomp tap and swivel. And More says she first began instructing line dancing classes about 10 years ago. I love music and I\u2019ve always enjoyed dancing, and I don\u2019t sing well, so this is a wonderful way for me to get to enjoy music and get exercise, and I just love it. Longtime line dancers, like 84-year-old Maya Rodriguez, pick up the steps quickly, but she says she wasn\u2019t always as good as she is now we are showing the young ones that you can do it even if you\u2019re 80. If you had asked me three years ago or when I started, I would not have been able to do it either. Rodriguez says she likes the camaraderie, the dancing helps keep her mind and body active. I am Rachel Sun in Clarkston. Ramella: That was NWPB\u2019s Rachel\u2019s Sun reporting on line dancing. Let\u2019s return to our guest Mark Havens from Interlink. Ramella: So, there\u2019s another story about being active this time of social one. Do you see these types of activities for seniors or others that are easily accessible recreation in the Lewis Clark Valley? Mark: Yes, all of that. And we need a lot more. The problem is that the number and percentage of senior citizens retirees taking advantage of these programs is very low. We need to. Courage more and to have more opportunities on different days, different times On the subject of dancing. Many people find walking boring. They don\u2019t wanna walk. So if you don\u2019t wanna walk, you should dance. The trifecta of dancing once again to use that horse racing term is square dancing, and we used to have a lot of square-dancing groups in the valley, and we have fewer now, but square-dancing involves physical activity, mental stimulation and learning because you have to learn the steps and trace the patterns on the floor. And socializing because you are so doing it with a large group of people, not just a single partner, but a large group of people. Now, line dancing is a great idea because you remove the partner element of it and. Okay, let\u2019s just face it. At a certain age, there\u2019s not enough men for every woman. Women live longer, and so they can\u2019t always count on a dance partner line dancing is ideal. You talked about rugged individualism. We at Interlink are just starting to recognize this issue that many seniors may be resistant to some of these initiatives. They don\u2019t think they need help, or they don\u2019t want to do exercises or do do these other activities to improve their health because they simply don\u2019t want people telling them what to do. They don\u2019t want their keys taken away. They feel that they\u2019ve reached a stage of life that no one can tell them what to do. So how do you overcome that mindset, which may be all across the country? But it might be more prevalent in the Pacific Northwest where people pride themselves on being individuals. We\u2019re going to work on sending this message about senior health, that you do it for yourself and you do it for your family, and you do it for your community, and you do it for your country. It is an act of patriotism to maintain your health, whether it\u2019s to take yoga classes or Tai Chi classes or make sure you\u2019re getting adequate nutrition. It is an act of patriotism to do that, so you don\u2019t become a burden to your family, to your community, and to Medicare. So that\u2019s one thing because that age group has a strong sense of patriotism, strong sense of loyalty to the country. If we can make them understand you\u2019re doing it for more than just yourself. The second very important thing is to do things in community, to do things in groups. I hear messages over and over and over again that walking is the best exercise, which it is, and everyone should walk more, but especially senior citizens. You need to walk more, walk a little bit every day. I heard the statistic recently, walking 15 minutes a day as a senior citizen in your sixties and seventies is likely to add three and a half years to your life. That\u2019s phenomenal. But nobody likes to walk alone. Most people don\u2019t. Maybe you\u2019re an introvert, maybe you\u2019re walking your dog, but most people don\u2019t like to walk alone. So we\u2019re exploring the idea of not just setting up teams of people because again, maybe these people don\u2019t have friends. But setting up walking clubs. Walking clubs with a team leader who will design courses for people of about equal abilities to walk and talk. So this is being done in large cities. Why can\u2019t it be done in places like Lewiston and Clarkston and other places here in the northwest? It actually is the trifecta of health. It is physical, it is mental, and it is social. To get people walking in groups. Heck, you could even name your team and have t-shirts. But I think we have to recognize that we can\u2019t just lecture senior citizens to exercise or do other things individually unless we\u2019re prepared to create teams so they can do it communally, which is more motivational and more enjoyable for all of us. The documentary on caregiving that Bradley Cooper produced\u2026 I\u2019m not sure if he uses the word crisis, but if it\u2019s not a crisis now, it soon will be. There\u2019s massively growing numbers of senior citizens and the percentage who will require caregiving because on top of everything else that I\u2019ve told you, Sueann, people are living longer. So the longer you live, the more likely you will need caregiving. I will give you those statistics. The statistics are on average\u2026before death, 42% of men will require caregiving. Sometimes even in a facility. 58% of women will require caregiving also, possibly in a facility, and that is because women live longer than men. So those are, those are the numbers, but the sheer quantity of people in those percentages is going to get larger and larger and larger. There aren\u2019t enough people going into the caregiving professions due to low pay or low prestige. And according to that documentary, if a lot of burden falls on family members, do people, predominantly women, want to leave their careers in their forties and fifties when they\u2019re may be at the peak of their earning potential to care for an elderly relative? That would be a huge loss to our economy and our society, and that\u2019s why I would consider it a crisis. The ripple effects of a rapidly aging population needing care from a decreasing labor force, size of labor force creates a top heavy scenario as is already happening in Japan and Korea and some other countries, including in Europe. And this needs to be resolved before it becomes a crisis through many of the ideas that I\u2019ve already expressed. Ramella: This is a special on caregiving. I\u2019m Sueann Ramella with Northwest Public Broadcasting. Let me reintroduce our guest. Mark Havens Executive Director from Interlink in Lewiston, an organization that assists seniors and the disabled live independently in their homes. They provide transportation services and help build accessibility structures like wheelchair ramps for homes. To overview what Mark has said so far, the Lewiston Clarkston area is like the Florida of the Northwest, but without the infrastructure to sustain the retirees that are moving to the area care services like hospitals, retirement homes, and organizations like his will not be able to meet the caregiving demands of an aging Baby Boomer population. And that is why Interlink has an additional goal to keep seniors as healthy for as long as possible so they can delay their caregiving needs and that everyone will eventually need some level of care. Another important thing everyone can do is to prepare for their death. Mark: It\u2019s really important for people to plan ahead for their later years in life in every way possible when they might need help. And then also if the medical problems really start to compound, and most people know about things like living wills, advanced directives, naming people as power of attorney when they can\u2019t make their own decisions. And I would place all those in end of life. The end of life. And so many Americans, we don\u2019t wanna talk about that. We don\u2019t wanna talk about death. The elderly people don\u2019t wanna talk about it. Their middle-aged children don\u2019t wanna talk about it. Although you\u2019d be surprised at the number of elderly people who will talk about it. So I think the entryway into those conversations and that planning are things that don\u2019t necessarily point toward death, just point toward assistance. So what sort of housing are you living in or is your mother or father living in, is it safe? Is it well maintained? The day will come when they can\u2019t mow the lawn themselves. They can\u2019t keep up with yard work. Maybe they can\u2019t keep up with home maintenance, the roof or painting. Who\u2019s going to step in and help? Is that a plan that children or neighbors or friends can plan for? What about meal preparation? So many seniors don\u2019t get adequate nutrition, and that\u2019s why there\u2019s a lot of senior meal programs, but they may not know that they\u2019re not getting nutrition, or they may decide they\u2019re tired of cooking. So you may want to explore what are the senior meal options in your community. Driving is a huge one. At some point, everyone needs to give up the keys to a vehicle. I have those statistics \u2013 according to AARP the average age that Americans quit driving is age 85, and they also say that\u2019s about seven years later than they should be. So let\u2019s assume that we need to have people stop driving sometime between their late seventies and their mid eighties. What\u2019s the alternative? I think the reason that so many senior citizens continue to drive here in the Pacific Northwest is because public transportation options are so limited or non-existent, especially in rural areas. So that\u2019s an area for public policy. Take your pick. Do you want elderly, unsafe drivers on our city streets and at highways, or do we wanna provide alternatives? And so organizations like Interlink are able to pick up the slack as well as. City transit and dial aide services and other kinds of services, but talk to your aging parents about driving and when they might quit driving and what the alternatives are before something bad happens. Ramella: And what about the person giving the care? How can we help them? Mark: It\u2019s important to have a care plan for the caregiver so that they have breaks and they don\u2019t burn out. First of all, there is an old cliche regarding caregiving. Everybody falls into one of four categories. You either have been a caregiver, are currently a caregiver, will be a caregiver in the future, or will be someone in need of caregiving. And some people fall into more than one of those categories. The important thing to remember, and I learned this when I worked at the Alzheimer\u2019s Association some years ago, 40% of caregivers pre-deceased the person that they are providing care for. Now, that\u2019s usually a spouse. A spouse caring for another spouse who has physical or memory challenges, but they will predecease that spouse possibly due to overwork. You need to have a plan B. What would happen in that case and who would become the new caregiver, but also take care of your own health? And one of the greatest needs that communities all over need is an adult daycare program or day health program. That\u2019s not only beneficial for the elderly person who needs supervision, but it\u2019s beneficial to the caregiver who needs a few hours of break, to run errands or go get a massage and look after themselves. Here in Pullman, you have a wonderful program called Circles of Caring Adult Day Health. It\u2019s the only one in this entire area. We don\u2019t have one in Lewiston, Clarkston, but I can highly recommend them and we need those adult day health programs. They don\u2019t have to operate 24 hours a day or even seven days a week, even a few days a week, just a few days a week could make a big difference to the families that have a care partner and a person receiving care. And there are government funds available to pay for those kind of programs. Ramella: Speaking of federal funding, how is interlink funded? Mark: Interlink is funded by a combination of some government funds, some foundation funds, competitive grants that we write for, and corporate and individual donations. So it really is a big mix of funding sources and we appreciate all of them. Regarding the government funds, they are not currently at risk. That could all always change, of course, but one of the benefits of having such a large group of the population moving into retirement is they exert a lot of political clout. And it\u2019s no secret that AARP is the largest lobbying organization and nonprofit organization in the country. Senior citizens also vote at much higher rates than younger people. So any elected official would really need to think twice about going after programs that benefit senior citizens because of the potential political effect. Likewise, senior citizens might want to really question elected officials and candidates on this issue because. It is absolutely guaranteed that if certain kinds of money disappeared, those programs will disappear. There are not alternative sources of funds to keep such programs alive. Governmental funding to a certain degree is important for all of those programs, and it\u2019s something we need to be vigilant about. You know, I can\u2019t quote you a percentage of our budget because it, it changes, as things arise. So just two weeks ago we got our contract for government funding to extend transportation services to the rural parts of Nez Perce County, Lapwai, and some unincorporated areas that even don\u2019t have a name to provide transportation to bring people in those areas into the city for medical appointments and other needs. And those are people who don\u2019t drive, and we haven\u2019t been able to afford to extend services so far outside city limits. But that\u2019s a grant of about $127,000. That\u2019s good for 18 months, a year and a half of this service. We\u2019re thrilled to have it, and we would not have started such a program without such government funding. So government, local, state and national have a huge role to play and it is to their benefit to support seniors and to keep them healthy, which will keep Medicare healthy. Ramella: Mark Havens of interlink, thank you for speaking with us. Do you have any final thoughts to share with people moving into our area or throughout? Mark: People aren\u2019t getting connected to their community if they\u2019re not joining a church, a temple, a synagogue. If they\u2019re not joining athletic groups, if they\u2019re not meeting their neighbors, they\u2019re not joining line dancing social groups. Then who\u2019s going to help them? It\u2019s not unrealistic to think, that\u2019s why they call 9-1-1. That\u2019s why they turned to the government for programs. But we don\u2019t have the programs that people from larger and wealthier areas have because those services are provided by families and friends, which the moving in retirees don\u2019t have. And that is the scenario that all of us as a community are going to have to figure out how to address both government, non-profit and for-profit. How do we help these people? We can\u2019t just say move back home. There\u2019s been a lot of studies about the difficulty and challenges of people in their older years to make friends \u2013 shyness, existing seniors belong to cliques and clubs and are suspicious of outsiders, or maybe physical health needs or monetary limitations. Not everyone can join the country club, but it does take a certain personality to reach out and conquer your shyness and not be an introvert and meet other people. And like with pickleball. Invite people to join you. All of us have activities that we could make new friends if we just invited people, and churches should be doing more evangelizing and social clubs and activity groups should be doing more outreach to invite people come and come with a friend. And recognize that this age group is not all connected to Facebook and social media or even use the internet at all. You are not going to reach them. You\u2019ll reach a part portion of them, and 20 years from now, you might reach all of them, but currently you need to rely on more traditional media of radio and newspaper and television to reach these individuals. Ramella: We were speaking with Mark Havens of Interlink that serves the Lewiston and Clarkston Valley. All this talk about caregiving and an aging population may make some listeners think that they\u2019re off the hook, but younger folks, not yet in retirement, there\u2019s news for you too. University of Idaho Associate Professor and Associate Director of Program Development, Sue Anderson says no matter your age, you need to make health bank deposits for your future self. Sue Anderson: I think we\u2019re all kind of familiar with the idea of banking and our bodies and our health really are the most important bank that we have. So everything that we do when we\u2019re younger. Just decisions we make about how we live. Do we stay active? Are we still moving? What is our diet like? What are we doing in our lifestyles that fills our bank of health? Ramella: The month of May is older Americans month, and this year\u2019s theme is Flip the Script on Aging, focusing on transforming how society perceives talks about and approaches aging. It encourages individuals and communities to challenge stereotypes and dispel misconceptions. Dr. Anderson encourages everyone to realize that growing older is not a guarantee. Sue Anderson: Aging is not guaranteed. It\u2019s really a blessing. Every candle that you put on your birthday cake is really a blessing. You\u2019ve made it another year. Don\u2019t be afraid to age, but look forward and be as healthy as I can. That\u2019s really the paradigm shift. You know, the other thing that I see in the culture right now, it\u2019s this \u2018Hey, Boomer\u2019 mentality. It\u2019s a negative viewpoint of older people. Really older people have a lot to offer. There\u2019s a lot of experience, these negative social context of aging. It hurts the older people and I think it younger people miss out on a lot of learning and love that they could experience. Ramella: Dr. Anderson helped design a master\u2019s degree in gerontology at the U of I, and why seek this type of degree? Sue Anderson: So this master\u2019s degree was designed for everyone. To really kind of enhance their profession with a focus on gerontology. The older population is growing. It\u2019s a ripe industry for service types of needs. Anyone who\u2019s got any kind of entrepreneurial aspirations, this master\u2019s degree would be a perfect fit for them. I think a lot of people think that getting a degree in gerontology is really for healthcare providers, but then even engineering students because you know, older people sometimes needed adaptive devices or they need adaptations in their home where they live, and they said all of that would need an engineer. Ramella: No matter your age or the age of your loved ones, it\u2019s important to begin the conversation about how to care for you as you age, but how to start that conversation. Dr. Anderson has this advice. Sue Anderson: Take a deep breath, honestly. Look at those candles on your cake and know that something\u2019s going to happen at some point. I encourage everyone to have an advanced directive and have a healthcare power of attorney and have really frank conversations. None of us wants to develop dementia or Alzheimer\u2019s or heart disease, but we know that if we\u2019re blessed to live long enough, this may happen and it\u2019s better that your family knows ahead of time what your wishes are. Ramella: And Dr. Anderson offers this encouragement to those who are caregivers. Dr. Anderson: Caregiving is a 24-7 job and there are so many emotions involved with caregiving and there\u2019s so much uncertainty along the the path of, am I doing the right thing, is what I\u2019m seeing, what\u2019s really happening? And I think the biggest thing I can say for caregivers is to be kind to yourself. My own mom, you know, I carried the guilt of getting rid of her stuff and putting her in a nursing home, you know? And it\u2019s that being kind to yourself and realizing life isn\u2019t always easy, but when you make a decision that really is for the best of the person, forgive yourself. Get help. Don\u2019t be afraid to reach out. There are a lot of agencies that will help. Never feel like you\u2019re alone. Ramella: That was University of Idaho Associate Professor Sue Anderson. Before we end this special on caregiving, a shout out to you if you are caring for your family and friends, or if you are a paid caregiver helping your community members. Visiting Angels is an organization that gives out the caregiver of the Year award and Marty Lusby in the Tri-Cities. Is a semi-finalist for the award. NWPB\u2019s Phineas Pope talked with Lusby about her experience. Pope: What keeps you passionate about this work day after day? Lusby: I love caregiving. I love to do what I do, and it\u2019s just awesome to be recognized for something that I love to do. So when you get up to go to work every morning and it\u2019s caregiving, it\u2019s great. Um, I get to bring the world. To people who are maybe a shut in. Um, I, you know, sometimes we have people that can\u2019t see very well and we read to them, or believe it or not, some of us sing to them, not me, because I\u2019m not a good singer, but some of them do. Pope: Can you tell me about your first experience as a caregiver? What drew you to this? Lusby: Originally when my kids got older and they left home, I needed something to do and it was either gonna be caregiving or childcare. Well, I\u2019ve done childcare for many, many years, so I was like, let, lemme go see what\u2019s going on with caregiving. And so I started with my very first client and she was a, she was just such a charm and my first job was to just go in and visit with her. She was lonely as a lot of elderly people get, you know, they become home bound and they become lonely. She was just lonely and we just had a great time. We\u2019d go, go and just visit and I\u2019d make her her breakfast because she was unable to do that and her family was busy, so I\u2019d make her breakfast and, it just became something that I was real comfortable with. It\u2019s something that I enjoyed and it\u2019s like, what the heck? I stayed with it. Phineas: How did caring for your own family members growing up shape your approach to what you\u2019re doing now? Lusby: My grandparents raised me, and so a lot of it was at that time I was very young and I actually learned how to give an insulin shot as an 8-year-old. So it was a lot of things and then a lot of it was they couldn\u2019t hear well. So they\u2019re always saying, stand up, speak to me, look at me. And so that\u2019s one of the things that, you know, when I go to a lot of clients\u2019 houses, you know, you gotta make sure that they\u2019re hearing you, make sure that they\u2019re seeing you so that they know where you are. And yeah, my grandparents were older of course, and it help me do this honey and help me do that. And so you kind of learn, I guess when you\u2019re really young and you\u2019re taking care of someone, you kind of learn those little things. Pope: Can you talk about what sort of challenges you\u2019re facing right now, either you individually in your work or visiting angels? Lusby: Largely, sometimes the hard part about caregiving too is, you know, a lot of times we\u2019re with people that are really ill and they pass away and it hurts. I mean, as a caregiver it hurts because especially if you\u2019ve been with them for a while. And you know about them, and then you get to know their families and it\u2019s just, yeah, it, that\u2019s the biggest challenge in caregiving for me is when I have to let go. Pope: How do you deal with that? Lusby: Our company gives us a lot of support, a lot of grief support, you know, and that\u2019s just something great. And I think that, you know, it\u2019s a good thing to have. Sometimes it helps to just stand back and not have a client for a couple weeks or a couple months or however long it takes, and then get back in there because when you\u2019re not there, you miss it. So you know, you need to get back there so that you can have that feeling again, I guess I should say. Phineas: Why do you think you enjoy this work? Lusby: It\u2019s rewarding. I get to help people help themselves. Pope: Well, when you say it\u2019s rewarding, does anything in particular come to mind? Lusby: One time I had a lady and she had several different caregivers, and so when I would come in, I go, oh, look, it\u2019s me again. Aren\u2019t you lucky? And she looked at me, she goes, oh yes, I am lucky it\u2019s you. She goes, I like it when you\u2019re here because you help me with everything that I need to do. And you don\u2019t even ask dumb questions, so, so yeah. Um, when you get to know your clients, you kind of know what they, how they want things, and it\u2019s like, oh yeah. It\u2019s quite rewarding when you know you can be that person. And then again, when the family say, oh, thank you so much, what, you know, with the help that you\u2019ve done for my mom or my dad, or whatever, and I\u2019ve had several of those. Pope: I\u2019ve read that you make flower bouquets and bring homemade meals. Lusby: Yes. Pope: What inspires you to go the extra mile? Lusby: Well, isn\u2019t it just something everybody does? I don\u2019t know, maybe it\u2019s not something everybody does. It just puts a smile on their face, when I can say, oh look, I made this for dinner last night and it was so good. I had to bring you some. It\u2019s like, oh, okay. This is great. And sometimes it\u2019s like, yeah, that was good. And, go through recipes with them and it just opens up a whole conversation to what I can bake for them or what I can cook for them. And the flour arrangements are awesome. I had a lady that could no longer get out of bed and she had beautiful flowers outside and she said, oh, I can\u2019t see my flowers anymore. I wanna see my flowers. So I went outside and picked her this big bouquet and I was with her every Monday. So every Monday morning when I came in, I would bring her a fresh flowers from her own garden and it just made her feel so great. Pope: What do you wish people knew about caregiving? Lusby: I wish they knew how much their caregivers really love their clients. I think that a lot of people think caregiving is cold. You know, just go in there, get the job done, and, and get out. You know, oh, all, all mom needs is someone to come and help her shower. Well, it\u2019s more than that because you give them a shower, you give them, like for instance, I will give warm towels out of the dryer instead of just s towel. Warm towels are the dryer, and I help them, you know, to get dressed and lotion their legs or a lot of times they can\u2019t reach their back to wash their back. And it\u2019s all those little things that we do. So, it isn\u2019t just here\u2019s your pills, goodbye. Or, you know, throw a meal in front of you. We sit and visit with \u2019em when they eat their meal. There\u2019s a lot that caregivers do, I think that some people don\u2019t really recognize unless they\u2019re there to see it. It\u2019s not just a job. No, it\u2019s not just a job at all. You really care about these people when, when you\u2019re with a client, your caregivers actually become part of the family. It\u2019s like, oh yeah, I was here. And then, you know, every now and then while we\u2019re at work, we\u2019re caring for their parents or whatever. They\u2019ll call and say, oh, how\u2019s mom doing today? And then you\u2019re able to say, oh, your mom\u2019s doing really well and you know, this is the challenges we had this day. Or, you know, a lot of times how did the appointment go? So we say, oh yeah, your mom got to her appointment on time and everything was fine. And you know, or everything wasn\u2019t fine. But hopefully everything was fine. Pope: And you are a semi-finalist for the National Caregiver of the Year award? Lusby: I am. How exciting. It\u2019s exciting. Pope: What does that mean to you? Lusby: It means a lot. It means it, it shows me that people appreciate what I do, and I feel like, I\u2019m being rewarded for something that I love to do. Shouldn\u2019t everybody feel that way though? We all wanna be rewarded for something that we absolutely love to do. Ramella: That was Phineas Pope talking with Marty Lusby, a caregiver in the Tri-Cities who\u2019s a semifinalist for the Visiting Angel\u2019s 2025 Caregiver of the Year award. This has been a special on caregiving inspired by the PBS documentary from executive producer Bradley Cooper called Caregiving. The conversation continues with a screening of the documentary at the Lewiston Library on May 29th at five 30, followed by a panel discussion on caregiving resources and needs. That\u2019s Thursday, May 29th at the Lewiston Library RSVP at nwpb.org. Special thanks to Rachel\u2019s Sun and Phineas Pope for contributing to this special and a big thanks to the members of NWPB for making this program possible.
