People steeped in the campus turmoil since Oct. 7 understand that there are at least two categories of Jewish students: The majority, who hold some attachment to Israel and were disturbed by the protests against it, and the minority who have participated in those protests. But where would you place Bella, a pseudonymous Jewish student, at a California university with a reputation for antisemitism? She\u2019s proud to be Jewish but never had much connection to Israel. That made her feel guilty after Oct. 7. But learning more about the conflict left her hopeless. \u201cBefore, when I knew nothing, ignorance was kind of nice,\u201d she said. Her roommate started sharing offensive posts about Jews and Israel on social media after the war began, so Bella quietly arranged for new housing the following semester. Yet she couldn\u2019t say whether anti-Zionism, and the protests more generally, were antisemitic. **Antisemitism Decoded** Arno Rosenfeld helps you understand current debates over Jewish safety. Or Shira, a student in Wisconsin who grew up in an observant Conservative and Zionist home but grew disillusioned with Israel during agap year programin the country where she met with Palestinians. \u201cI\u2019m not a Zionist because it doesn\u2019t capture enough,\u201d she said, despite still believing \u201cin Jewish autonomy, in some way.\u201d Shira tried to go to an IfNotNow protest against the war, but was turned off by the signs and slogans and found herself sitting on the sidelines. She still attends Shabbat dinner at the Chabad on campus but walks away from the rabbi when he mentions support for Israel. *** Shira and Bella are two of the 36 Jewish students profiled anonymously in a new paper from Brandeis University that sought to break through the most common binaries \u2014 pro-Israel and anti-Israel. \u201cThere\u2019s a vast number of people on college campuses that wouldn\u2019t be comfortable with either of those labels,\u201d said Jonathan Krasner, who produced the study. \u201cWe wanted to understand where those people were coming from.\u201d Krasner and his research team found six distinct categories of Jewish students they describe this way: The Affirmed:Students whose pro-Israel activism and connection to Jewish identity deepened after Oct. 7 The Aggrieved:Activist students who felt betrayed by Jewish institutions The Retrenched:Students who retreated into private Jewish spaces for safety and support The Conflicted:Students grappling with the moral and political complexities of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict The Disillusioned:Students let down by Jewish and Israeli institutions, fostering skepticism and distrust but not action The Disengaged:Students who distanced themselves from both Jewish and campus political discourse, often due to a desire to avoid conflict Mapped onto a very rough political spectrum, these categories might look something like this. We probably hear the most from \u201caffirmed\u201d students, with many \u2014Shabbos Kestenbaum,Eyal YakobyandEden Yadegar\u2014 becoming national spokespeople for embattled Jews on campus, especially those who fall into the \u201cretrenched\u201d category. The \u201caggrieved,\u201d often represented by members of Jewish Voice for Peace, have also received a platform. But there\u2019s a great missing middle in the discourse created by the absence, in the Brandeis study\u2019s terms, of the \u201cdisillusioned,\u201d \u201cconflicted\u201d and \u201cdisengaged.\u201d *** The category of Jewish students most concerned about antisemitism was, notably, not the \u201caffirmed\u201d \u2014 vocal pro-Israel students who are often the most direct targets for harassment by campus protesters \u2014 but rather the \u201cretrenched,\u201d who observed anti-Zionism with alarm but desperately sought to avoid conflict and turned toward Jewish spaces on campus. Keren, who grew up in an affluent Jewish neighborhood on the East Coast, stopped wearing her Star of David necklace, hid other Jewish jewelry even from her roommate and avoided talking about the war in Gaza with other students. \u201cI don\u2019t want to risk my relationships,\u201d she explained. But, at the same time, she said: \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure that most people I interact with hold antisemitic views.\u201d *** That missing middle of Jewish students that we tend to hear the least about \u2014 the \u201cconflicted,\u201d \u201cdisengaged\u201d and \u201cdisillusioned\u201d \u2014 could represent half of all Jews on campus, and they need support too. You can see their voices reflected in documents like the Harvard task force report I wrote about in thelast editionof this newsletter, and my bet is that they see little benefit from the most aggressive approaches to tamping down campus activism that may appeal to the \u201cretrenched\u201d and \u201caffirmed.\u201d Instead, it may be the softer recommendations for improving the campus climate \u2014 like recruiting students interested in \u201copen inquiry and mutual respect,\u201d as the Harvard report suggested \u2014 that may help reduce polarization, and make the students who have stayed away from Jewish institutions at their schools and avoided conversations about Israel feel more comfortable participating. \ud83d\udcda GO DEEPER Between Home and Homeland: Jewish College Students Confront the Israel-Gaza Conflict and Campus Divides(Journal of Jewish Education) A Venn diagram to help us talk about Israel and antisemitism(Forward) Arno Rosenfeld is an investigative reporter at theForwardcovering antisemitism, philanthropy and sexual misconduct.
