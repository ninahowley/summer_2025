TheNational Gallery of Artand the Smithsonian\u2019sNatural History Museumhave been next-door neighbors in Washington, DC for nearly 90 years\u2014but until now, they\u2019ve never shared so much as a cup of coffee across the fence. That all changes this summer, as the two institutions collaborate to create a cross-pollinated art and natural science exhibition featuring selections from the art gallery\u2019s centuries-old paintings of birds, bugs, and exotic critters \u2026 along with actual examples of those creatures drawn from the Smithsonian\u2019s enormous collection of animal artifacts. The exhibit, called \u201cLittle Beasts: Art, Wonder, and the Natural World,\u201d focuses on a period beginning in the 1500s when artists in Northern Europe\u2014inspired largely by strange specimens that had found their way to Antwerp, Belgium, aboard merchant sailing ships\u2014were creating exquisitely detailed, and unprecedentedly accurate, images of creatures from the smallest insects to the largest mammals. One display case features the Smithsonian\u2019s own specimen of a Central American elephant beetle, the size of a baby\u2019s fist but armored and horned in a most terrifying (if harmless) manner. Next to it is mounted Flemish painter Jacob Hoefnagel\u2019s 1592 painting of the same species, meticulously rendered with brushes that at times consisted of a single hair bristle. Nearby is 17th-century Czech artist Wencenslaus Hollar\u2019s etching of a Tasmanianvasum ceramicumshell, impossibly spindly and surreally suspended in midair, joined by a spectacular real-life specimen from the Smithsonian\u2019s vast shell collection. And there is Hoefnagel\u2019s life-sized painting of a Southern Hawker dragonfly, highlighted with gold paint, seemingly ready to fly off its parchment page\u2014accompanied by a real dragonfly, temporarily freed from its drawer in the Smithsonian\u2019s climate-controlled archives. (Recent studies have revealed that Hoefnagel, obsessed with accuracy, sometimes fastened actual dragonfly wings to his paintings.) **Get smart, have fun** These and the rest of the exhibition\u2019s works embrace a historic moment when artists\u2014many wielding magnifying glasses\u2014became obsessed with capturing nature in all its detail. Throughout three exhibition halls, the juxtaposition of art and artifacts reveals the astonishing amount of research and detail represented in each work. (A rare look inside the Smithsonian's secret storerooms) **'Nature in its most minute detail'** While it holds a prestigious spot on the National Mall, the National Gallery is not part of theSmithsonian\u2014and the collaboration is novel for both institutions. \u201cWe came up with the idea for this during the pandemic,\u201d says Alexandra Libby, a curator of Northern Paintings for the museum.\u201cWe started trading e-mails, hoping to get the Smithsonian people excited about it, explaining that these are not just pretty pictures of butterflies, but evidence that there was a real scientific level of engagement during this period. \u201cThey were engaged from the start. They said, \u2018This is amazing!\u2019\u201d Moving from gallery to gallery, a visitor to this joint venture exhibition walks through a period when artists took the lead in creating the concept of natural history, says Brooks Rich, a curator of Old Master art at the National Gallery. \u201cThe flourishing of interest in nature in its most minute detail that we see here really provided the foundation for the entire discipline,\u201d he says. **You May Also Like** **Does this \u2018secret room\u2019 contain Michelangelo\u2019s lost artwork?

EntitledAier, Aqua, IgnisandTerra(Air, Water, Fire, and Earth), the books contain, on fine parchment paper, 270 hand-painted images of creatures ranging fromhouse fliestoelephantswith a level of detail that rivals anything a 4K TV screen will reproduce today. \u201cPrior to Hoefnagel, most people dismissed insects as vermin,\u201d says Stacy Sell, the museum\u2019s curator of Northern Book Painting. \u201cBut he undertook a sustained study of them, looking at every minute detail, and saw how beautiful they were. \u201cFinally, he said, \u2018You know, watercolor just isn\u2019t going to cut it.\u2019 So, he developed all kinds of innovative techniques to create a level of detail no one had attempted before. \u201cI mean, he actually painted with butterfly dust. That\u2019s pretty amazing.\u201d (How to plan a walking tour of the best museums in D.C.) So delicate are the images in the four books, the museum almost never has them on display. In the course of the exhibition\u2014May through November 2\u2014the pages will be turned just three times. Perhaps the most glorious art work in the exhibition is the epic \u201cNoah\u2019s Family Assembling the Animals Before the Ark,\u201d painted around 1660 by the Flemish artist Jan van Kessell the Elder. The Noahs\u2014dressed in theirFlemish finest\u2014herd a zoofull of animals across a distinctively Northern European landscape toward a distant, barely-visible boat. Camels, turtles, monkeys, ostriches\u2014evenNorth American turkeys\u2014ramble across the frame. But it\u2019s the sky that commands our attention: A riot of birds, two-by-two, winging their way to safety. \u201cIt was such a joy to work with the Natural History Museum managers as they identified all the birds in this painting,\u201d says Libby. \u201cThey studied it to see what the artist got right, and why they might have gotten some things wrong.\u201d For example, at the painting\u2019s extreme upper right, a pair ofParadisaea apoda\u2014Greater Birds of Paradise, from New Guinea\u2014streak into the image like plumed missiles. Besides their glorious color, their most distinctive feature is the fact that they have no legs. \u201cThese birds were prized for their feathers, for women\u2019s hats,\u201d says Libby. \u201cBy the time those dead birds arrived in Europe, their legs were gone.\u201d For a painter obsessed with getting everything just right, only one solution could satisfy both art and science: Rather than get the legs wrong, van Kessell simply left them out.
