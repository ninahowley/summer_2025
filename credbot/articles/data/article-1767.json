Gallagher\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rapid transition from Congress to Palantir highlights the revolving door between government and surveillance tech giants. The rise of Palantir: From CIA pet project to public surveillance giantFounded in 2003 by Peter Thiel and Alex Karp,Palantir Technologieswas birthed in the shadows of post-9/11 militarization, with its earliest funding coming from In-Q-Tel\u00e2\u0080\u0094the CIA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s venture capital arm. For years, its sole client was the U.S. intelligence community, where its software allegedly played a role in tracking down Osama bin Laden. But Palantir\u00e2\u0080\u0099s expansion into civilian life has been anything but benign. By 2020, when the company went public, it had already entrenched itself in public health surveillance through Operation Warp Speed, using its Tiberius platform to manage vaccine distribution and clinical trials.TheCDC also relied on Palantir\u00e2\u0080\u0099s systemsto monitor COVID-19 spread, effectively turning public health into a data-harvesting operation. \"This isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t about safety \u00e2\u0080\u0094 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about control,\" said one privacy advocate who spoke on condition of anonymity. \"When a company with ties to the CIA starts dictating who is a 'terrorist' for protesting, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve crossed into dystopia.\"Gallagher\u00e2\u0080\u0099s crusade: Silencing dissent, from TikTok to PalestineGallagher\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hostility toward free speech isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t new.
