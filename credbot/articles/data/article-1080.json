He was a true leader \u2013 always the first to answer the call, to lend a helping hand or a listening ear, and to lift the spirits of those around him. Cam led not just with authority, but with heart, exemplifying what it means to be part of a family that runs toward danger when others run away. Though Cam was taken from us suddenly in 2015, his presence is felt in every corner of this department, in every act of courage and kindness, and in the strong brotherhood he cultivated. Today, as we dedicate Engine 5, we honor Cam\u2019s legacy. This engine will carry his name and spirit on every call, reminding us and our community of the dedication, bravery, and love he gave so freely. May Engine 5 serve as a symbol of Cam\u2019s unwavering devotion to his family, his fellow firefighters, and to the Sardis Lake community. May we carry forward his example every time answer the call.\u201d **You Might Like** **Best ideas for removing old tree stumps** **Best ideas for removing old tree stumps** **New Heights student in flight academy \u2013 B\u2019ville aviation program paying dividends** **New Heights student in flight academy \u2013 B\u2019ville aviation program paying dividends** **Mayor Ferrell wins second term in close race** **Mayor Ferrell wins second term in close race** **Restaurant Inspections** **Restaurant Inspections** Friends2Follow **Friends2Follow** **Friends2Follow** Home News Sports Opinion Obituaries Classifieds Small Business Contests E-Edition Email Newsletter Sign-up Submit a News Tip Submit a Photo Engagement Announcement Wedding Announcement Public Notices About Us"}
