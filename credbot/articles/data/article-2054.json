At today\u2019sWalmartmeeting, FEP will request that the board explain why it refused to revise its Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives until anti-DEI activist Robby Starbuck threatened to publicly expose the company\u2019s policies and practices. (Proposal 9) \u201cIt was apparently not untilRobby Starbuckthreatened to expose offensive Walmart \u2018wokeness\u2019 that meaningful changes were made, and then within a matter of days,\u201d FEP writes in its supporting statement. \u201cIn addition to concerns about the time it took Walmart to revise its DEI programs, a major concern for Walmart shareholders is that value-destroying DEI initiatives are merely being repackaged rather than eliminated. Corporate governance missteps revealed by the requested report would help prevent that recurrence.\u201d At today\u2019sPayPalmeeting, FEP will request that PayPal analyze the risks of its charitable contributions, as they may reflect discrimination against individuals based on their speech or religious exercise. (Proposal 5) In itssupporting statementfor Proposal 5, FEP draws particular attention to PayPal\u2019s partnerships with the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) and Human Rights Campaign (HRC): Groups like the Southern Poverty Law Center have been criticized across the political spectrum as \u201ca partisan progressive hit operation\u201d more interested in \u201cbludgeon[ing] mainstream politically conservative opponents\u201d than upholding civil rights. It uses its \u201cHate Map\u201d to target many mainstream political and religious groups and individuals, including Moms for Liberty, and Dr. Ben Carson. It has also used its influence to get social media and tech companies, including PayPal, to adopt acceptable use policies that censor SPLC targets. Similarly, the Human Rights Campaign has led coalitions calling on major social media platforms to censor \u201chate speech and harassment\u201d that includes many mainstream views on parental rights and human sexuality. At today\u2019sNetflixmeeting, FEP will ask the board to assess how the company\u2019s affirmative action initiatives impact Netflix\u2019s risks related to actual and perceived discrimination on the basis of protected categories under civil rights law. (Proposal 7) Stefan Padfield As he presents Proposal 7 today, Free Enterprise Project Executive DirectorStefan Padfieldwill tell Netflix shareholders: Netflix apparently continues to practice affirmative action in a variety of ways despite the fact that the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in the 2023 case ofSFFA v. Harvardthat discriminating on the basis of race in college admissions violates the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment and as a result, the legality of corporate affirmative action programs has been called into question, with thirteen Attorneys General warning that SFFA implicates corporate affirmative action programs\u2026 Unfortunately,the most likely outcome hereis that our proposal will be defeated by a combination of apparently biased and conflicted proxy advisers, asset managers and corporate executives \u2014 leaving what have been referred to as the \u201ctrue\u201d and \u201cultimate\u201d owners of the company stuck with race and sex discrimination being conducted with their money in the name of \u201cdiversity\u201d and \u201cinclusion.\u201d At tomorrow\u2019s meeting ofGoogleparent companyAlphabet, FEP will request that the board consider ending Alphabet\u2019s participation in the Human Rights Campaign\u2019s Corporate Equality Index (CEI). (Proposal 6) In his presentation of Proposal 6 tomorrow, Padfield plans to say: Many believe that HRC\u2019s CEI functions like a social credit score for corporations, with the threat of a bad score being wielded by HRC against corporations to force them to do the political bidding of radical activists, including sowing gender confusion in youth, encouraging permanent surgical procedures on confused and vulnerable teens, and effectively eliminating girls\u2019 and women\u2019s sports and private spaces. This is likely why so many major corporations have recently severed ties with HRC\u2026 Alphabet argues that its engagement with organizations does not necessarily reflect an endorsement of their agendas. However, in addition to cooperating with HRCs survey, Alphabet is also a Platinum Partner of HRC, which HRC proudly touts as evidence that Alphabet provides \u201cgenerous support of the work of the Human Rights Campaign.\u201d \u2026In opposing our proposal, Alphabet is defiantly refusing to even consider ending its participation in the CEI, which is all our proposal asks. In light of this, Alphabet should at least answer the following questions. First, what is a woman? Second, can a man become a woman simply by saying so? Third, can a child be born in the wrong body? Alphabet arguably breaches its duties to shareholders by supporting HRC as it does without having answered these questions. FEP expects that all four of these proposals will be defeated by a wide margin, but argues that thefinal vote tallies will not reflect the will of the majority of individual shareholders. Also, in addition to asking shareholders to support these four proposals, FEP has publishedcomplete voting scorecardsfor each of these companies as part of its Proxy Navigator voting guide.
