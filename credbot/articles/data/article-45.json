Each article or show is rated by at least three analysts \u2013 one left-leaning, one right-leaning and one center, politically. All of our media analysts complete a training period that includes a thorough introduction to our methodology, as well as practice rating articles and other news content. We purposefully assign each analyst a breadth of coverage over as many sources as possible to enhance each analyst\u2019s familiarity with sources across the spectrum. Analysts generally score articles similarly following our analysis training, regardless of their political lean; however, when significant differences occur, the group engages in a conversation during which analysts present their rationale for their respective scores. We do not rate the merits of political positions. Rather, we place the content where it descriptively belongs relative to the current range of political thought within the United States. When scoring for reliability, our method focuses on classifying content along a continuum including fact, analysis, opinion, incomplete story, propaganda, and fabricated information. All of the above minimizes the impact of analyst bias on reliability and source bias scoring. It results in a rating of sources that many individuals, instructors, and other stakeholders find helpful in navigating today\u2019s news ecosystem. **Working as an analyst** Most of our analysts work part time, and all work fully remote.This is a paid position at $20/hour, and analysts are required to work a minimum ofsixhours per week.
