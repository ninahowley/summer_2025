After premiering at the Venice Film Festival in September 2023, the film was released on Amazon Prime on June 4 and opened torave reviews.

It starsAbhishek Banerjee, Shubham Vardhan, and Mia Maelzer in key roles. The Quintcaught up with the executive producers, actor Abhishek, and producer Gaurav Dhingra to talk about the reasons behind diminishing theatrical footfalls, why directors are stepping away from the Hindi film industry to make films, the challenges of securing funding, and more. In the recent past, the Hindi film industry has seen directors leave to direct films in other industry, we asked the filmmakers what they thought is the larger issue at play. He also added that, there was a time producers made films and they were proud of it. It was not about statistics and algorithm, \"the moment film studios and companies started going public, things started going downhill.\" Director, producer and writer, Vikramaditya says, \"most of our entertainment is owned by tech companies and not by old-fashioned studios. There is a broadening of that gap, that is happening between people with money and the creative people. Sometimes there is a a tendency for there to be a slight coldness in the approach towards making a movie. In an industry like this, we need warmth and a sense of collectivism.\" The theatrical footfalls have been unpredictable, and films have not been performing as expected at the box office. We asked the filmmakers what factors contribute to this. Vikramaditya says, \"Viewing habits have changed since the pandemic. The audience is used to the idea of watching movies at home. However, if the trailer excites the audience, they will go to the theatres to watch the film.\" Laapataa Ladiesdirector Kiran Rao believes that, thanks to streaming, there are so many great options to watch sitting in your home. \"It takes a lot for someone to go out and find the right show, in the right neighbourhood, and the price of tickets is also sometimes prohibitive.\" She also says that the audience wants to watch films in theatres, but sometimes they aren't playing for long enough, or by the time you hear of the film, it's gone from the theatres. \u201cOnly big films can afford it, and small films \u2014 even great ones \u2014 often can\u2019t afford to reach their viewers.\u201d \u201cFor changes of this scale, we need an institutional approach. Every industry is managed and schooled by rules,\u201d director Karan Tejpal added. The filmmakers believe it's time for institutional support, with the state needing to step in. \u201cFilms from the southern states have institutional backing. The Hindi film industry, on the other hand, is a bit all over the place,\u201d says Kiran Rao. Watch the video for more. (At The Quint, we question everything.
