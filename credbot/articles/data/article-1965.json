I discovered Emma Thomas, founder of the campaign group,Children of Transitioners, after aletterfrom the University of Sussex Hospitals NHS Trust responding to Emma\u2019s group, who hadquestionedthe trust on their \u201cperinatal care policy for trans and non binary people policy,\u201d was leaked. Children of Transitioners had inquired about \u201csafeguarding concerns about the sexual and emotional abuse of babies and children of transitioners\u201d and asked about evidence supporting the claim that \u201cmale secretions\u201d (that is to say, the \u201clactation\u201d trans identified males claim they can produce to \u201cbreastfeed\u201d babies) are \u201csafe and beneficial for infants.\u201d In the letter, the NHS uses terms like \u201chuman milk\u201d as it is \u201cneutral and not gender biased,\u201d andclaimsthe \u201cmilk\u201d produced by trans-identified men after taking a combination of drugs is \u201ccomparable to that produced following the birth of a baby.\u201d As I looked further into Emma\u2019s story, I found she has very important insight into the adult transexual male, and the impact these men can have as fathers of children. In this episode, I speak with her about her childhood, her father, and her concerns about protecting kids and babies from trans ideology. Enjoy fiercely independent, women-led media?
