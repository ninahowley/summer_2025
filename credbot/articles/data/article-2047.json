Harvard, located three miles away, is giving the district a run for its money when it comes to gas lighting. Look no further than Harvard\u2019s honorary degree recipient,Elaine Kimfrom the University of California, Berkeley, to see the Ivy League attempt to disavow anti-Semitism while embracing someone who embodies it on campus. Amid Harvard University\u2019s fight to protect its foreign students from the Trump administration\u2019svisarestrictions, to combat ongoing anti-Semitisminvestigations, and moves to defund the school through the government\u2019s cancellation of grants and major donors\u2019 withholding of donations, the university showed its true colors. In granting Elaine Kim an honorary degree, Harvard exemplifies the irony and moral decrepitude that have come to characterize higher education. After Secretary of State Marco Rubioannouncedthat the Department of Homeland Security would begin revoking student visas from China due to national security concerns, Harvard did the predictable thing and sued the government on the grounds that it violated the First Amendment, the Due Process Clause, and the Administrative Procedure Act. Certainly, not all Chinese students are spies for the Chinese Communist Party; however, even students who may love the West and hate Beijing are subject topressureand threats from their homeland. American intelligence agencies havelong warnedabout the threat of student spies. The recentcaseof Chinese spies at Stanford University confirms that the threat is real. Harvard has over 1,000 Chinesestudentswho might face their visas getting revoked.

In 2013, well before the drama of the Trump years, Harvard wassuedby the nonprofit group, Students for Fair Admissions (Students for Fair Admissions Inc. v.President and Fellows of Harvard College)for violating the Fourteenth Amendment and discriminating against Asian students in admissions. After a decade-long legal battle that made its way to the Supreme Court, justices ruled in a 6-2 ruling that indeed Harvard illegally and unconstitutionally discriminated against students based on race. When examining student records, Students for Fair Admissions claimed itdiscoveredthat Harvard ranked Asian-American students as \u201clower in personality and likability ratings\u201d compared to other students. According to theopinionof the Supreme Court, the university\u2019s main response to criticism that it was racist in its admissions was simply \u201ctrust us.\u201d The courtstatedthat Harvard\u2019s \u201crace-based admissions systems \u2026 fail to comply with the twin commands of the Equal Protection Clause that race may never be used as a \u2018negative\u2019 and that it may not operate as a stereotype.\u201d Harvard\u2019s commencement was already built upon irony, but it turned its graduation ceremony into a full opera of hypocrisy when it awarded Elaine Kim, aprofessorof Asian American cultural studies and feminism, an honorary degree. Kim was a controversial choice given her opensupportfor the United States Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel (USACBI) and the overall Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement. Despite being an emeritus professor, Kim is active in her animosity towards Israel, having openlyendorsedboycotting the Batsheva Dance Company\u2019s U.S. tour just this year. Kim\u2019s support for BDS and the anti-Semitism it represents is not unusual. [RELATED: Harvard\u2019s \u2018Abysmal\u2019 Year Continues] The National Association of Scholarsdemonstratedhow ethnic studies and various identity groups coalesce around BDS and justify their actions through frameworks of critical theory. What is unusual is why Harvard chose to bestow an honorary degree on an anti-Semitic emeritus professor. Harvarddefendedits choice by declaring that \u201crecipients are chosen based on a candidate\u2019s overall lifetime contributions and accomplishments.\u201d On the question of anti-Semitism, Harvard turned up the gaslight to a full glow when itassertedthat the university \u201cstrongly opposes academic boycotts.\u201d In other words, Harvard wants you to know it does not condone anti-Semitism, but overlooks the anti-Semites it needlessly awards. Added up, Harvard\u2019s commencement on the surface is the stuff of dark comedy about a school tossing Molotov cocktails on its own reputation while it is already burning. Last year, polls revealed that the public\u2019sperceptionof Harvard was already at a record low. Megadonor hedge fund billionaire Bill Ackmanassertedrecently that it would be worth revoking Harvard\u2019s tax-exempt status. Even Harvard\u2019s enrollment isdown, and not due to falling birth rates. Defending student visas from Communist China after discriminating against Asian-Americans and awarding anti-Semites whiledeclaringit is working against anti-Semitism would be hilarious if it were not so twisted. Harvard\u2019s dark, gaslit comedy highlights everything that is wrong with higher education. The identity politics, virtue signaling, and racism when it is conducive to higher-ed\u2019s own ideological interests are what make today\u2019s American universities run. If universities did not have double standards, they would have none at all.
