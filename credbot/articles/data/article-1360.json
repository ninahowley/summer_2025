Help change the world by becoming a Bureau Insider PublishedNovember 22 2024 ByEd Siddons,Josephine Lethbridge,Jasper Jackson,Chrissie Giles,Billie Gay Jackson TBIJ co-publishes its stories with major media outlets around the world so they reach as many people as possible. A sexual abuser; a wealthy businessman; a landlord \u201coffering substandard and potentially dangerous accommodation to vulnerable people\u201d; a \u201cwealth creator\u201d. All of them silenced scrutiny by using the threat of a lawsuit against their critics, a cross-party group of MPs argued in Parliament on Thursday. The debate wasprompted by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism\u2019s (TBIJ) Silenced Stories project. TBIJ spent a year uncovering stories in the public interest that were suppressed because the UK\u2019s legal system favours the rich and powerful, making it dangerous for people and publications with legitimate questions and scrutiny to speak up. TBIJ is not alleging that any individual or organisation breached any regulatory obligations or that any legal threats were abusive or meritless. Sometimes there was little in the way of a threat. Instead, TBIJ\u2019s work highlighted the chilling effect the legal system has on scrutinising those in power. After a two-and-a-half hour debate in which more than a dozen MPs from seven parties raised concerns, Heidi Alexander, the justice minister, said the government would not bring any new legislation during this parliament. This was, she said, to avoid ending up with \u201cunworkable legislation with unintended consequences\u201d. However, she did acknowledge that abusive lawsuits \u201chave a chilling effect on public interest journalism and pose a threat to our democracy\u201d. TBIJ has not investigated the claims that led to the threats shared by MPs itself and doesn\u2019t know whether the allegations made by the MPs are true. However, we believe there is a public interest in providing a fair and balanced reflection of the debate. TBIJ has only added further details, where it has more information, to provide balance. **Lloyd Hatton on scrutiny of a $500m development in Uzbekistan** Hatton talked about Professor Kristian Lasslett from Ulster University, who wrote an article foropenDemocracyraising concerns about a lucrative construction project in Uzbekistan. His research questioned why this project was costing hundreds of millions of dollars and raised concerns about due diligence procedures. His article focused on the links between the developers and a family sanctioned for corruption, the Guptas, who have been accused of systemic corruption in South Africa. Lasslett received a legal letter from a boutique law firm on behalf of the developers. It provided some meaningful information but also outright denied any relationship between the developers and the Guptas, despite clear evidence to the contrary.openDemocracydecided that the time and financial expense it would take to face down a deep-pocketed litigant would outweigh the benefits of publishing the story. \u201cThe public interest merits of this investigation are, in my view, undeniable,\u201d said Hatton, \u201cbut this story was never published. The information it contains, linking potential procurement corruption to the looting of billions of dollars from South Africa\u2019s state coffers was effectively blocked. The Uzbek people were denied and deprived this information that speaks directly to its government\u2019s propriety in the award of enormous public contracts.\u201d What are the next steps to end abusive libel actions? **Hatton on \u201cthreats\u201d from lawyers working for the former chancellor Nadhim Zahawi** Hatton also said Dan Neidle, a tax lawyer and researcher, investigated whether Zahawi \u201cwas benefiting from tax codes that he had had a hand in shaping\u201d and whether he had avoided almost \u00a34m in capital gains tax. Neidle shared the allegations on Twitter, before receiving two letters from Zahawi\u2019s lawyers demanding he retract the accusation. Instead of complying, Neidle published the letters. Hatton said: \u201cIt\u2019s not just the odd former politician who uses legal threats to avoid scrutiny. Sadly Britain has become a go-to destination for lawfare tactics. Our courts have become the playground of the super wealthy. The UK is by far the most frequent country of origin for SLAPPs [strategic lawsuits against public participation].\u201d **Julian Lewis on legal letters from the Post Office** Lewis cited the example ofComputer Weekly\u2019s coverage of the Post Office Horizon scandal starting in 2009, during which the trade magazine\u2019s investigation into the flawed prosecution of post masters suffered \u201cmultiple aggressive actions to shut down the story\u201d. Lewis said the editor of the magazine, Bill Goodwin, is quoted as saying they received multiple \u201cbullying letters\u201d demanding to know sources. He added that the Post Office\u2019s general counsel also wrote to the magazine in 2015, claiming an article reporting the closure of a working group looking into claims against the Horizon software included \u201c \u2018significant number of inaccuracies\u2019 and \u2018damaging errors\u2019 and argued that the reporters had acted improperly.\u201d The Post Office has since apologised for the scandal and, Lewis said, committed to being transparent and supporting justice and redress for those who have been impacted by the scandal. **Apsana Begum on her own experiences of surviving domestic abuse** Begum described her own experience of lawfare as a survivor of domestic abuse, and the need to tackle the ability of abusers to \u201cweaponise litigation\u201d. She said \u201cvexatious litigation\u201d was used \u201cwith the purpose of shutting down my public participation as a democratically elected member of Parliament and as a survivor of domestic abuse\u201d. She said she had been pursued in the courts by a local council, where her ex-husband was a councillor at the time, and that the authority has ended up spending more money on the case than the amount it alleged it was trying to recoup. The purpose of these types of proceedings, she said, \u201cis to silence, intimate, discredit and further disempower\u201d victims. **Begum on scrutiny of a children\u2019s care home** Begum also described how Tom Latchem, a freelance journalist, faced legal threats after publishing a story withByline Times. The story was about Ofsted suspending a care home owned by Ampika Pickston, the fianc\u00e9e of West Ham\u2019s billionaire owner David Sullivan, \u201cdue to reported serious safeguarding failings\u201d. Begum said that Latchem believes he has been prevented from reporting further on the care home, in particular an incident in which Ms Pickston allegedly took a child from the home to her private residence. He was sent a letter from Pickston\u2019s lawyers warning that, if they considered anything defamatory or libellous in a published article, they would advise their client to sue both the newspaper and any individual author or journalist for libel, seeking damages and costs. The lawyers said the communications were courteous and cordial and did not prevent him from any reporting. However, Latchem feels he cannot afford to face down someone with such resources. \u201cIt is obvious who loses out if accountability and transparency on the treatment of children in care homes are thwarted,\u201d Begum said. **Si\u00e2n Berry about a citizen questioning a housing provider** Berry outlined the case of Ben Jenkins, a housing campaigner who faced multiple legal threats from the company he co-owns his home with, GreenSquareAccord, for repeatedly raising concerns over the safety and adequacy of his home. GreenSquareAccord said Jenkins\u2019 criticism was excessive, targeted individual employees, and was so frequent it prevented them from responding to other residents\u2019 issues. The battle with GSA had a \u201cserious ongoing effect\u201d on Jenkins\u2019s mental health, Berry said. \u201cSafety in housing completely depends upon maintaining good standards and public accountability,\u201d she said. \u201cUltimately, that depends on this kind of whistleblowing.\u201d She called on Alexander, the justice minister, to look at \u201cabuses of legal proceedings\u201d and the use of bullying lawfare, \u201cwhere money and resources are used to shield the powerful from proper public scrutiny when they should be held to account\u201d. SLAPPs thwarted attempts to stop Al-Fayed, says MP **Joe Powell on legal threats over sexual abuse allegations against Mohamed Al-Fayed** Powell highlighted Mohamed Al-Fayed\u2019s legal threats to journalists who attempted to expose his alleged sexual misconduct. A BBC investigation this year aired multiple allegations of rape and sexual assault against the late Harrods owner. In 2008, the Mail on Sunday prepared a report stating that Al-Fayed was under investigation for sexually assaulting a 15-year-old, Powell said, adding that legal threats forced it to remove his name and refer instead to a \u201csenior Harrods executive\u201d. \u201c[SLAPPs] don\u2019t just protect reputations, they shield individuals from accountability and allow abuse to continue unchecked,\u201d Powell said. \u201cAl Fayed died before he could face justice. Imagine how many women\u2019s lives would not have been ruined if anti-SLAPP legislation had been in place, and journalists had been able to report freely on the case.\u201d **Rachel Gilmour on a \u201cwealth creator\u2019s\u201d response to a woman whose brother had died by suicide** Gilmour raised the story of Carrie Jones, who lost her brother, Danny Butcher, an army reservist, to suicide in 2019. Butcher had spent thousands to attend a controversial \u201cwealth creation\u201d course run by Samuel Leeds. When Jones sought answers from Leeds after his death, including in a public video on Youtube, she ultimately received a legal letter from Ellisons, Leeds\u2019 solicitors. \u201cIt did not immediately threaten her with a lawsuit, but it warned that legal action could follow if she suggested that Mr Leeds and his course had had any influence on her brother\u2019s suicide,\u201d Gilmour said. Gilmour saidTheGuardianfound 15 individuals who were subjected to legal threats from Leeds. She also highlighted one man, who wished to remain anonymous, who faced a legal threat from Leeds\u2019 solicitors after posting on his MP\u2019s social media page asking about protections for vulnerable people from wealth creation schemes. The individual did not even mention Leeds by name, Gilmour said. Leeds said this account was \u201cone-sided, and misses important context, which we have no confidence you will fairly represent to fellow MPs\u201d, adding that he has been the subject of a \u201ccampaign of abuse\u201d. Gilmour concluded with a resounding plea for parliament to introduce anti-SLAPP protections, something she said was \u201cdesperately needed for this country, for our citizens, and indeed for our legal system\u201d. **Seamus Logan on a woman forced out of work after alleging sexual assault** Logan shared the story of Jan Cruickshank, a constituent of his in Aberdeenshire North and Moray East. Cruickshank was allegedly sexually assaulted by a coworker at the Construction Industry Training Board (CITB) in 2015. After suffering from a nervous breakdown when she reported the allegations, Cruickshank had to confront her alleged attacker daily on returning to work. Logan described how CITB subjected her to a \u201ctargeted campaign to discredit\u201d her after its legal team indicated it was potentially liable should her case come to trial. A predetermined HR investigation \u201cfocused on facilitating her exit from the company\u201d, whistleblowers revealed. Her employment was terminated and she was pressured to accept a low settlement and asked to sign a non-disclosure agreement so she could not speak freely about the case. Logan called for a broader understanding of SLAPPs, emphasising the need for protective measures for individuals seeking justice. **Max Wilkinson on substandard housing for asylum seekers** Wilkinson revealed how an investigation into \u201csubstandard and potentially dangerous\u201d housing for homeless people and asylum seekers was stifled by a threat of legal action from the taxpayer-funded landlord. Journalists fromInside Housingsaw a stain on the ceiling apparently caused by leaking sewage, a broken fire door, and damp that risked the health of the vulnerable people that lived there. \u201cThis clear case of public interest should have involved the naming of the landlords and the building. That would have enabled power to be held to account,\u201d Wilkinson said. But threats of legal action forcedInside Housingto leave the building and landlord\u2019s names out \u2013 meaning they escaped scrutiny and could still be receiving public money. \u201cWe do not know whether that landlord is still in receipt of public sector contracts, or whether they are still running buildings that are not fit for habitation, and there is no way for us to find out.\u201d This story was amended on 2 December 2024 to clarify that MPs from seven parties attended the debate.
