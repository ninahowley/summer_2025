A poll conducted on Sunday revealed a stunning correlation \u2013 the pride react on Facebook may be leading to homosexual and pansexual curiosity among straight males. The survey, conducted bySharp Research Institute, noticed a spike not only in the homosexual desires of straight males aged 18-40, but also actual physical homosexual activity. It appears that the pride react is influencing men to commit homosexual acts on one another. A spike in the data of this magnitude has not been seen since around 2016, when transsexuals were given the right to use normal people restrooms. \u201cThe pride react is turning people gay all over the world,\u201d one researcher told us under the condition of anonymity. \u201cWe think Obama may have added some kind ofMKULTRA technologyto the react that is causing people to turn gay.\u201d The new pride react is available on Facebook through the month of June in an attempt to turn as many straight men gay as possible. Christians are working on a counter assault that willreplace the rainbow flags with a pair of praying hands. **That's Worth Sharing** Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Facebook Click to share on X (Opens in new window)X **Related** **Post navigation** **An unexpected treatment for seasonal allergies shows promising results** **An unexpected treatment for seasonal allergies shows promising results** **Studies show kids do better without lunch** **Studies show kids do better without lunch** **One comment** Jimmy johnsays:June 21, 2018 at 3:59 pmThis was hillariousLikeLikeReply This was hillarious LikeLike This was hillarious LikeLike **What do you think?Cancel reply** \u0394 This site uses Akismet to reduce spam.Learn how your comment data is processed. **Important dates in science history** January 2021(1) January 2020(1) February 2018(2) January 2018(1) October 2017(1) June 2017(1) March 2017(11) January 2017(2) November 2016(1) October 2016(1) September 2016(2) August 2016(1) July 2016(1) June 2016(1) May 2016(1) April 2016(2) March 2016(2) February 2016(4) January 2016(8) **Contributors** Amber Diffenderfer, PhDFacebook Stupidly Disabled Thousands of Valid ProfilesThe Mandalorian = MAGA?
