In addition to monitoring voting on election day, the mission \u201canalyzed various aspects of the elections such as electoral organization, electoral technology, the evaluation and selection process for judicial candidacies, electoral justice, and the participation of women,\u201d the EOM said. **Criticisms of the judicial elections and electoral process** The report stated that the EOM observed that the process related to Mexico\u2019s first-ever judicial elections \u201cwas carried out in a very short timeframe and in a complex political context, characterized by strong polarization and a high level of litigation.\u201d \u201cLast Sunday\u2019s election is the result ofthe constitutional reform approved in September 2024, which establishes popular vote as the selection mechanism for those who will serve as judges and justices at all levels throughout the national territory,\u201d it said. As part of its observation mission, which began May 24, the EOM observers spoke to members of the judiciary, government representatives, academics, judicial election candidates and representatives of civil society organizations, among others. The EOM said in its report that \u201cmost of the actors with whom the Mission interviewed agreed that, despite the efforts of the electoral authority, the electorate had little knowledge about the positions at stake in the election, their different responsibilities and the profiles of the applicants.\u201d \u201cThe interviewees also agreed that the prohibition on buying advertising space on radio, television, or social media made it very difficult for candidates to make themselves known,\u201d the report said. On June 1, voters faced the gargantuan and confusing task of electing a total of almost 2,700 judges, including nearly 900 federal ones, from a pool of some 7,700 candidates. Despite the low turnout, President Claudia Sheinbaum described the democratic exercise as a great success. For its part, the EOM noted that: Some candidates wereaccused of having links to criminal organizations. Electoral packages containing 131,000 ballots were stolen in Chiapas. Delays in the opening of polling stations \u201cwere recorded in various regions of the country.\u201d Complaints were filed \u201cabout the distribution of \u2018cheat sheets\u2019 (acordeones) during election day.\u201d Some of those cheat sheets were distributed by people affiliated with Mexico\u2019s ruling party Morena, which, government critics say, will effectively come to control the country\u2019s judiciary given that large numbers of candidates it tacitly supported were elected to judgeships. The EOM highlighted that \u201cthe nine candidacies with the highest number of votes for the Supreme Courtwere promoted on physical and virtual \u2018cheat sheets.'\u201d \u201cFurthermore, it was verified that six of the new justices were nominated by the Executive Branch\u2019s [candidate selection] committee and the remaining three are current members of the court appointed by the former president, which raises reasonable doubts about the autonomy and independence of the highest tribunal with respect to the Executive,\u201d the mission said. The OEM also pointed out thatthe National Electoral Institute (INE) only received just over half the funding it requestedto organize the elections. It noted that the INE was consequently forced to cut costs in a range of ways, including by reducing \u201cthe number of sectional polling stations by more than 50%.\u201d **Recommendations ahead of 2027 judicial elections** The OEM made a number of recommendations based on its observation of the process related to Mexico\u2019s June 1 judicial elections. A second round of judicial elections is slated to be held in 2027 on the same day that federal midterm elections will take place. Among the EOM\u2019s recommendations were that: \u201cThe responsibility of verifying the eligibility and suitability of applicants\u201d be assigned to \u201ca single body, institutionally separate from the three branches of State, and composed of figures of recognized competence, impartiality and prestige.\u201d \u201cSome type of public financing mechanism\u201d be introduced \u201cthat allows applicants to truly make themselves known to the citizenry.\u201d \u201cA working group between the INE and the involved branches of the federal government\u201d be convened \u201cin order to analyze the impact of the budget reduction, and ensure adequate resources for future electoral processes.\u201d \u201cCivic education and dissemination strategies\u201d be strengthened in order to \u201cbetter explain voting methods, taking into account the age, cultural and educational diversity of the population.\u201d \u201cNecessary legal reforms\u201d be introduced to Congress \u201cto avoid the concurrence of presidential, legislative, gubernatorial and local elections with judicial ones.\u201d **\u2018An extremely complex and polarizing electoral process\u2019** In the \u201cfinal considerations\u201d section of its report, the EOM said that \u201can extremely complex and polarizing electoral process\u201d had taken place in Mexico. \u201cThe analysis of this first experience shows that there are multiple opportunities for improvement. The Mission urges electoral authorities and political bodies to consider the recommendations made to strengthen all stages of the process, correct current deficiencies, and ensure the sustainability of the adopted solutions,\u201d it said. The EOM also said that Mexican citizens and institutions \u201cwill have to evaluate whether the current model of selecting judicial authorities through popular vote, which is unprecedented worldwide, contributes to strengthening the fundamental principles of the administration of justice; or if, on the contrary, it ends up weakening the transparency, impartiality, effectiveness, and independence of the Judiciary.\u201d \u201cThe lessons learned in this process highlight the importance that any reform to the model for selecting judges be done gradually, based on a truly pluralistic debate and, above all, on a comprehensive, technical, and professional diagnosis of the problems sought to be resolved and the most effective mechanisms to do so,\u201d it said. \u201cThat being said, the Mission does not recommend that this model of selecting judges be replicated for other countries in the region,\u201d the EOM said. **The Mexican government responds** President Sheinbaum, who argues that judicial elections are necessary to rid Mexico\u2019s judiciary of corruption,declared on Saturdaythat \u201cit\u2019s not within the functions\u201d of the Washington D.C.-based Organization of American States to \u201cgive recommendations on how a country should choose its judiciary.\u201d She acknowledged on Monday that improvements to the judicial election process can be made. \u201cI believe the INE has to do a review, and all of us have to as well, about what we learnt from this election and how to perfect the voting process,\u201d Sheinbaum said. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (SRE) said in astatementon Saturday that through Mexico\u2019s \u201cpermanent mission\u201d to the OAS, it \u201cexpressed, through a diplomatic note addressed to the secretary general of the organization, its firm rejection of some recommendations contained in the preliminary report of the observers dispatched for the judicial election on June 1.\u201d The SRE said that it argued in the diplomatic note that the EOM \u201cexceeded its mandate\u201d and carried out \u201cactions contrary to the principles ofthe [OAS] charter,\u201d in particular the article that says that \u201cevery State has the right to choose, without external interference, its political, economic, and social system and to organize itself in the way best suited to it.\u201d \u201cAn Electoral Observation Mission doesn\u2019t have the authority to try to impose its own criteria on the way in which countries, in use of their sovereignty, should put together their judiciary,\u201d the ministry said.
