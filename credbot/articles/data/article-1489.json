If any of the 2025 Bonds are subject to mandatory sinking fund redemption, the Trustee shall credit against the mandatory sinking fund requirement for any term bonds and corresponding mandatory sinking fund redemption obligation, in the order determined by the Corporation, any term bonds maturing on the same date which have previously been redeemed (otherwise than as a result of a previous mandatory redemption requirement) or delivered to the Trustee for cancellation or purchased for cancellation by the Trustee and not theretofore applied as a credit against any redemption obligation. Each term bond so delivered or canceled shall be credited by the Trustee at one hundred percent (100%) of the principal amount thereof against the mandatory sinking fund obligation on such mandatory obligations and the principal amount of that term bond to be redeemed by operation of the mandatory sinking fund requirement shall be accordingly reduced; provided, however, the Trustee shall credit such term bonds only to the extent received on or before forty-five (45) days preceding the applicable mandatory redemption date. Notice of any redemption will be mailed by first class mail by the Trustee not less than thirty (30) days prior to the date selected for redemption to the registered owners of all of the 2025 Bonds to be redeemed at the address shown on the registration books of the Trustee; provided, however, that failure to give such notice by mailing or a defect in the notice or the mailing as to such 2025 Bonds will not affect the validity of any proceedings for redemption as to any other of such 2025 Bonds for which notice is adequately given. Notice having been mailed, such 2025 Bonds designated for redemption will, on the date specified in such notice, become due and payable at the then applicable redemption price. On presentation and surrender of such 2025 Bonds in accordance with such notice at the place at which the same are expressed in such notice to be redeemable, such 2025 Bonds will be redeemed by the Trustee and any paying agent for that purpose. From and after the date of redemption so designated, unless default is made in the redemption of such 2025 Bonds upon presentation, interest on such 2025 Bonds designated for redemption will cease.

Each bid must be for all of the 2025 Bonds and must state the rate or rates of interest therefor, not exceeding the maximum per annum interest rate hereinbefore specified. Such interest rate or rates must be in multiples of one-eighth (1/8) or one-one hundredth (1/100) of one percent (1.00%). Bids specifying more than one interest rate for the 2025 Bonds must also specify the amount and maturities of the 2025 Bonds bearing each rate. All 2025 Bonds maturing on the same date shall bear the same rate of interest. Although not a term of sale, it is requested that each bid show the total dollar cost to final maturity and the true interest cost on the entire issue to which such bid relates.

The sale of the 2025 Bonds will be awarded to the bidder for the 2025 Bonds making a bid for the 2025 Bonds that conforms to the specifications herein and which produces the lowest True Interest Cost rate to the Corporation with respect to the 2025 Bonds. The True Interest Cost rate is that rate which, when used to compute the total present value as of the date of delivery of the 2025 Bonds of all debt service payments on the 2025 Bonds on the basis of semiannual compounding, produces an amount equal to the sum of the par value of the 2025 Bonds minus any premium bid plus any discount. In the event of a bidder's error in interest cost rate calculations, the interest rates and premium, if any, set forth or incorporated by reference in the Official Bid Form will be considered as the intended bid. In the event that the Corporation fails to receive a bid on the 2025 Bonds from at least three (3) Underwriters (as hereinafter defined), the Corporation shall so advise the successful bidder for the 2025 Bonds (such successful bidder, the \"Purchaser\"). If the Purchaser is an Underwriter intending to resell all or any portion of the 2025 Bonds to the Public (as hereinafter defined), the Purchaser must, prior to acceptance of its bid by the Corporation, either (i) agree in writing to neither offer nor sell any of the 2025 Bonds to any person at a price that is higher than the initial offering price for each maturity of 2025 Bonds during the Holding Period (as hereinafter defined) for any maturity of the 2025 Bonds or (ii) request in writing that the Corporation treat the first price at which ten percent (10%) of a maturity of the 2025 Bonds (the 10% test) is sold to the Public as the issue price of that maturity, applied on a maturity-by-maturity basis. For purposes of this Notice of Intent to Sell Bonds, (a) the term \"Public\" shall mean any person (including an individual, trust, estate, partnership, association, company, or corporation) other than an Underwriter or a related party to an Underwriter, (b) the term \"related party\" means any two (2) or more persons who have greater than fifty percent (50%) common ownership, directly or indirectly, (c) the term \"Underwriter\" means (i) any person that agrees pursuant to a written contract with the Corporation (or with the lead underwriter to form an underwriting syndicate) to participate in the initial sale of the 2025 Bonds to the Public, and (ii) any person that agrees pursuant to a written contract directly or indirectly with a person described in clause (i) of this paragraph to participate in the initial sale of the 2025 Bonds to the Public (including a member of a selling group or a party to a retail distribution agreement participating in the initial sale of the 2025 Bonds to the Public), (d) the term \"Underwriters\" means more than one Underwriter, and (e) the term \"Holding Period\" means the period starting on the date the Corporation awards the 2025 Bonds to the Purchaser (the \"Sale Date\") and ending on the earlier of (i) the close of the fifth business day after the Sale Date, or (ii) the date on which the Underwriter has sold at least ten percent (10%) of each maturity of the 2025 Bonds to the Public at prices that are no higher than the initial offering price for such maturity of the 2025 Bonds. Any underwriter executing and delivering an Official Bid Form with respect to the 2025 Bonds agrees thereby that if its bid is accepted by the Corporation (i) it shall accept such designation and (ii) it shall enter into a contractual relationship with all participating underwriters of the 2025 Bonds for purposes of assuring the receipt of each such participating underwriter of the Final Official Statement. The Purchaser shall be responsible for providing (i) in writing the initial reoffering prices and other terms, if any, to the Municipal Advisor as and at the time requested and (ii) a certification verifying information as to the bona fide initial offering prices of the 2025 Bonds to the Public and sales of the 2025 Bonds appropriate for determination of the issue price of, and the yield on, the 2025 Bonds under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, as and at the time requested by the Corporation's bond counsel. GOOD FAITH DEPOSIT. The Purchaser will be required to provide to the Corporation a wire transfer in Federal Reserve or other immediately available funds made payable to the Corporation in the amount of one percent (1.00%) of the aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Bonds sold to the Purchaser (the \"Deposit\") within twenty-four (24) hours after being notified of being the Purchaser. If the Deposit is not received by the time set forth above, then the bid of the Purchaser for the 2025 Bonds shall be rejected. No interest on the Deposit will accrue to the Purchaser. The Deposit will be applied to the purchase price of the 2025 Bonds awarded to the Purchaser. In the event the Purchaser fails or refuses to comply with the provisions of the bid and this Notice, the Deposit shall become the property of the Corporation and the School Corporation and shall be taken and considered as liquidated damages of the Corporation and the School Corporation on account of such failure or refusal. The Purchaser will be required to make payment for the 2025 Bonds in Federal Reserve or other immediately available funds and accept delivery of the 2025 Bonds within five (5) days after being notified that the 2025 Bonds are ready for delivery, at a bank designated by the Corporation. Any premium bid must be paid in cash at the time of delivery as a part of the purchase price of the 2025 Bonds. The 2025 Bonds will be ready for delivery within sixty (60) days after the date on which the award is made, and if not deliverable within that period, the Purchaser will be entitled to rescind the sale and the Deposit will be returned. Any notice of rescission must be in writing. At the request of the Corporation, the Purchaser shall furnish to the Corporation, simultaneously with or before delivery of the 2025 Bonds, a certificate in form satisfactory to the Corporation regarding the price at which a substantial amount of the 2025 Bonds of each maturity was reoffered to the public. It is anticipated that CUSIP identification numbers will be printed on the 2025 Bonds, but neither the failure to print such numbers on any 2025 Bonds nor any error with respect thereto shall constitute cause for a failure or refusal by the Purchaser to accept delivery of and pay for the 2025 Bonds in accordance with the terms of its bid. No CUSIP identification number shall be deemed to be a part of any 2025 Bond or the contract evidenced thereby and no liability shall hereafter attach to the Corporation or any of its officers or agents because of or on account of such numbers. All expenses in relation to the printing or typing of CUSIP numbers on the 2025 Bonds shall be paid by the Corporation; provided, however, it shall be responsibility of the Purchaser to timely obtain the numbers and to pay the CUSIP Service Bureau charge for the assignment of the numbers. The Purchaser will also be responsible for any other fees or expenses it incurs in connection with the resale of the 2025 Bonds. AUTHORITY AND PURPOSE.

In addition, unless bond counsel is able, on the date of delivery, to render an opinion to the effect that (i) under existing laws, regulations, judicial decisions and rulings, interest on the 2025 Bonds is excludable from gross income under Section 103 of the Code of 1986, as amended and in effect on the date of issuance of the 2025 Bonds, for federal income tax purposes, and (ii) the interest on the 2025 Bonds is exempt from income taxation in the State of Indiana for all purposes except the Indiana financial institutions tax, the Purchaser shall have the right to rescind the sale, and in such event the Deposit will be returned.

The sale of the 2025 Bonds will be awarded to the bidder for the 2025 Bonds making a bid for the 2025 Bonds that conforms to the specifications herein and which produces the lowest True Interest Cost rate to the Corporation with respect to the 2025 Bonds. The True Interest Cost rate is that rate which, when used to compute the total present value as of the date of delivery of the 2025 Bonds of all debt service payments on the 2025 Bonds on the basis of semiannual compounding, produces an amount equal to the sum of the par value of the 2025 Bonds minus any premium bid plus any discount. In the event of a bidder's error in interest cost rate calculations, the interest rates and premium, if any, set forth or incorporated by reference in the Official Bid Form will be considered as the intended bid. In the event that the Corporation fails to receive a bid on the 2025 Bonds from at least three (3) Underwriters (as hereinafter defined), the Corporation shall so advise the successful bidder for the 2025 Bonds (such successful bidder, the \"Purchaser\"). If the Purchaser is an Underwriter intending to resell all or any portion of the 2025 Bonds to the Public (as hereinafter defined), the Purchaser must, prior to acceptance of its bid by the Corporation, either (i) agree in writing to neither offer nor sell any of the 2025 Bonds to any person at a price that is higher than the initial offering price for each maturity of 2025 Bonds during the Holding Period (as hereinafter defined) for any maturity of the 2025 Bonds or (ii) request in writing that the Corporation treat the first price at which ten percent (10%) of a maturity of the 2025 Bonds (the 10% test) is sold to the Public as the issue price of that maturity, applied on a maturity-by-maturity basis. For purposes of this Notice of Intent to Sell Bonds, (a) the term \"Public\" shall mean any person (including an individual, trust, estate, partnership, association, company, or corporation) other than an Underwriter or a related party to an Underwriter, (b) the term \"related party\" means any two (2) or more persons who have greater than fifty percent (50%) common ownership, directly or indirectly, (c) the term \"Underwriter\" means (i) any person that agrees pursuant to a written contract with the Corporation (or with the lead underwriter to form an underwriting syndicate) to participate in the initial sale of the 2025 Bonds to the Public, and (ii) any person that agrees pursuant to a written contract directly or indirectly with a person described in clause (i) of this paragraph to participate in the initial sale of the 2025 Bonds to the Public (including a member of a selling group or a party to a retail distribution agreement participating in the initial sale of the 2025 Bonds to the Public), (d) the term \"Underwriters\" means more than one Underwriter, and (e) the term \"Holding Period\" means the period starting on the date the Corporation awards the 2025 Bonds to the Purchaser (the \"Sale Date\") and ending on the earlier of (i) the close of the fifth business day after the Sale Date, or (ii) the date on which the Underwriter has sold at least ten percent (10%) of each maturity of the 2025 Bonds to the Public at prices that are no higher than the initial offering price for such maturity of the 2025 Bonds. Any underwriter executing and delivering an Official Bid Form with respect to the 2025 Bonds agrees thereby that if its bid is accepted by the Corporation (i) it shall accept such designation and (ii) it shall enter into a contractual relationship with all participating underwriters of the 2025 Bonds for purposes of assuring the receipt of each such participating underwriter of the Final Official Statement. The Purchaser shall be responsible for providing (i) in writing the initial reoffering prices and other terms, if any, to the Municipal Advisor as and at the time requested and (ii) a certification verifying information as to the bona fide initial offering prices of the 2025 Bonds to the Public and sales of the 2025 Bonds appropriate for determination of the issue price of, and the yield on, the 2025 Bonds under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, as and at the time requested by the Corporation's bond counsel. GOOD FAITH DEPOSIT. The Purchaser will be required to provide to the Corporation a wire transfer in Federal Reserve or other immediately available funds made payable to the Corporation in the amount of one percent (1.00%) of the aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Bonds sold to the Purchaser (the \"Deposit\") within twenty-four (24) hours after being notified of being the Purchaser. If the Deposit is not received by the time set forth above, then the bid of the Purchaser for the 2025 Bonds shall be rejected. No interest on the Deposit will accrue to the Purchaser. The Deposit will be applied to the purchase price of the 2025 Bonds awarded to the Purchaser. In the event the Purchaser fails or refuses to comply with the provisions of the bid and this Notice, the Deposit shall become the property of the Corporation and the School Corporation and shall be taken and considered as liquidated damages of the Corporation and the School Corporation on account of such failure or refusal. The Purchaser will be required to make payment for the 2025 Bonds in Federal Reserve or other immediately available funds and accept delivery of the 2025 Bonds within five (5) days after being notified that the 2025 Bonds are ready for delivery, at a bank designated by the Corporation. Any premium bid must be paid in cash at the time of delivery as a part of the purchase price of the 2025 Bonds. The 2025 Bonds will be ready for delivery within sixty (60) days after the date on which the award is made, and if not deliverable within that period, the Purchaser will be entitled to rescind the sale and the Deposit will be returned. Any notice of rescission must be in writing. At the request of the Corporation, the Purchaser shall furnish to the Corporation, simultaneously with or before delivery of the 2025 Bonds, a certificate in form satisfactory to the Corporation regarding the price at which a substantial amount of the 2025 Bonds of each maturity was reoffered to the public. It is anticipated that CUSIP identification numbers will be printed on the 2025 Bonds, but neither the failure to print such numbers on any 2025 Bonds nor any error with respect thereto shall constitute cause for a failure or refusal by the Purchaser to accept delivery of and pay for the 2025 Bonds in accordance with the terms of its bid. No CUSIP identification number shall be deemed to be a part of any 2025 Bond or the contract evidenced thereby and no liability shall hereafter attach to the Corporation or any of its officers or agents because of or on account of such numbers. All expenses in relation to the printing or typing of CUSIP numbers on the 2025 Bonds shall be paid by the Corporation; provided, however, it shall be responsibility of the Purchaser to timely obtain the numbers and to pay the CUSIP Service Bureau charge for the assignment of the numbers. The Purchaser will also be responsible for any other fees or expenses it incurs in connection with the resale of the 2025 Bonds. AUTHORITY AND PURPOSE. The 2025 Bonds are issued under the provisions of the Indiana Code to provide the Corporation with funds sufficient to pay the School Corporation for the reimbursement of prior improvements made by the School Corporation at a portion of the existing South Vermillion Middle School and the real property on which such buildings are located and to pay for all or a portion of the costs of issuing the 2025 Bonds.

In addition, unless bond counsel is able, on the date of delivery, to render an opinion to the effect that (i) under existing laws, regulations, judicial decisions and rulings, interest on the 2025 Bonds is excludable from gross income under Section 103 of the Code of 1986, as amended and in effect on the date of issuance of the 2025 Bonds, for federal income tax purposes, and (ii) the interest on the 2025 Bonds is exempt from income taxation in the State of Indiana for all purposes except the Indiana financial institutions tax, the Purchaser shall have the right to rescind the sale, and in such event the Deposit will be returned.

Each term bond so delivered or canceled shall be credited by the Trustee at one hundred percent (100%) of the principal amount thereof against the mandatory sinking fund obligation on such mandatory obligations and the principal amount of that term bond to be redeemed by operation of the mandatory sinking fund requirement shall be accordingly reduced; provided, however, the Trustee shall credit such term bonds only to the extent received on or before forty-five (45) days preceding the applicable mandatory redemption date. Notice of any redemption will be mailed by first class mail by the Trustee not less than thirty (30) days prior to the date selected for redemption to the registered owners of all of the 2025 Bonds to be redeemed at the address shown on the registration books of the Trustee; provided, however, that failure to give such notice by mailing or a defect in the notice or the mailing as to such 2025 Bonds will not affect the validity of any proceedings for redemption as to any other of such 2025 Bonds for which notice is adequately given. Notice having been mailed, such 2025 Bonds designated for redemption will, on the date specified in such notice, become due and payable at the then applicable redemption price. On presentation and surrender of such 2025 Bonds in accordance with such notice at the place at which the same are expressed in such notice to be redeemable, such 2025 Bonds will be redeemed by the Trustee and any paying agent for that purpose. From and after the date of redemption so designated, unless default is made in the redemption of such 2025 Bonds upon presentation, interest on such 2025 Bonds designated for redemption will cease.

Such interest rate or rates must be in multiples of one-eighth (1/8) or one-one hundredth (1/100) of one percent (1.00%).

All 2025 Bonds maturing on the same date shall bear the same rate of interest. Although not a term of sale, it is requested that each bid show the total dollar cost to final maturity and the true interest cost on the entire issue to which such bid relates.

The sale of the 2025 Bonds will be awarded to the bidder for the 2025 Bonds making a bid for the 2025 Bonds that conforms to the specifications herein and which produces the lowest True Interest Cost rate to the Corporation with respect to the 2025 Bonds. The True Interest Cost rate is that rate which, when used to compute the total present value as of the date of delivery of the 2025 Bonds of all debt service payments on the 2025 Bonds on the basis of semiannual compounding, produces an amount equal to the sum of the par value of the 2025 Bonds minus any premium bid plus any discount. In the event of a bidder's error in interest cost rate calculations, the interest rates and premium, if any, set forth or incorporated by reference in the Official Bid Form will be considered as the intended bid. In the event that the Corporation fails to receive a bid on the 2025 Bonds from at least three (3) Underwriters (as hereinafter defined), the Corporation shall so advise the successful bidder for the 2025 Bonds (such successful bidder, the \"Purchaser\"). If the Purchaser is an Underwriter intending to resell all or any portion of the 2025 Bonds to the Public (as hereinafter defined), the Purchaser must, prior to acceptance of its bid by the Corporation, either (i) agree in writing to neither offer nor sell any of the 2025 Bonds to any person at a price that is higher than the initial offering price for each maturity of 2025 Bonds during the Holding Period (as hereinafter defined) for any maturity of the 2025 Bonds or (ii) request in writing that the Corporation treat the first price at which ten percent (10%) of a maturity of the 2025 Bonds (the 10% test) is sold to the Public as the issue price of that maturity, applied on a maturity-by-maturity basis. For purposes of this Notice of Intent to Sell Bonds, (a) the term \"Public\" shall mean any person (including an individual, trust, estate, partnership, association, company, or corporation) other than an Underwriter or a related party to an Underwriter, (b) the term \"related party\" means any two (2) or more persons who have greater than fifty percent (50%) common ownership, directly or indirectly, (c) the term \"Underwriter\" means (i) any person that agrees pursuant to a written contract with the Corporation (or with the lead underwriter to form an underwriting syndicate) to participate in the initial sale of the 2025 Bonds to the Public, and (ii) any person that agrees pursuant to a written contract directly or indirectly with a person described in clause (i) of this paragraph to participate in the initial sale of the 2025 Bonds to the Public (including a member of a selling group or a party to a retail distribution agreement participating in the initial sale of the 2025 Bonds to the Public), (d) the term \"Underwriters\" means more than one Underwriter, and (e) the term \"Holding Period\" means the period starting on the date the Corporation awards the 2025 Bonds to the Purchaser (the \"Sale Date\") and ending on the earlier of (i) the close of the fifth business day after the Sale Date, or (ii) the date on which the Underwriter has sold at least ten percent (10%) of each maturity of the 2025 Bonds to the Public at prices that are no higher than the initial offering price for such maturity of the 2025 Bonds. Any underwriter executing and delivering an Official Bid Form with respect to the 2025 Bonds agrees thereby that if its bid is accepted by the Corporation (i) it shall accept such designation and (ii) it shall enter into a contractual relationship with all participating underwriters of the 2025 Bonds for purposes of assuring the receipt of each such participating underwriter of the Final Official Statement. The Purchaser shall be responsible for providing (i) in writing the initial reoffering prices and other terms, if any, to the Municipal Advisor as and at the time requested and (ii) a certification verifying information as to the bona fide initial offering prices of the 2025 Bonds to the Public and sales of the 2025 Bonds appropriate for determination of the issue price of, and the yield on, the 2025 Bonds under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, as and at the time requested by the Corporation's bond counsel. GOOD FAITH DEPOSIT. The Purchaser will be required to provide to the Corporation a wire transfer in Federal Reserve or other immediately available funds made payable to the Corporation in the amount of one percent (1.00%) of the aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Bonds sold to the Purchaser (the \"Deposit\") within twenty-four (24) hours after being notified of being the Purchaser. If the Deposit is not received by the time set forth above, then the bid of the Purchaser for the 2025 Bonds shall be rejected. No interest on the Deposit will accrue to the Purchaser. The Deposit will be applied to the purchase price of the 2025 Bonds awarded to the Purchaser. In the event the Purchaser fails or refuses to comply with the provisions of the bid and this Notice, the Deposit shall become the property of the Corporation and the School Corporation and shall be taken and considered as liquidated damages of the Corporation and the School Corporation on account of such failure or refusal. The Purchaser will be required to make payment for the 2025 Bonds in Federal Reserve or other immediately available funds and accept delivery of the 2025 Bonds within five (5) days after being notified that the 2025 Bonds are ready for delivery, at a bank designated by the Corporation. Any premium bid must be paid in cash at the time of delivery as a part of the purchase price of the 2025 Bonds. The 2025 Bonds will be ready for delivery within sixty (60) days after the date on which the award is made, and if not deliverable within that period, the Purchaser will be entitled to rescind the sale and the Deposit will be returned. Any notice of rescission must be in writing. At the request of the Corporation, the Purchaser shall furnish to the Corporation, simultaneously with or before delivery of the 2025 Bonds, a certificate in form satisfactory to the Corporation regarding the price at which a substantial amount of the 2025 Bonds of each maturity was reoffered to the public. It is anticipated that CUSIP identification numbers will be printed on the 2025 Bonds, but neither the failure to print such numbers on any 2025 Bonds nor any error with respect thereto shall constitute cause for a failure or refusal by the Purchaser to accept delivery of and pay for the 2025 Bonds in accordance with the terms of its bid. No CUSIP identification number shall be deemed to be a part of any 2025 Bond or the contract evidenced thereby and no liability shall hereafter attach to the Corporation or any of its officers or agents because of or on account of such numbers. All expenses in relation to the printing or typing of CUSIP numbers on the 2025 Bonds shall be paid by the Corporation; provided, however, it shall be responsibility of the Purchaser to timely obtain the numbers and to pay the CUSIP Service Bureau charge for the assignment of the numbers. The Purchaser will also be responsible for any other fees or expenses it incurs in connection with the resale of the 2025 Bonds. AUTHORITY AND PURPOSE.

In addition, unless bond counsel is able, on the date of delivery, to render an opinion to the effect that (i) under existing laws, regulations, judicial decisions and rulings, interest on the 2025 Bonds is excludable from gross income under Section 103 of the Code of 1986, as amended and in effect on the date of issuance of the 2025 Bonds, for federal income tax purposes, and (ii) the interest on the 2025 Bonds is exempt from income taxation in the State of Indiana for all purposes except the Indiana financial institutions tax, the Purchaser shall have the right to rescind the sale, and in such event the Deposit will be returned.

The Corporation reserves the right to amend any information contained in this Official Notice of Intent to Sell Bonds. The Corporation also reserves the right to postpone, from time to time, the date established for the receipt of bids on the 2025 Bonds. Any such amendment or postponement will be announced on the Amendments Page accessible through the View Amendments button of PARITY\u00c2\u00ae, or via TM3 and/or Bloomberg wire service and in the same manner as the notice of the sale from the Municipal Advisor as described in \"BIDDING DETAILS\" at any time prior to the date and time established for the sale of the 2025 Bonds. If any date fixed for the sale is postponed, any alternative sale date will be announced at least twenty-four (24) hours prior to such alternative sale date. BASIS FOR AWARD. The sale of the 2025 Bonds will be awarded to the bidder for the 2025 Bonds making a bid for the 2025 Bonds that conforms to the specifications herein and which produces the lowest True Interest Cost rate to the Corporation with respect to the 2025 Bonds. The True Interest Cost rate is that rate which, when used to compute the total present value as of the date of delivery of the 2025 Bonds of all debt service payments on the 2025 Bonds on the basis of semiannual compounding, produces an amount equal to the sum of the par value of the 2025 Bonds minus any premium bid plus any discount. In the event of a bidder's error in interest cost rate calculations, the interest rates and premium, if any, set forth or incorporated by reference in the Official Bid Form will be considered as the intended bid. In the event that the Corporation fails to receive a bid on the 2025 Bonds from at least three (3) Underwriters (as hereinafter defined), the Corporation shall so advise the successful bidder for the 2025 Bonds (such successful bidder, the \"Purchaser\"). If the Purchaser is an Underwriter intending to resell all or any portion of the 2025 Bonds to the Public (as hereinafter defined), the Purchaser must, prior to acceptance of its bid by the Corporation, either (i) agree in writing to neither offer nor sell any of the 2025 Bonds to any person at a price that is higher than the initial offering price for each maturity of 2025 Bonds during the Holding Period (as hereinafter defined) for any maturity of the 2025 Bonds or (ii) request in writing that the Corporation treat the first price at which ten percent (10%) of a maturity of the 2025 Bonds (the 10% test) is sold to the Public as the issue price of that maturity, applied on a maturity-by-maturity basis. For purposes of this Notice of Intent to Sell Bonds, (a) the term \"Public\" shall mean any person (including an individual, trust, estate, partnership, association, company, or corporation) other than an Underwriter or a related party to an Underwriter, (b) the term \"related party\" means any two (2) or more persons who have greater than fifty percent (50%) common ownership, directly or indirectly, (c) the term \"Underwriter\" means (i) any person that agrees pursuant to a written contract with the Corporation (or with the lead underwriter to form an underwriting syndicate) to participate in the initial sale of the 2025 Bonds to the Public, and (ii) any person that agrees pursuant to a written contract directly or indirectly with a person described in clause (i) of this paragraph to participate in the initial sale of the 2025 Bonds to the Public (including a member of a selling group or a party to a retail distribution agreement participating in the initial sale of the 2025 Bonds to the Public), (d) the term \"Underwriters\" means more than one Underwriter, and (e) the term \"Holding Period\" means the period starting on the date the Corporation awards the 2025 Bonds to the Purchaser (the \"Sale Date\") and ending on the earlier of (i) the close of the fifth business day after the Sale Date, or (ii) the date on which the Underwriter has sold at least ten percent (10%) of each maturity of the 2025 Bonds to the Public at prices that are no higher than the initial offering price for such maturity of the 2025 Bonds. Any underwriter executing and delivering an Official Bid Form with respect to the 2025 Bonds agrees thereby that if its bid is accepted by the Corporation (i) it shall accept such designation and (ii) it shall enter into a contractual relationship with all participating underwriters of the 2025 Bonds for purposes of assuring the receipt of each such participating underwriter of the Final Official Statement. The Purchaser shall be responsible for providing (i) in writing the initial reoffering prices and other terms, if any, to the Municipal Advisor as and at the time requested and (ii) a certification verifying information as to the bona fide initial offering prices of the 2025 Bonds to the Public and sales of the 2025 Bonds appropriate for determination of the issue price of, and the yield on, the 2025 Bonds under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, as and at the time requested by the Corporation's bond counsel. GOOD FAITH DEPOSIT. The Purchaser will be required to provide to the Corporation a wire transfer in Federal Reserve or other immediately available funds made payable to the Corporation in the amount of one percent (1.00%) of the aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Bonds sold to the Purchaser (the \"Deposit\") within twenty-four (24) hours after being notified of being the Purchaser. If the Deposit is not received by the time set forth above, then the bid of the Purchaser for the 2025 Bonds shall be rejected. No interest on the Deposit will accrue to the Purchaser. The Deposit will be applied to the purchase price of the 2025 Bonds awarded to the Purchaser. In the event the Purchaser fails or refuses to comply with the provisions of the bid and this Notice, the Deposit shall become the property of the Corporation and the School Corporation and shall be taken and considered as liquidated damages of the Corporation and the School Corporation on account of such failure or refusal. The Purchaser will be required to make payment for the 2025 Bonds in Federal Reserve or other immediately available funds and accept delivery of the 2025 Bonds within five (5) days after being notified that the 2025 Bonds are ready for delivery, at a bank designated by the Corporation. Any premium bid must be paid in cash at the time of delivery as a part of the purchase price of the 2025 Bonds. The 2025 Bonds will be ready for delivery within sixty (60) days after the date on which the award is made, and if not deliverable within that period, the Purchaser will be entitled to rescind the sale and the Deposit will be returned. Any notice of rescission must be in writing. At the request of the Corporation, the Purchaser shall furnish to the Corporation, simultaneously with or before delivery of the 2025 Bonds, a certificate in form satisfactory to the Corporation regarding the price at which a substantial amount of the 2025 Bonds of each maturity was reoffered to the public. It is anticipated that CUSIP identification numbers will be printed on the 2025 Bonds, but neither the failure to print such numbers on any 2025 Bonds nor any error with respect thereto shall constitute cause for a failure or refusal by the Purchaser to accept delivery of and pay for the 2025 Bonds in accordance with the terms of its bid. No CUSIP identification number shall be deemed to be a part of any 2025 Bond or the contract evidenced thereby and no liability shall hereafter attach to the Corporation or any of its officers or agents because of or on account of such numbers. All expenses in relation to the printing or typing of CUSIP numbers on the 2025 Bonds shall be paid by the Corporation; provided, however, it shall be responsibility of the Purchaser to timely obtain the numbers and to pay the CUSIP Service Bureau charge for the assignment of the numbers. The Purchaser will also be responsible for any other fees or expenses it incurs in connection with the resale of the 2025 Bonds. AUTHORITY AND PURPOSE. The 2025 Bonds are issued under the provisions of the Indiana Code to provide the Corporation with funds sufficient to pay the School Corporation for the reimbursement of prior improvements made by the School Corporation at a portion of the existing South Vermillion Middle School and the real property on which such buildings are located and to pay for all or a portion of the costs of issuing the 2025 Bonds.

In addition, unless bond counsel is able, on the date of delivery, to render an opinion to the effect that (i) under existing laws, regulations, judicial decisions and rulings, interest on the 2025 Bonds is excludable from gross income under Section 103 of the Code of 1986, as amended and in effect on the date of issuance of the 2025 Bonds, for federal income tax purposes, and (ii) the interest on the 2025 Bonds is exempt from income taxation in the State of Indiana for all purposes except the Indiana financial institutions tax, the Purchaser shall have the right to rescind the sale, and in such event the Deposit will be returned.
