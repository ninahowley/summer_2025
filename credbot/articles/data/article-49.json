Here\u2019s why.** In the first three days of the L.A. wildfires, lead levelsdetectedin the air increased 110 times, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The toxic chemical burned off of old homes, businesses, and cars, filling the air with small particles that eventually rained down over large swaths of the county. The full-scale human toll is not yet known, but experts worry about a subset of the population that may be more affected than others. The bodies of people with iron deficiency, they say, potentially absorb lead at higher rates than those who aren\u2019t iron deficient. Because of this, Black women are at increased risk. Last year, the CDCreleased dataon the prevalence of anemia in the U.S. According to the report, Black women had the highest percentage of anemia than any other racial or ethnic group. Iron deficiency is themain causeof anemia globally. Fibroids, heavy menstrual bleeding, sickle cell anemia\u2014Black women more commonly have disorders that cause them to lose blood compared to their white counterparts and other people of color. That loss in blood contributes to higher instances of iron deficiency in women of reproductive age. Black women have thehighest ratesof anemia in the U.S., theleading causeof which is iron deficiency. Heavy menstrual bleeding, a condition where excessive bleeding occurs during a menstrual period, disproportionatelyaffectsBlack women. \u201cIf you are iron deficient, you\u2019ll have four times more uptake [of lead] than someone who has the proper amount of iron in their body,\u201d said Aaron Specht, a professor at Purdue University. He studies how people get exposed to heavy metals like lead. That\u2019s because, he said, as the body searches for iron to use, it may sub in heavy metals it finds in the blood and in bone, where lead is stored. Iron is essential for a range of bodily processes, from brain function to respiration and muscle strength. It helps the body create hemoglobin, which delivers oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body. When someone is iron deficient, the body tries to preserve as much hemoglobin as it can, but at the expense of physical and cognitive abilities. \u201cCompared to any other micronutrient deficiency, iron is the one that\u2019s most discriminating between men and women,\u201d said Malcolm Munro, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA. Munro studies heavy menstrual bleeding and its effect on iron deficiency. The bevy of negative health effects associated with lead exposure are well documented. Noamountof lead in humans is considered safe, and even the smallest amounts can cause irreversible side effects. Black women sit at the intersection of policies and social determinants that drive their risk of lead exposure. Living in older housing, the lasting impacts of redlining, and hair products containing lead, impact Black women\u2019s health. The reproductive health problems that result can be life changing. \u201cWe live in a country that does not talk about reproductive health rights and justice issues,\u201d said Janette Robinson-Flint, co-founder and CEO of Black Women for Wellness, an L.A.-based nonprofit that advocates for reproductive health in California. \u201cThat\u2019s the story of this country.\u201d **Black women more at risk** The destructive Palisades and Eaton Firesstartedon Jan. 7. Data from air quality monitors showed that the levels of toxic chemicals leached into the airincreasedfrom Jan. 7-11, with peak levels of lead measured on Jan. 8 and 9, according to South Coast AQMD, an agency that regulates air quality. Houses were actively burning off old paint, bathtubs and other materials containing toxic chemicals. Niki Johnson watched from her Pomona home as smoke and ash from the Eaton Fire settled over her neighborhood. \u201cIt was panic. It was fear of having to evacuate. That was the initial fear. Then it became a health concern,\u201d she said. Johnson is iron deficient and anemic. She\u2019s used to being colder than everyone else. There are periods when she gets the urge to crunch on ice, a common symptom of iron deficiency calledpica. When she was younger, Johnson could eat her way back to normal iron levels\u2013iron- fortified foods and leafy greens were and are a staple of her diet. But these days, that\u2019s not enough. \u201cI have to take iron supplements,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I don\u2019t have to take it, I won\u2019t, but I have to now.\u201d As a Black woman, Johnson is already at heightened risk for lead exposure. Johnson also walks around with a constant source of lead leaching into her body. When she was 13, a shooting left her with a bullet lodged in her lungs. She almost didn\u2019t survive. \u201cThey called it a miracle case.\u201d She spent two and a half weeks in the hospital. Breathing felt like gurgling water, she said. When she returned home, her mother closely monitored her breathing. At school, she started dancing and running track again, but she never felt she bounced back to 100%. \u201c[I] didn\u2019t get any more first places.\u201d Today, that bullet fragment sits like a toxic reservoir in Johnson\u2019s lungs, releasing small amounts of lead into her body when activated by heat from X-rays and MRIs. \u201cThat\u2019s a very troubling case,\u201d Specht said. \u201cWhile there aren\u2019t many studies on the uptake of lead from bullet fragments, in theory, the combination of Johnson\u2019s iron deficiency and the re-exposure from the fragments could drive her body\u2019s absorption of lead. \u201cIt makes sense, with the scientific knowledge that we have, that anemia would impact the uptake [of lead] from the gut, so it likely would increase the uptake from elsewhere,\u201d he said. The gut is one predominant way lead enters the body. The other is through the lungs. Smaller particle sizes, PM2.5for instance, can make their way deep into the lungs, where they are deposited into the blood. It\u2019s easier for lead to enter the bloodstream when it\u2019s aerosolized, or suspended in air, according to Specht. Even after L.A.\u2019s air is cleared and toxins no longer measured on air quality monitors, lead exposure can persist for up to a decade. \u201cLead will unfortunately stay in the body for years to decades in their bones,\u201d Specht said. When iron stores are low, the body will remobilize the lead stored away, working as an ongoing source of lead exposure, even when the initial threat is long gone. **Levels of toxic chemicals released during fires** In the weeks since the fires, some Altadena residents havetestedtheir homes for toxic chemicals. One test of a single family home found lead levels up toeight timesmore than the EPA standard. Historically redlined communities like Altadena tend to be located near pollutants. Restrictive covenants and racist home loan policies pushed Blacks into the most undesirable parts of cities, often the most hazardous to their health. \u201cThe redlined neighborhoods are going to have [a] higher propensity for industry, are going to have [a] higher amount of roadway traffic,\u201d Specht said. Redlined neighborhoods also have older housing stock. These communities tend to have houses built before 1978, the year lead was banned from paint. In Altadena, for instance, roughly 87% of homes werebuiltbefore 1970. In 2011, the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019sAmerican Healthy Homes Surveyshowed that Black households had more lead based paint than white households. (In its updated survey from 2021, those homes had less lead-based paint than white homes, in part because the total percentage of homes white people lived in did not change.) \u201c[If] that\u2019s the only place you can live, or that\u2019s the place you have been driven to live, then whatever health situation you have will be exacerbated by that,\u201d said Robinson-Flint. But for some communities, the risk of constant exposure comes from the built environment. \u201cUnder-resourced communities of color tend to face a higher burden or higher risk of having elevated blood lead levels,\u201d said Jill E. Johnston, an environmental health professor at the Keck School of Medicine at University of Southern California. Johnston studies the impact of natural and manmade disasters on marginalized communities, including disasters where lead exposure is a factor. Lead is considered apersistent chemical, meaning it takes a long time to break down. Because lead particles are heavy, they don\u2019t travel very far, tending to settle over nearby communities. \u201cWe think about some of these urban soils as major reservoirs of lead,\u201d Johnston said. \u201cWind, construction, or other activities can really mobilize that dust back into the environment where people can breathe it in. [Particles] can go indoors, and that can continue the cycle of being exposed to it.\u201d For lead particles that have landed in people\u2019s backyards, it will have to intentionally be cleaned up\u2026 In neighborhoods actively recovering from the recent wildfires, lead found in ash and dust left behind could be moved around. Ingesting a lead particle the size of a snowflake for a child to experience measurable, and often irreversible, negative health consequences\u2013things like reduced cognitive functioning and muscle strength. While the CDC and other health organizationspoint outthat there is no safe amount of lead to ingest, adults are slightly more resilient against the heavy metal, studies have shown. Johnston served on a special committee that reviewed the fallout from the Exide factory, a car battery processing plant thatemitted7 million pounds of lead into the air and surrounding environment for nearly a century. In 2015, the government declared the site, located in the city of Vernon about 5 miles south of Downtown L.A., an environmental disaster and reached an agreement with the owner of the plant. Exide Technologies agreed to pay $50 million to clean up the site and surrounding neighborhoods. To understand lead exposure among children and pregnant women during Exide\u2019s heyday, Johnston and a team of researchers collected andstudiedbaby teeth from families who lived in neighborhoods around Exide. By looking at different layers of teeth formed during different trimesters, Johnston was able to determine how lead contamination affected mothers and their children. They found trace amounts embedded in pre- and postnatal teeth, which varied given the mothers education level and the gender of the child (females tested higher than males). In 2020, a bankruptcy court judge allowed Exide Technologies to abandon their Vernon factory, leaving the cost of the cleanup to California taxpayers. Given the history of communities of color living near industrial pollutants, Robinson-Flint isn\u2019t surprised that a natural disaster like the L.A. wildfires exposed Black women once again to toxic contaminants. \u201cIf we talk about the lead in the paint in old buildings, and we talk about the lead in the personal care products that we use, if we think about the lead in the water in Flint, Michigan, why would I be surprised?\u201d **Help shape our coverage.** AfroLA's work is driven by what our audience tells us that they need and want from us as a local news provider.
