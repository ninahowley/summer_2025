Unfortunately, lightning is responsible for claiming the lives of approximately 20 people annually, as reported by the NWS. The threat of lightning becomes more pronounced as thunderstorms draw nearer, peaking when the storm is directly overhead and gradually waning as it moves away. To ensure your safety during a thunderstorm, keep these recommendations in mind: Lightning safety plan: When venturing outdoors, it\u2019s crucial to have a lightning safety plan in place. Stay vigilant by monitoring the sky for ominous signs and listening for the telltale sound of thunder. If thunder is audible, it\u2019s a clear indication of nearby lightning. Seek a safe place to shelter, preferably indoors. Indoors safety measures: Once you\u2019ve found shelter indoors, abstain from using corded phones, electrical appliances, or plumbing fixtures, and refrain from approaching windows and doors. Lightning can follow conductive pathways, and these precautions reduce the risk of electrical surges. Wait for the all-clear: After the last lightning strike or thunderclap, wait at least 30 minutes before resuming outdoor activities. It\u2019s important to remember that lightning can strike even when a storm seems to have passed, so exercise caution. When indoor shelter isn\u2019t available: If you find yourself outdoors without access to indoor shelter during a thunderstorm, take these steps to maximize your safety: Avoid open fields, hilltops, or ridge crests, as they expose you to greater lightning risk. Steer clear of tall, isolated trees and other prominent objects. In forested areas, stay close to lower stands of trees. If you\u2019re with a group, ensure individuals are spread out to prevent lightning current from transferring between people. Camping in an open setting during a thunderstorm is strongly discouraged. If you have no alternative, set up camp in a valley, ravine, or other low-lying areas. It\u2019s crucial to note that a tent provides no protection against lightning. Do not approach water bodies, wet objects, or metal items. While water and metal don\u2019t attract lightning, they conduct electricity effectively and can pose significant risks. In summary, when facing the threat of lightning, vigilance and preparedness are your best allies. By following these guidelines, you can significantly reduce the chances of lightning-related accidents and prioritize your safety. **Rainy roadways ahead: Essential safety tips for heavy rain** When heavy rain sets in, the risk of flooding and hazardous driving conditions rises. Whether it\u2019s prolonged rainfall or rapid runoff, being prepared is essential. Here are some valuable safety tips from the NWS to ensure you stay safe in heavy rain: Beware of rapid water flow: During heavy rain, avoid parking or walking near culverts or drainage ditches, where swift-moving water can pose a serious risk. Maintain safe driving distances: Use the two-second rule to maintain a safe distance from the car in front of you and allow an extra two seconds in heavy rain. Reduce speed and drive cautiously: On wet roads, reducing your speed is crucial. Ease off the gas pedal gradually and avoid abrupt braking to prevent skidding. Choose your lane wisely: Stick to the middle lanes on multi-lane roads to minimize the risk of hydroplaning, as water tends to accumulate in outer lanes. Visibility matters: Turn on your headlights and be careful of other vehicles to the rear and in blind spot areas as they are especially difficult to see through rain-spattered windows. Watch out for slippery roads: Be extra careful during the first half hour after rain begins. Grime and oil on the road surface mix with water to make the road slippery. Keep a safe distance from large vehicles: Large trucks and buses can reduce your visibility with tire spray. Avoid tailgating and pass them swiftly and safely. Mind your windshield wipers: Overloaded wiper blades can hinder visibility. If rain severely limits your sight, pull over and wait for conditions to improve. Seek refuge at rest areas or protected spots. If the roadside is your only option, pull off as far as possible, preferably past the end of a guard rail, and wait until the storm passes. Keep your headlights on and turn on emergency flashers to alert other drivers of your position. In the face of heavy rain, these precautions can make a significant difference in ensuring your safety on the road. Remember to stay informed about weather conditions and heed guidance from local authorities for a secure journey.
