The authorization came amid mostly peaceful protests in country\u2019s second-largest city on Monday. California officials sued Trump on Monday to roll back the administration\u2019s National Guard deployment, saying the president trampled on the state\u2019s sovereignty. Local officials and Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom don\u2019t want the military deployed in the city, and the police chief said it creates logistical challenges for safely handling protests. The 2,000 Guard members authorized Monday are an addition to the 2,100 the president mobilized for the protests Sunday. Trump has also deployed 700 Marines to help them, which the Pentagon said Tuesday will cost taxpayers $134 million. Trump, a Republican, said in a social media post that the city would have been \u201ccompletely obliterated\u201d if he hadn\u2019t sent Guard members. This appears to be the first time in decades that a state\u2019s National Guard was activated without a request from its governor. Here are some things to know about the lawsuit, the protests and the troop deployments: State sues the president over troops California Attorney General Rob Bonta filed a lawsuit over the use of National Guard troops following the first deployment, telling reporters Monday that Trump had \u201ctrampled\u201d the state\u2019s sovereignty. \u201cWe don\u2019t take lightly to the president abusing his authority and unlawfully mobilizing California National Guard troops,\u201d Bonta said. He sought a court order declaring Trump\u2019s use of the Guard unlawful and asking for a restraining order to halt the deployment. Bonta has said the lawsuit became necessary once Trump escalated the number of troops, leading to growing unrest. Newsom vs. Trump Trump and his border czar, Tom Holman, traded taunts with Newsom about the possibility of arresting the governor if he interfered with federal immigration enforcement efforts. \u201cI would do it if I were Tom. I think it\u2019s great,\u201d Trump said. Newsom responded in a post on X: \u201cThe President of the United States just called for the arrest of a sitting Governor. This is a day I hoped I would never see in America.\u201d Newsom has called the presence of troops on the streets of Los Angeles both \u201cillegal and immoral.\u201d \u201cThis isn\u2019t about public safety. It\u2019s about stroking a dangerous President\u2019s ego,\u201d Newsom said on social media. In a post Monday, Newsom called the deployment of Marines \u201ca blatant abuse of power\u201d and said officials would sue to stop it. \u201cU.S. Marines serve a valuable purpose for this country \u2014 defending democracy. They are not political pawns,\u201d Newsom posted on social media. \u201cThe Courts and Congress must act. Checks and balances are crumbling.\u201d What\u2019s behind the demonstrations? The protests were sparked by Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown in the area. They started Friday in downtown Los Angeles before spreading on Saturday to Paramount and neighboring Compton. Federal agents arrested immigrants in LA\u2019s fashion district, in a Home Depot parking lot and at several other locations on Friday. The next day, they were staging at a Department of Homeland Security office near another Home Depot in Paramount, which drew out protesters who suspected another raid. Federal authorities later said there was no enforcement activity at that Home Depot. Demonstrators attempted to block Border Patrol vehicles by hurling rocks and chunks of cement. In response, agents in riot gear unleashed tear gas, flash-bang explosives and pepper balls. The weeklong tally of immigrant arrests in the LA area climbed above 100, federal authorities said. Many have also been arrested while protesting. What\u2019s happening elsewhere? Protest over immigration raids have happened in several major cities, though none have reached the scale of those in Los Angeles. Hundreds of protestors organized by the Austin, Texas, chapter of the Party for Socialism and Liberation gathered near the state Capitol before moving toward the federal building that houses an Immigration and Customs Enforcement office. Authorities appeared to use chemical irritants to disperse a crowd, and Republican Gov. Greg Abbott said authorities arrested more than a dozen protesters. \u201cPeaceful protesting is legal,\u201d Abbott posted on X. \u201cBut once you cross the line, you will be arrested.\u201d In Dallas, hundreds of people demonstrated on a city bridge for hours before police determined the rally to be \u201cunlawful.\u201d Police said one person was arrested and that charges were pending. In Boston, hundreds gathered on City Hall Plaza on Monday to protest the deployment of the National Guard in Los Angeles and the detainment of union leader David Huerta. Protesters, some holding signs reading \u201cMassachusetts stands with our neighbors in Los Angeles\u201d and \u201cProtect our immigrant neighbors,\u201d shouted \u201cCome for one, come for all\u201d and \u201cFree David, free them all.\u201d Touting Florida\u2019s efforts to lead the country in cooperating with federal immigration enforcement, Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis said law enforcement in his state is ready to crack down if demonstrations there boil over into riots, warning that \u201ccommandeering roadways\u201d isn\u2019t a form of \u201cpeaceful protest\u201d in his eyes. \u201cThe minute you cross into attacking law enforcement, any type of rioting, any type of vandalism, looting, just be prepared to have the law come down on you,\u201d DeSantis added. \u201cAnd we will make an example of you, you can guarantee it.\u201d Demonstrations also took place in Chicago, San Francisco and inside Trump Tower in Manhattan. More than a dozen were planned in all, including one that attracted hundreds in Providence, Rhode Island. What\u2019s the mood in Los Angeles? A large crowd gathered Monday in a park across from City Hall to protest the arrest of Huerta, a prominent labor leader whose detainment Friday while protesting immigration raids became a rallying cry for people angry over the administration\u2019s crackdown. He was later released on $50,000 bond. Monday\u2019s demonstrations were less raucous than Sunday\u2019s, with thousands peacefully attending the rally at City Hall and hundreds protesting outside a federal complex that includes a detention center where some immigrants are being held. The protests have been driven by anger over Trump\u2019s stepped-up enforcement of immigration laws that critics say are tearing apart migrant families. On Los Angeles Street, a major thoroughfare that runs through the city\u2019s downtown, the smell of fire hung as workers swept debris among the charred remnants of cars that were set ablaze during the protests. Police cars blocked streets as crews painted over graffiti scrawled on surrounding buildings. **Newsletter** **Local columns** **Local columns** **Almanac** **Almanac** Today is Tuesday, June 11, the 163rd day of 2024.
