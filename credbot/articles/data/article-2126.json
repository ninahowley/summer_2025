However, a Downing Street spokesperson has just put out the following, weasel-worded statement that does nothing to intervene and comes days too late: The government wants Israel to resolve the situation around the ship heading for Gaza safely, with restraint, in line with international law. Israel has already breached international law. Starmer is useless for the UK and the world and collaborating with a hostile, terrorist state again.
