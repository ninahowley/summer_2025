In the traditional model, anthropologists venture off to their field sites, do their research, and then go back to their home institutions to write up and share their findings. What might a different kind of relationship to Taiwan look like? It was a Monday evening earlier this year in mid-January and we were gathered around an oversized whiteboard. \u201cTaiwan\u2019s Economic Transformation during the KMT Authoritarian Period\u201d titled the top of the board above a timeline spanning from the end of World War II to the founding of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company in 1987. We fumbled a bit with technical terms such as \u201csmall and medium-sized enterprises\u201d and \u201ccontract manufacturing.\u201d One participant shared a story of their grandmother sewing T-shirts at her home for export abroad further down the supply chain. There were sixteen of us gathered this evening for our weekly Taiwanese history reading group, which was started specifically for diasporic Taiwanese who moved to Taipei during the Covid-19 pandemic \u2014 diasporic Taiwanese such as myself. I was pursuing graduate studies in cultural anthropology at the University of Virginia and working part-time at a local bakery when the pandemic reached the East coast during the 2020 spring semester. March, April, and May were especially stressful months of attempting to finish my coursework, coping with the financial strain of having my bakery hours cut, and adjusting to new responsibilities providing part-time childcare for my landlord\u2019s two preschoolers. My plan was to receive one of the U.S.-based fellowships I had applied for to go to Taiwan for a year to study Mandarin, further explore my research interests in Taiwan, and then return back to graduate school in the fall of 2021. But as the summer approached and Taiwan\u2019s borders showed no signs of opening to foreign students, I began looking into the process of obtaining a Taiwanese passport and Taiwan Area Resident Card as a Taiwanese national born in the United States. The summer of 2020 was filled with a mix of coordinating with my parents to translate and verify required documents such as their marriage certificate and more mundane moving preparations. It was also when the many dissonances, both personal with my department and intellectual with the discipline of anthropology, came to a breaking point. I decided to leave anthropology, which opened a different kind of space for me to engage with Taiwan. In the traditional model, anthropologists venture off to their field sites, do their research, and then go back to their home institutions to write up and share their findings. My original interests in Taiwan followed this pattern. But having abandoned North American anthropology, I wondered: What might a different kind of relationship to Taiwan look like, one that did not conform to the anthropological imperative of return? What would it take to permanently recontextualize oneself in a different geopolitical location? And what kind of new opportunities and insights might emerge from this process? With these questions in mind, I obtained my passport at the end of July and moved to Taipei in early August, just in time to start in-person Mandarin classes at the start of September. I was fortunate to have already made some connections in Taipei during a visit the previous summer, which meant that I had a social support network when I first arrived. Many of my friends were involved with the bilingual social movements publicationNew Bloom. In October, I got word thatNew Bloomhad just acquired a building in Wanhua and was looking for new members to help manage the space and plan events. Having divested from my previous academic pursuits in anthropology, I eagerly joined with a desire to explore what it would take to collaboratively create a space for intellectual, political, and creative engagement outside of the academy. We decided early on in our space programming discussions that we wanted to reach young diasporic Taiwanese like myself who moved to Taiwan during the pandemic. Most are college students and recent graduates currently in Taiwan doing some mix of working, studying, and learning Mandarin. PerhapsNew Bloomcould provide a space for diasporic Taiwanese to learn more about Taiwanese history, explore their own relationship to Taiwan, and hone a much-needed transnational perspective on contemporary Taiwanese politics. With this aspiration in mind, I took up most of the responsibility for engaging this group and soon we had a weekly reading group up and running. As our discussion time ran out, one participant fortuitously foreshadowed the topic for next week\u2019s reading group by raising the question of how we are to make sense of the relationship between economic development and democratization during the postwar period of Taiwan\u2019s history. It was as if she knew that I assigned sections from Shelly Rigger\u2019s 1999 book,Politics in Taiwan, for next week with the hope that Rigger\u2019s argument against applying the mainstream modernization hypothesis \u2014 that economic development leads to the formation of a middle class that then pushes for democratic reform \u2014 to Taiwan would stick. With a clear set-up for next week\u2019s session in place, I closed out our discussion and reminded everyone about our upcoming events: A Mandarin-English language exchange focused around the arts and activism, the start of a weekly Taiwanese Hokkien language class, an introductory talk on Indigenous peoples in Taiwan, another talk on refugee and migrant worker issues, and a Lunar New Year party for folks in Taipei. It\u2019s been about five months since that January evening, and about a year since I first considered moving to Taiwan as a national with residency rights rather than as an anthropologist primarily beholden to somewhere else. I can\u2019t help but think back to the question I gave myself last May: What would it take to permanently recontextualize oneself in a different geopolitical location? Definitely more than one year. While I\u2019ve been learning so much about Taiwan, I am painfully aware of all of the things I know I do not know. For instance, I still can\u2019t understand my maternal grandmother\u2019s Taiwanese Hokkien and my paternal family\u2019s Hakka. There are also various social issues in Taiwan that have appeared on my horizon such as the situation of Muslim communities here and the plight of Indonesianmigrant caregivers; what Taiwan can do for Hong Kongers in the wake of the national security law; how the tension between environmental conservation and energy transition goals will play out duringthe August referendum later this year; and the ongoing infringement of Indigenous rights around recent cases likethe Tama Talum constitutional interpretation on huntingand procedural consultation issues withphotovoltaic panel installations in Zhiben on the Katatipul community\u2019s land. But I have yet to pay the price of intimacy with these issues, let alone other issues about which I am unaware. As Taiwan grapples with the most recent explosion in domestic transmission cases and inches ever closer to lockdown, I\u2019ve been reminded that the Covid-19 pandemic is far from over. I wonder how other diasporic Taiwanese from the reading group are doing and what reflections they have one year on. Perhaps they too, regardless of whether their presence here is wholly or partially determined by the pandemic, feel that same resolve of staying a bit longer. There is still so much more to learn about Taiwan, about Taiwan\u2019s place in the world, about the world at large from the perspective of this particular place.
