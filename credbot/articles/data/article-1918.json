We\u2019ve tacked on an astonishing $1.6 trillion in debt in just one calendar year. The budget deficit is hovering around $1 trillion. Over the past five years, the federal government has gone from spending $4.4 trillion to spending $7.3 trillion annually. We overspent to prop up the economy during COVID-19, and then the Biden administration continued spending as if the pandemic were never-ending, thus creating a more dependent population. Despite all this, Congress continued legislating from government shutdown crisis to shutdown crisis, never getting all their appropriations bills finished on time, ignoring all the flashing red lights and sirens along the way \u2014 and salivating over the next opportunity to pass yet another multi-trillion dollar omnibus bill without any meaningful debate or reforms. **Don\u2019t Miss Out** Subscribe to our free email newsletter and get all the latest sent directly to your inbox. Well, what a difference a president makes. Since the historic reelection of President Trump, Republicans winning majorities in both houses of Congress and the creation of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), cutting government spending is suddenly the talk of the town in Washington. And believe it or not, we\u2019re starting to see some results that are providing a flicker of hope. The House recently passed Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cOne Big Beautiful Bill Act\u201d \u2014 also known as a budget reconciliation package \u2014 and the consequential legislation not only extends the enormously successful 2017 Trump tax cuts, but also saves taxpayers about $1.5 trillion through spending reforms over the next 10 years. The bill doesn\u2019t go far enough on the savings side, but in the context of the small GOP majorities in Congress, the effort should be seen as an important first step in the right direction. That being said, Mr. Trump understands that spending measures such as this can\u2019t be just a \u201cone and done\u201d undertaking. The time has come for Washington to shed its spending addiction permanently and replace it with a strict adherence to fiscal responsibility so the American people start regaining trust in government. In addition to the savings in the monumental budget bill that\u2019s now being considered by the Senate, over the past four months DOGE has also secured $175 billion in savings by conducting a long overdue \u201caudit with teeth.\u201d And it goes without saying at this point that the DOGE savings numbers would be even higher if it weren\u2019t for activist liberal judges abusing their power in the name of defending the failed status quo of unchecked wasteful spending in the bloated bureaucracy of Washington. Additionally, starting immediately, the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is sending the first of several spending rescission packages to Congress. The opening salvo will total around $9.4 billion in budget cuts targeting NPR, PBS and USAID foreign aid. The White House is also leaving the door open to using pocket rescissions to achieve additional budget cuts under the Impoundment Control Act that don\u2019t require congressional approval. After years of malpractice by the mainstream media \u2014 a big federal spending fight could come and go without the national debt even being mentioned in the news coverage \u2014 we now have financial leaders from the private and public sectors singing from the same hymnbook regarding the emergency we\u2019re facing. Treasury Secretary Bessent said recently, \u201cI came to Washington because I was concerned about the debt. The deficit is already lower than last year and will continue to decline over the next four years.\u201d Similarly, JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon called the national debt \u201ca big deal \u2026 a real problem\u201d and said common-sense entitlement program reforms that rein in waste, fraud and abuse are part of the equation to target the spending crisis. And Senator Ron Johnson, Wisconsin Republican, recently wrote in The Wall Street Journal that we must \u201cgo line by line through the entire federal budget to uncover, expose, and eliminate the hundreds of billions of dollars of waste, fraud and abuse that the DOGE effort has shown exists. If we don\u2019t, America is headed off a cliff.\u201d Indeed, Mr. Trump is providing incredible leadership on the issue of federal spending. In fact, he\u2019s working hard to change the entire fiscal attitude in Washington, and not a moment too soon. In his address to Congress earlier this year, he said, \u201cI want to do what has not been done in 24 years: Balance the federal budget.\u201d Elon Musk summed up the Trump-inspired reforms taking place perfectly when he posted on X that \u201cThe @DOGE mission will only strengthen over time as it becomes a way of life throughout the government.\u201d Let\u2019s face it, every level of government \u2014 state, county and municipal \u2014 would be much better off with its very own DOGE operation. This has become an indisputable fact almost overnight thanks to Mr. Trump and his courage to allow DOGE to succeed in its critically important mission. Now, as we look forward to FY2026 spending and a transparent appropriations process under regular order in Congress, the DOGE savings must be codified into law because going back to the mess that the Biden administration left us with isn\u2019t an option. In fact, it can be argued that this year\u2019s appropriations hearings and mark-ups are the most eagerly anticipated in decades, because Congress won\u2019t only be moving spending bills to codify all the savings and efficiencies DOGE has identified; they can also cement the DOGE mindset itself as a roadmap for future administrations and legislative sessions. The American people want to see meaningful spending reductions this year. For Congress, it\u2019s time to go big or go home. Our $36 trillion national debt must be confronted here and now. \u2022 David N. Bossie is the president of Citizens United. He served as a senior adviser to the Trump 2024 and 2020 campaigns.
