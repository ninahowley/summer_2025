Abbott Elementary School, their antics weren\u2019t all as kid-friendly as the first book Charlie Kelly ever read. On Wednesday, July 9th,It\u2019s Always Sunny in Philadelphiawill return from its longest-ever hiatus with a Season 17 premiere that will feature the cast ofAbbott Elementaryin the much-anticipated, TV-MA conclusion to the crosstown crossover. Back in January, theAbbott Elementarymid-season premiere \u201cVolunteers\u201d first merged the two Philadelphian sitcom universes, and fans of both shows were pleasantly surprised by how The Gang managed to reign in their degeneracy just enough to appeal to ABC audiences without losing their edge. Well, whenIt\u2019s Always Sunny in Philadelphiagets their turn with the crossover, no broadcast TV shushers will be able to censor the depravity that The Gang will unleash on the poor public school staffers. One such teacher,Abbott ElementarystarChris Perfetti,who plays Jacob Hill on the feel-good critical darling, recently spoke toColliderabout the crossover and promised that theAlways Sunnypremiere is \u201cobviously the R-rated version of what happened.\u201d **Don't Miss** **Here\u2019s Why You\u2019ve Never Seen the Original Open of \u2018I Love Lucy\u2019** **21 Movies That Turned Actors Into One-Hit Wonders** **15 Simplistic Myths About Exercise, Debunked** God willing, someone\u2019s gonna hang dong. In \u201cVolunteers,\u201d Perfetti\u2019s Jacob takes Charlie Kelly under his wing and quickly realizes that, despite his claims to the contrary, the Paddy\u2019s Pub janitor is an adult illiterate. Jacob and his fellow teachers band together to help Charlie reach a kindergarten-level of reading comprehension before his court-ordered community service concludes. The school even honors Charlie with a graduation ceremony as he joins the hallowed ranks of children\u2019s book readers. \u201cI\u2019m always surprised by how much pathos our show can hold. It\u2019s obviously first and foremost a comedy, but I just really loved that moment,\u201d Perfetti said of Charlie\u2019s achievement in language studies. \u201cI thought that because we were jamming with those guys that we were really going to milk as much comedy out of the episode as we could, but we still managed to make it moving and meaningful. I love that.\u201d As for howIt's Always Sunny in Philadelphiawill re-tell the events of that fateful week from The Gang\u2019s perspective, Perfetti can\u2019t wait for us to see what\u2019s in store. \u201cThat was such a gorgeous opportunity to show sides of these characters that we don\u2019t get to show on ABC or on network TV,\u201d Perfetti said of the freedom thatAlways Sunnyafforded theAbbottcast. \u201cSo I\u2019m just thrilled about it. I love all of them so much, I\u2019m such a big fan of the show that they\u2019ve made and who they are individually. It was a dream come true.\u201d Depending onwhat Dennis was doingwhile he was avoiding the diegetic camera crew, that dream may end up being a nightmare. **Tags:** News **Must Read** **Here\u2019s What the Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz Biopic Got Wrong, According to Their Daughter** **30 Wild Secrets People Have Been Keeping for Very A Long Time** **\u2018Sopranos\u2019 Star Says Ellen DeGeneres Was \u2018An A**hole From Way Back When\u2019** **Did John Mulaney Lie About This Classic \u2018SNL\u2019 Moment?** **Bryan Cranston Wore the Creator of \u2018Malcolm in the Middle\u2019 Down Until He Agreed to Write a Reboot** **22 Unlikely Roles Where Actors Far Exceeded Expectations** **VIRAL ON CRACKED** **Mary Ann Didn\u2019t Learn the Professor\u2019s Secret Until the \u2018Gilligan\u2019s Island\u2019 Star\u2019s Funeral** **30 Wild Secrets People Have Been Keeping for Very A Long Time** **21 Movies That Turned Actors Into One-Hit Wonders** **25 Funny Stories About Office Suck-Ups** **29 Jokes and Quotes for the Joke and Quote Enthusiast** **A WEEKLYNEWSLETTER OFJOKES + TRIVIA**"}
