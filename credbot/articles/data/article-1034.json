The days of the American public gathering around the television at the same time to watch a handful of shows on primetime may be coming to an end. According tothe latest numbers, streaming services Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu, and others account for 36 percent of all television viewership. In contrast, cable television accounted for 27.9 percent of viewership; broadcast television, 24.2 percent. According to Scott Hamm Duenas, a leading independent movie producer and renowned actor (\u201cFinal Wager,\u201d \u201cReBroken\u201d), the rise of streaming services has had significant consequences for how television gets made. \u201cThe entertainment industry has changed massively, especially how television shows are developed and cast,\u201d he says. In particular, television \u201cpilot season\u201d has undergone a fundamental transformation. **From \u201cpilot season\u201d to a constant demand for new content** \u201cIn the past, pilot season was usually from January to March,\u201d Hamm Duenas says. \u201cNetworks cast and filmed pilot episodes for potential new series for mainly the big four networks: ABC, NBC, CBS, and Fox. This used to be a huge time for actors \u2014 they would flock to Los Angeles from all over the country, hoping to land roles in these pilots. If a network liked a pilot, it would order a full season. This provided a huge break, possible stardom, and a big payday for those who were booked.\u201d Streaming services have deviated from this conventional timeline, however. \u201cStreaming services release shows throughout the year rather than just having a fall premiere schedule with a summer hiatus,\u201d Hamm Duenas says. \u201cThis means the demand for new content has become constant. It\u2019s now a year-round thing.\u201d Since streaming services are always hunting for appealing new content, the schedule for auditions has also changed. **The rise of remote casting** According to Hamm Duenas, new film and television projects are always looking for cast members, not just during the usual pilot season. \u201cThis has led to a more continuous casting process,\u201d he explains. Another factor changing how actors get hired is the widespread adoption of digital and remote technologies. \u201cSelf-taping has become the norm, allowing actors to audition from anywhere,\u201d Hamm Duenas says. \u201cThis eliminates the need to travel into town and visit random casting offices. The self-tape method is more convenient and cost-effective for actors and casting directors. It has been a game-changer \u2014 much of the casting process can now be done remotely.\u201d There are some exceptions to this new trend, however. \u201cIn-person auditions and chemistry reads are still needed for certain roles, especially leads or series regular roles,\u201d Hamm Duenas explains. Hamm Duenas had initially been skeptical about this casting method\u2019s effectiveness, but then the COVID-19 pandemicmade it a necessity. \u201cI thought I would hate it at first, but I\u2019ve embraced it,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t think we are ever going back, which is fine by me.\u201d Indeed, many casting directors credit video calls and self-taped auditions for enabling them to consider a larger range of talent and include people from all over the world.According to Emmy-winning casting director Robert Sterne(\u201cThe Crown\u201d), for instance, using self-taped auditions is \u201cmore inclusive economically as well as geographically. In terms of opening more doors to a wider range of actors, especially when all the creative industries have been so beleaguered, it\u2019s a force for good.\u201d Another difference between traditional television and today\u2019s streaming services is the number of episodes that shows require. **Shorter seasons, fewer writers** Hamm Duenas explains that the conventional television industry had an \u201cold-school mandatory 22-episode season.\u201d These days, however, television executives are often only willing to finance fewer episodes. \u201cNowadays, a season can be as little as six to eight episodes,\u201d Hamm Duenas says. The proper length of shows\u2019 seasons continues to be asource of controversy. While many people like the tighter storylines and sustained momentum of shorter seasons, some miss the so-called \u201cfiller\u201d episodes, considering them vital for character development and world-building. According to Hamm Duenas, another consequence of these shorter seasons is the much smaller writers\u2019 rooms. Indeed, the decline of writing positions for television was one of the mainreasons the Writers Guild of America (WGA) went on strikein 2023. **The future of streaming services** In 2015, only 52 percent of U.S. households subscribed to streaming services. Today, that figure has risen to 83 percent, with streaming services boasting 1.8 billion subscriptions in a market worth more than $670 billion. Moreover, this industry is expected to reach a value of $2.49 trillion over the next seven years. Given the popularity of these platforms, it\u2019s clear that \u201cpilot season\u201d is over, and the era of constant new content is here to stay. **Related Posts** **Bezlikiy Takes Professional Gaming To Greater Heights** **Mario \u201cWizzo\u201d Fernandez Share His Experience As Engineer For Rapper Nipsey Hussle** **Add us on Flipboard** **Recent Posts** Bone Thugs-N-Harmony Drop New Track \u201cAhh Shit\u201d: A Return to Their Roots The Monster Jam event at Macon Coliseum for 2025 promises an absolute blast of fun for the whole family.
