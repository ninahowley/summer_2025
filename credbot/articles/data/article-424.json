She joined EW in August 2022. ABC Jimmy Kimmelhas a bone to pick withWill Arnett,Jason Bateman, andSean Hayes. When the threeSmartlesspodcasters visited their pal's late-night show Tuesday, Kimmel called them out for all failing to congratulate him onrecently becoming a grandfather. \"Honestly, three of my closest friends,\" Kimmel groused to the audience as Bateman laughed. \"No acknowledgement that my daughter had a child. None whatsoever.\" Arnett immediately fessed up to the faux pas, replying, \"I know, I know.\" ABC Bateman, however, tried his best to wriggle out of the situation. \"Did you register somewhere?\" he asked, to which Kimmel replied, \"No, we didn't register! I don't want gifts! You know, just like a little text would be nice.\" When Bateman floated the idea that Kimmel's daughter might have wanted a gift, the host quickly turned the idea back on him. \"Yeah, maybe she would,\" Kimmel agreed. \"By the way, [Bateman's] daughter just graduated high school \u2014 guess who's getting a gift? Your daughter. From me.\" Unwilling to admit defeat, Bateman challenged Kimmel to name his eldest daughter. \"Franny is her name. What do you mean what's her name?\" Kimmel remarked, seemingly outraged. Bateman teased back, \"I didn't know!\" Arnett confirmed to the audience that they'd really messed up. \"So, by the way, this is true,\" he said. \"We are all legitimately good friends and none of us did anything for you for being a grandparent.\" \"That's how close we are!\" Bateman quipped. Last month, Kimmel confirmed that he missed just his second show in his 22-year tenure asLivehost in order to be there for his eldest daughter, Katie Kimmel, as she welcomed her first child, a baby girl named Patti Joan. \"Katie and her husband, Will, had a baby girl right at the time we shoot our show last night,\" Kimmel said in his monologue the next day. \"So I decided to be there instead of here.\" Sign up forEntertainment Weekly's free daily newsletterto get breaking news, exclusive first looks, recaps, reviews, interviews with your favorite stars, and more. The host added that he'd been reflecting on the teachings of his own grandfathers since joining the club, noting that they educated him how to shoplift, shoot dentures out of one's mouth, and perform haircuts using a cigarette lighter. \"It is kind of scary though to bring a child into this world and to say like, 'Okay, you're in this now at least until the year 2100. Good luck!'\" Kimmel said. \"I mean, these kids have to worry about the climate going on fire, MAGA, AI. You know what we had to worry about? The most dangerous scenarios the future held when I was a kid, honestly: quicksand, the Bermuda Triangle, and killer bees.\" Watch Kimmel grill his pals in the clip above.
