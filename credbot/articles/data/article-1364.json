BE HERE FOR US TOO.** **We\u2019re matching up to $10K for our Spring Campaign!** Two City Council leaders are requesting a probe into whether the NYPD has been violating New York City\u2019s sanctuary laws, which are supposed to bar local authorities from participating in federal immigration enforcement. In a letter sent Monday, Speaker Adrienne Adams and Oversight and Investigations Committee Chair Gale Brewer asked the Department of Investigation to look into several incidents this year where the lines between civil immigration enforcement and criminal investigations may have been blurred. \u201cWe are concerned by recent reports that information provided to federal agencies by the NYPD is now being used in civil immigration proceedings in ways that may violate New York City\u2019s laws and New Yorkers\u2019 Constitutional rights,\u201d the lawmakers wrote, adding that \u201cthese incidents appear to have resulted in multiple people being detained or sent to a prison in El Salvador without due process.\u201d The letter cites a report fromTHE CITY and Documentedabout 19-year-old Merwil Guti\u00e9rrez Flores, who the NYPD arrested and charged with gun possession in The Bronx but not prosecuted. Nonetheless, he ended up in FBI and then ICE custody, and was swiftly deported to CECOT, the notorious El Salvadoran prison. **Rep.

But Kordia was already in ICE custody when ICE made the request, and federal attorneys later used the NYPD document in its deportation case against her. **Sign up for THE CITY SCOOP!** Get the latest stories from THE CITY delivered to your inbox each morning.

A spokesperson for Mayor Eric Adams \u2014 who had been facing federal corruption charges until the Trump administrationdropped that case, and who\u2019svowed not to publicly criticize the president, which the letter-writers say has diminished public trust in his leadership \u2014 didn\u2019t immediately return a request for comment on the letter. The NYPD also did not immediately return a request for comment. Clodagh McGowan, a spokesperson for the DOI, said they received the letter and are reviewing it. In April, the Council sued theAdams administration over an executive orderallowing ICE to reopen an office on Rikers Island, which a judge has temporarily blocked from occurring. The mayor\u2019s attorneys have said the lawsuit is a political ploy by someone seeking his job, as Speaker Adams, who\u2019s term-limited out of office, is running for the Democratic mayoral nomination. While the NYPD regularly collaborates with federal agencies on criminal matters, it is barred from cooperating on civil immigration matters under a series of laws signed by former Mayor Bill de Blasio. But in an era where the Trump administration has made mass deportations a priority, with other federal agencies deputized for that effort, the Council members\u2019 letter notes mounting concerns that the NYPD might be aiding in those efforts, \u201cintentionally or unintentionally.\u201d The sanctuary city laws, they wrote, \u201care grounded in a simple principle: when immigrant communities fear cooperation with law enforcement, everyone is less safe.\u201d They added that \u201cNew Yorkers must trust that their own city government will not participate in their civil rights being violated, and these recent episodes raise serious doubts that should be urgently addressed. Any violations of city laws by our own agencies undermine the rule of law, public confidence, and public safety. Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch has repeatedly said the NYPD does not collaborate with the federal government on civil immigration enforcement butdefends collaborationon criminal matters as essential to keep New Yorkers safe. Asked last month at a Council hearing if she was considering changes to the NYPD\u2019s relationship with federal agencies in light of the Trump administration\u2019s deportation push, she had a blunt reply. \u201cThe short, straight answer to this is no,\u201d she testified. **Related** **Gwynne HoganSenior Reporter** Gwynne Hogan is a senior reporter covering immigration, homelessness, and many things in between.
