Toyota Motor is more than a 10% shareholder in one of these names and recently finalized another investment. According to Wall Street, one oil tanker stock with big-time upside just saw its owner add tens of thousands of shares. MarketBeat previews the top five stocks to own by July 1st. Insiders are making big-time purchases in three companies they work for, own, or have close business relationships with. A quote from famed investor Peter Lynch provides insight into whyinsider buyingis a signal investors should pay attention to.Lynch said, \"Insiders might sell their shares for any number of reasons, but they buy them for only one: they think the price will rise.\" This shows that insider selling isn't always a bad sign, but thatinsider buying is a clear positive sign. Under Lynch\u2019s leadership, Fidelity\u2019s Magellan Fund achieved an average annual return of more than 29% from 1977 to 1990. This massively exceeded the return of the S&P 500 Index over that period, cementing Lynch\u2019s place as a legendary investor. However, it is important to note that just because insiders think that a stock's price will rise, they can still be wrong. Nevertheless, insider buying is a notable positive signal to add to the equation when evaluating stocks. **CEO and Son Buy 200,000 Shares of High-Yield Tanker Stock** **Nordic American Tankers Today** First up isNordic American TankersNYSE: NAT. Recently, the company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Herbjorn Hansson, and its Vice President, Alexander Hansson, the CEO\u2019s son, each bought100,000 shares of the company. Overall, the Hansson family now owns 9.6 million shares of NAT, making them the company\u2019s largest private shareholder. The Hansson family purchased the shares at between $2.76 and $2.78, indicating that they see value in the stock at these prices. It appears that Wall Street analysts may agree. The two most recent updates come fromB. RileyandJefferies. They place $5 and $3 price targets on the stock, respectively. Taking the average of these two figures would imply around 45% upside in shares versus their June 6 closing price. However, Jefferies\u2019 lower target is much more recent. Nordic also often has a veryhigh dividend yield. Over the last five years, the company\u2019s trailing 12-month yield is 8.6%. Still, this number can fluctuate very substantially, as the companyfrequently changes its dividend. **Toyota\u2019s JOBY Purchase Helps Shares Take Flight** **Joby Aviation Today** Next up is electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft stockJoby AviationNYSE: JOBY. Recently, automakerToyota MotorNYSE: TMannounced it had purchasedapproximately 49.7 million shares of Joby. This is equal to $250 million, as the company purchased these shares at a price of $5.03. Notably, the news release caused shares of Joby to skyrocket nearly 29% in one day. Although Toyota is obviously not a Joby employee, this is still considered aninsider transactionas Toyota owned more than 10% of Joby\u2019s stock. Marketshave known for some timethat Toyota would invest this money; it simply has now finalized the purchase. The company will invest an additional $250 million at some point. Toyota is also not simply an investor in Joby; it is also a design and manufacturing partner as Joby develops its next-generation vehicles. This tempers thepositive signaltypically associated with insider purchases. Unlike passive investors, Toyota\u2019s broader business is somewhat tied to Joby\u2019s operational success. Toyota is a supplier of powertrains and other components to Joby. Toyota hopes that Joby\u2019s success can lead to more demand for the parts it supplies. Joby\u2019s failure would undermine this bet Toyota is making on eVTOL and the growth prospects it expects from the partnership. **Insiders Buy TKO Hand Over Fist; Analysts Slap on Price Target Upgrades** **TKO Group Today** Last up isTKO GroupNYSE: TKO. TKO is the owner and operator of the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) and World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). According to MarketBeat data, insider buying over the last 12 months comes in at $641 million. This eclipses insider selling of $17.6 million by over 36 times. In June, major shareholder Silver Lake West Voteco LLC purchased nearly 1.6 million shares of TKO. The transaction had a total value of $250 million, massively outpacing the $1.5 million of insider selling in the quarter. Despite TKO\u2019s share price more than doubling since the beginning of 2024 as of the June 6 close,analysts continue to upgrade the stock.MarketBeat tracked updatessince the company\u2019s May 8 earnings release place an average target on the stock of just under $188. This implies upside in shares of 13% versus their June 6 closing price. As Peter Lynch says, insider buying indicates that these stakeholders see an upward trajectory for these stocks. Although these insiders could be wrong, these purchases remain an importantbullish signalto consider when evaluating these names. **Should You Invest $1,000 in Joby Aviation Right Now?** Before you consider Joby Aviation, you'll want to hear this.
