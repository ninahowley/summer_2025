The move aligns with a growing push by GOP-led states and the Trump administration to improve public health through SNAP reform. **Key Facts:** USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins signed SNAP junk food ban waivers for Arkansas, Idaho, and Utah on Tuesday. These states join Nebraska, Indiana, and Iowa in restricting junk food purchases with food stamps. The initiative is part of the Trump administration\u2019s \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d campaign. Other states\u2014including Texas, Ohio, Florida, and Kansas\u2014are seeking or implementing similar restrictions. Roughly 42 million Americans rely on SNAP benefits each month, including 1 in 5 children under 17. **The Rest of The Story:** The Department of Agriculture granted Arkansas, Idaho, and Utah newauthorityto block food stamp users from spending taxpayer-funded benefits on items like soda, candy, and other ultra-processed junk food. USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins made the announcement at a Tuesday press conference, saying the decision is about encouraging healthier habits while respecting public dollars. \u201cSince my confirmation, [the USDA] has encouraged states to think differently and creatively about how to solve the many health issues facing Americans,\u201d Rollins said. These waivers now bring the total to six states that have implemented similar restrictions, all operating under guidance from the Trump administration. More states, including Colorado and West Virginia, are moving forward with similar proposals. Texas passed its own law, Senate Bill 379, to restrict SNAP purchases\u2014potentially bypassing the need for a federal waiver altogether.

For too long, taxpayer-funded food stamps have been used to buy soda, chips, candy, and other items that contribute to obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. These new waivers are a step toward aligning government assistance with personal and national responsibility. No one is saying people can\u2019t buy these items\u2014but they shouldn\u2019t do it with taxpayer dollars. If someone wants to drink a liter of cola or eat a bag of candy, that\u2019s their choice. But SNAP benefits are meant to help feed struggling Americans with nutritious food\u2014not fund bad habits. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. talks about the SNAP programs that Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins signed in an effort to Make America Healthy Again.

It\u2019s also a practical financial decision. Billions in taxpayer money should not go to items that make people sicker, ultimately raising healthcare costs and burdening public systems even more. What\u2019s refreshing is the proactive leadership from states like Arkansas and Utah. They\u2019re not just waiting for D.C. to solve their problems\u2014they\u2019re innovating. That\u2019s the kind of federalism we need more of. These states are showing that it\u2019s possible to support low-income families while still enforcing commonsense limits on government programs. And it\u2019s encouraging to see momentum building. Texas is leading the way with legislation that bans junk food purchases without even waiting for USDA approval. This sends a clear message: the public doesn\u2019t want government dollars wasted on soda and snacks. Critics may try to frame this as punitive or unfair, but it\u2019s actually the opposite. It\u2019s about protecting the long-term well-being of families and children. When 1 in 5 American kids receives food stamp support, it matters deeply what kind of food that money buys. Every state should be following this model. It\u2019s time to make health\u2014not junk food\u2014a national priority, especially when taxpayer funds are involved. **The Bottom Line:** Three more states have joined the growing movement to limit SNAP purchases to healthier food options. Backed by the Trump administration and a rising number of state legislatures, this reform effort aims to improve public health and ensure responsible use of taxpayer money. If the trend continues, we could see a national shift in how food assistance programs are managed. **Sign Up For The TFPP Wire Newsletter** **Read Next** Rep.
