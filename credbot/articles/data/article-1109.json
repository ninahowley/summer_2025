Undermining vital legislation will harm people, the environment and the economy \u2014 not to mention citizens\u2019 confidence in the bloc. AI generated Text-to-speech Share options Copy Link EMail Twitter WhatsApp Linkedin Margot Wallstr\u00f6m is a former vice president of the European Commission and former foreign minister of Sweden. Jytte Guteland is member of the Swedish parliament and former lead negotiator on EU climate law in the European Parliament. Mats Engstr\u00f6m is a former deputy state secretary at the Swedish Ministry for the Environment. The chemical industry is vital to Europe\u2019s economy and employs millions of workers across the bloc. However, too many hazardous substances remain on the market, threatening humans and nature alike. For example, the use of a group of chemicals known as PFAS \u2014 or \u201cforever chemicals\u201d \u2014 has contaminated thousands of sites and can now be measured in our bloodstreams. It is, therefore, worrying that after 18 years in force, the flagship of Europe\u2019s chemicals legislation \u2014 the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) \u2014 is becoming endangered. What the European Commission has promised is to \u201csimplify\u201d REACH. But theproposalpresented to member country experts seems more akin to deregulation and a lowering of ambitions. For instance, if put into action, the goal of phasing out substances of very high concern would be severely diluted. The main reason behind this revision is an intense lobbying campaign for European \u201ccompetitiveness.\u201d But this approach is too narrow and short-sighted. And while the intention of simplification may be good, undermining vital legislation will harm people, the environment and the economy \u2014 not to mention citizens\u2019 confidence in the EU. Among the authors of this article, one of us proposed and negotiated REACH in the early 2000s, and another was the European Parliament\u2019s lead negotiator on the EU\u2019s climate law. In both cases, we witnessed intense lobbying to slow progress, with industry pressure to weaken REACH described as \u201cthe largest ever lobbying campaign in Europe.\u201d The situation today seems widely similar in terms rolling back legislation. According to the EU Transparency Register, industrylobbying on REACH and PFAS has been very intensein recent years. However, there\u2019s no evidence that regulation is the main cause of the chemical industry\u2019s current problems \u2014 not to mention that substituting the most hazardous substances would provide a competitive advantage in future global markets. It would also help other industries, such as textiles, furniture and recycling, and several companies in these sectors have already called for a stronger REACHrather than a watered-down one. More crucially, though, what the Commission is indicating would cause harm. It would limit the authorization procedure for substances of very high concern \u2014 for example, by excluding those with widespread uses \u2014 which would result in more such substances remaining on the market and increasing risks. The Commission is also reversing its position on the 2020Chemicals Strategy for Sustainability. This is particularly evident in its weakened approach to the rapid phaseout of substances with well-established generic risks, such as neurotoxicity, or are persistent in the environment (\u201cforever chemicals\u201d). Essentially, this new approach would reduce regulatory incentive to replace these substances. But we know from experience that voluntary approaches fail to deliver results, with the burden of regulation increasingly falling on national authorities \u2014 something that could lead to fragmentation of the internal market. Take the debate on PFAS, which are endocrine disruptors and possible carcinogens. Two of us writing this piece had blood tests done a few years ago, and as expected, the results showed widespread PFAS variants at levels typical of individuals of a similar age. Other potentially dangerous chemicals, such as polychlorinated alkanes, were also present. These levels are remarkably high, and their presence is frightening because there are many gaps in research on the effects they might have. Moreover, it\u2019s almost impossible for individuals to do anything about this, as we\u2019re constantly exposed to these chemicals from so many different sources, including drinking water and food. This is why we need legislation and standards. So far, Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has promoted the \u201cOne Health approach\u201d \u2014 which links human well-being to that of animals, plants and the wider environment \u2014 in a very positive way. But we also need an ambitious policy on hazardous substances that is guided by the precautionary principle. Instead, this potential weakening of chemicals legislation is yet another example of how \u201csimplification\u201d often means deregulation. It also makes the commitment to \u201cstay the course on the Green Deal\u201d in the new Commission\u2019s policy guidelines increasingly meaningless. The Commission\u2019s own estimates show thatthe cost of cleaning up PFAS contamination across the blocwill be between \u20ac5 billion and \u20ac100 billion per year \u2014 that\u2019s just one example of the human and economic cost of inaction when it comes to hazardous substances. As such, Europe\u2019s competitiveness and its citizens would truly benefit from stronger chemicals regulations. In order to achieve that, we must first close the information gap, while the EU accelerates its phaseout of the most harmful substances and ensures regulation is properly enforced in all member countries. To restore the ambition of the EU\u2019s chemicals policy and actually protect both its people and the environment, we need urgent improvements to REACH. Only then can the EU deliver on its commitments to a toxic-free environment. **Our readers read next** **Gaza\u2019s journalists are starved into silence.

From the decorated tram train in Vienna to the giant jig-saw puzzle of Europe set up in Madrid to the two-week Festival of Europe in London, Europe has shown that it knows how to celebrate its birthday. **Constitution: from reflection to action** One year ago the French and Dutch referenda on the constitution sent shockwaves through the European Union. As a result, EU leaders called for a \u2018period of reflection\u2019. We can now draw lessons. **Sweetening the poverty pill** We have all heard from popstars and prime ministers that this is the year that could make poverty history. It was on the agenda at the G8 summit, at the UN meeting in New York on the Millennium Development Goals and it will also be discussed at the World Trade Organization\u2019s (WTO) upcoming ministerial meeting in Hong Kong. But the commitments we have seen in so far, will not suffice to \u2018walk the talk\u2019 in practice.
