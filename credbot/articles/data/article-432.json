But it turns out that might be a good thing\u2014at least for the moment.\u201d Many leading US media outlets were quick to attribute the suspension of hostilities in Gaza to incoming president Donald Trump\u2019s intervention. Ariel Kahana argued in theWall Street Journal(1/15/25) that \u201cTrump Forced Netanyahu to Make a Deal With the Devil\u201d\u2014Satan, in this formulation, being Hamas, as opposed to the parties responsible for more than 15 months ofgenocide. In theWashington Post(1/16/25), a Shadi Hamid column contended that \u201cTrump\u2019s \u2018Madman Theory\u2019 Worked in Gaza When All Else Failed.\u201d Other coverage highlighted how Trump\u2019s team coordinated with the Biden administration in its final weeks. TheJournal (1/15/25) foregrounded the \u201cpointed debate over who deserves the credit\u201d while theNew York Times(1/15/25) marveled at the \u201cremarkable collaboration between President Biden and President-elect Donald J. Trump, who temporarily put aside mutual animosity to achieve a mutual goal.\u201d ThePost(1/18/25) emphasized how incoming and outgoing administration teams with little ideological affinity\u2014and considerable political enmity\u2014embarked on a virtually unprecedented collaboration to seal the ceasefire deal. I ran a search using the news media aggregator Factiva and found that theNew York Times,Washington PostandWall Street Journalran a combined 19 articles containing the words \u201cGaza\u201d and \u201cceasefire\u201d in the five-day period from when the ceasefire was agreed upon, January 15, until it took effect on January 19. Yet these newspapers consistently ignored other crucial features of the environment in which the ceasefire came together. **\u2018Heavy losses on Israeli forces\u2019** Foreign Policy(4/9/24): The Biden administration warned Israel not to \u201cget bogged down in an endless quagmire with no way out.\u201d A major overlooked factor is that Israeli occupation forces faced fierce resistance from Hamas and other Palestinian militant groups in Gaza. Israeli media and former Israeli officials have described Israel as being in a \u201cquagmire\u201d in Gaza (Haaretz,8/15/24,9/16/24). International media reached the same conclusion (Irish Times,4/7/24;Foreign Policy,4/9/24). As it became likely that a ceasefire would come to pass,Haaretzmilitary analyst Amos Harel (1/14/25) wrote that until a deal is signed, Israel is bleeding in Gaza\u2026. The number of fallen soldiers in the area has risen to 15 in less than a week. It\u2019s not just that time is running out for the hostages. Soldiers, too, are dying without any clear reason in a prolonged operation in Northern Gaza\u2026. In practice, despite the heavy losses sustained by Hamas, it is clear that the operation has not yielded decisive results. The fighting in Jabaliya has subsided, but an estimated several dozen active [Palestinian fighters] remain there. A similar number are also active in Beit Hanoun and have managed to inflict relatively heavy losses on the Israeli forces. Despite using nearly apocalyptic force against Gaza and inflicting incomprehensible suffering on its civilian population, the US/Israeli alliance could not vanquish Palestinian resistance forces, and Israel was forced to absorb substantial casualties. However, the 19Journal,PostandTimesarticles make only one mention of Israeli losses in Gaza. That occurred in the final sentence of aPostarticle (1/15/25), which read, \u201c[Israel] says 405 soldiers have been killed during its military operation in Gaza\u201d\u2014a figure that cannot be verified because the Israeli military is secretive and censorious (+972,5/20/24). **Economic toll** CNN(10/4/24): \u201cAs the conflict spills over into the wider region, the economic costs will spiral too.\u201d Other costs were also exacted from Israel. For months, 68,000 Israelis living near the Israel/Lebanon armistice line have been evacuated from their homes because of rockets Hezbollah has fired, which the group consistently said it did to pressure Israel into a Gaza ceasefire. Although Hezbollah has stopped since it signed a \u201cceasefire\u201d with Israel (that Israel has ignored\u2014FAIR.org,1/9/25), Israelis have not gone back to their homes in the north, and are not expected to until March at the earliest (Haaretz,1/1/25). None of the 19Journal,TimesandPostpieces I examined make any reference to these almost 70,000 Israelis who have been driven from their homes by the Palestinians\u2019 Lebanese allies. The drawn-out genocide exacted economic costs on Israel as well. In October,CNN(10/4/24) said that Israelis\u2019 living standards are declining and that, prior to the events of October 7, 2023, the International Monetary Fund forecast that Israel\u2019s economy would grow by an enviable 3.4% [in 2024]. Now, economists\u2019 projections range from 1% to 1.9%. Growth [in 2025] is also expected to be weaker than earlier forecasts\u2026. Inflation is accelerating, propelled by rising wages and soaring government spending to fund the war\u2026. The conflict has caused Israel\u2019s budget deficit\u2014the difference between government spending and revenue, mostly from taxes\u2014to double to 8% of GDP, from 4% before the war\u2026. To shrink the fiscal hole, the government can\u2019t rely on a healthy flow of tax revenue from businesses, many of which are collapsing, while others are reluctant to invest while it\u2019s unclear how long the war will last. AReutersheadline (10/15/24) the next day noted that Israeli GDP growth for April\u2013June 2024 had to be \u201cRevised Down to 0.3% as Gaza War Takes Economic Toll.\u201d Nevertheless, the 19Journal,TimesandPostarticles in my data set contained zero references to Israel\u2019s economic problems. **\u2018Costs piling up for importers\u2019** New York Times(12/11/24): Yemeni attacks on cargo traffic in the Red Sea were \u201cone of the most significant challenges that shipping has faced in a long time.\u201d Along similar lines, the Yemeni groupAnsar Allah(usually referred to in Western media as the Houthis) has been intercepting commercial ships in the Red Sea since October 2023, promising to stop once there is a Gaza ceasefire. Ansar Allah\u2019s commandeering the vessels has had a substantial impact on the global economy. A Defense Intelligence Agencyreportsaid that Red Sea shipping usually accounts for 10\u201315% of international maritime trade, and container shipping through those waters declined by roughly 90% from December 2023 to February 2024. A December 2024 article in theNew YorkTimes(12/11/24) explained that Ansar Allah\u2019s actions forced shipping companies to take a route \u201cthat is some 3,500 nautical miles and 10 days longer.\u201d While \u201cWestern-led naval fleets were sent to the Red Sea\u2026the attacks continued, and commercial vessels have, for the most part, stayed away.\u201d According to the report, \u201cthe costs are piling up for importers,\u201d as shipping \u201crates have surged,\u201d and economists say that \u201cthe Houthi attacks have contributed to inflation around the world.\u201d TheTimessaid that \u201cthe cost of shipping a container from China to a West Coast port in the United States is up 217% over 12 months.\u201d Meanwhile,AP(1/3/25) reported that \u201cHouthi attacks on shipping in the Red Sea have all but shuttered an Israeli port in the city of Eilat.\u201d Nor have Ansar Allah\u2019s activities been limited to the seas. AsAPpointed out: In recent weeks, missiles and drones from Yemen have struck nearly every day\u2026setting off air raid sirensin broad swaths of Israel\u2026. The rocket fire is posing a threat to Israel\u2019s economy, keeping many foreign airlines away and preventing the country from jump-starting its hard-hit tourism industry. The 19 Gaza ceasefire articles in theJournal,TimesandPostsaid nothing about the economic and military impact of Ansar Allah\u2019s operations. An accounting of the ceasefire is incomplete if it excludes how anti-Zionist and anti-imperialist forces in the Middle East thwarted US/Israeli designs for over 15 months, levying considerable battlefield and financial losses.
