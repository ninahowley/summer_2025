That message has taken on new meaning after his daughter, Airyn, recently came out as transgender. In a recent interview withEntertainment Tonight, De Niro reflected on his evolving journey as a father. With children ranging from 57 years old to just 2, he says one rule remains constant. \u201cThe main thing is to support your kids,\u201d he said. \u201cAs long as they\u2019re not hurting themselves or doing anything destructive, you have to support them, period.\u201d His words came soon after his 29-year-old daughter, Airyn De Niro, publicly came out as transgender in an interview withThemmagazine. **Airyn\u2019s brave step into the spotlight** For most of her life, Airyn stayed out of the public eye. That changed when a media outlet outed her without her consent, misgendering her and calling her a \u201cnepo baby.\u201d In response, Airyn decided to tell her own story. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m meant to be doing this,\u201d she said about living openly. While she was nervous about how her famous family might react, her father\u2019s love gave her confidence. \u201cI love and support Airyn as my daughter,\u201d De Niro shared. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the big deal is. I love all my children.\u201d Airyn also expressed gratitude for how her parents protected her privacy as a child. \u201cThey wanted me to have as normal a childhood as possible,\u201d she said.

Speaking about little Gia, De Niro said, \u201cShe\u2019s just pure joy.\u201d He added that, while parenting changes as kids grow up, the love remains the same. De Niro and Chen began dating in 2021 and welcomed Gia quietly in 2023, making her his seventh child. Despite his fame and decades-long career, De Niro seems to find his deepest purpose in being a dad.
