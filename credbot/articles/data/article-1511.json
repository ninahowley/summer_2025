A new development could spell much larger scales of activity on American streets under287(g) agreementsbetween state and local law enforcement agencies and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). While 287(g) is mostly known for changing how arrestees are processed in county jails by sheriffs\u2019 departments, there is a mode of agreement called the\u201ctask force model\u201dwhich would make police available from local or state agencies to work as extensions of federal immigration police. This would make it vastly more likely for immigrants to get detained during routine law enforcement encounters, and massively expand how many local police could participate in federally-managed \u201csweep\u201d operations. One suchsweeprecently netted around 196 arrests of undocumented residents in Nashville. It was carried out by the Tennessee Highway Patrol and ICE using the 287(g) program. The operation\u201cquickly emptied the pews of several Spanish-speaking parishes in the Diocese of Nashville,\u201daccording to the Catholic OSV News Service:\u201cTennessee Highway Patrol officers have been conducting traffic stops to identify and detain persons in predominantly Latino neighborhoods.\u201dThis is the pattern of activity that the 287(g) program is intended to intensify, because there aren\u2019t enough federal agents to screen traffic at this scale. In our experience covering high-level police structures and programs, personnel, manpower and coordination are usually quite constrained. Various state and local governments work around this by creating key documents like\u201cmemoranda of understanding\u201d(MOU) and\u201cmemoranda of agreement\u201d(MOA). The controversial agreement between the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and ICE whichsurfaced on May 13 in American Oversight\u2019s court case, is a great example of how these MOUs work. (A section on ICE and the IRS is below.) New policies developed by President Trump\u2019s top advisers \u2013 Stephen Miller and Tom Homan \u2013 aim to expand these forces. Miller called fordeploying military and National Guard assets(archive) during the 2024 campaign, andrecently demanded ICE make 3,000 detentions a day. In recent days,more reports have surfaced(archive) that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is looking to mobilize law enforcement agencies in 25 cities to enforce more civil immigration violation detentions, andthe National Guardmay become involved.DHS is trying to get 20,000 National Guard personnel. (A section on National Guard mobilization is below.) The FBI is also possiblyallocating one-third of its agents\u2019 time in some field officesto civil immigration enforcement. Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA), U.S Marshals Service (USMS) and Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Firearms and Explosives (ATF) are similarly getting tasked this way. (We have heard additional reports about other federal agents getting pulled from normal work and put onto this kind of activity but the full picture remains murky.) Similar to the post-9/11 era, when the FBI fixated on \u2018counterterrorism,\u2019 a lot of other types of investigations these agencies are charged with, like weapons trafficking, white collar crime and human trafficking rings, will have to wait until the Trump Administration has sated itself or until other branches of the federal government intervene. Intro video (Vimeo/YouTube) **287(g) Training and Memorandum Systems** 287(g) takes the form of an agreement memorandumbetween local police and ICE. The program stalled after theDepartment of Justice made allegations back in 2011that former Maricopa County, Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio had instituted racial profiling policies, but the program was never stricken from U.S. law. Arpaio\u2019s overall model, which included spectacular mass confinement for the media and detainee exposure to desert conditions, was a forerunner of the Trump mass detention style. The American Immigration Councilwarnedat the time,\u201cthe practice of allowing local law enforcement to enforce federal immigration law increases the likelihood of racial profiling and pretextual arrests which leads to disastrous results for entire communities.\u201d Local police have turned up alongside federal immigration agents inplaces like Worcester, Massachusetts to help the feds carry out civil immigration detainers. Around 40 hours of DHS video trainingfor local police are supposed to forestall racial profiling and other racist outcomes. As of May 28, there are 628 MOAs in 40 states. 99 agencies in 25 states have\u201cjail enforcement model\u201dagreements, 223 agencies in 30 states have\u201cwarrant service officer\u201dagreements, and 306 agencies in 30 states have\u201ctask force model\u201dagreements (Excel file). An additional 72 applications are pending: 8 jail enforcement models, 23 warrant service officers, and 41 pending task force model agreements (Excel file). The interface to 287(g) could also include local regulations and policies about policing, immigration sweeps, joint operations, checklists for arrest encounters, and similar processes that should be available to the public and local policymakers. It has proven difficult for county boards and civil society groups to obtain policies about immigration sweeps. The Miami Herald outlined287(g) task force structures in detail: it\u201callows officers to challenge people on the street about their immigration status \u2014 and possibly arrest them\u2026 State and local officers are trained and deputized by ICE so they can question, detain and arrest individuals they suspect of violating civil immigration laws while officers are out policing the communities they are sworn to protect.\u201d In Florida, many police and state agencies have joined up in \u201ctask force\u201d mode, which means they can try to enforce administrative warrants from executive branch immigration officials. There was a flashy sweep a few weeks ago to promote this. Even college campus police have been getting in on these task forces, bringing federal immigration enforcement down to the student dormitory level. With little direct oversight from any bloc of public voters, college police departments will likely to be a tempting target for expanding immigration crackdown powers nationwide through systems like the 287(g) task force model. According to ICE records, Florida higher ed policing for federal civil immigration now includes task force model agreements at Florida A&M University Board of Trustees, Florida Southwestern State College Police Department, Northwest Florida State College Police Department, and New College of Florida (ahigh profile takeover target of conservative educationpolicycrusaders). The Texas Observer reported on this \u201cICE Army\u201d concept with Kristin Etter at the Texas Immigration Law Council warning it\u2019s a\u201cforce multiplier of federal immigration agencies\u201dwith\u201cofficers in the streets stopping, detaining, questioning, interrogating, arresting\u201dpeople.Law enforcement agencies have been joining287(g) task forces as well, including the Texas National Guard and Attorney General\u2019s Office. (Texas also has aseparate MOU between the Texas National Guard and U.S. Customs and Border Protectionunder 8 USC section 1103(a)(10), 1357, 28 CFR section 65.80-85 and DHS Delegation 7010.3.2, as well as the Texas governor executive order GA-54; it says they use\u201cState Active Duty\u201dstatus and authority under Title 8 to\u201cexercise the functions and duties of an immigration officer\u201dunder\u201csupervision and direction of CBP [Customs and Border Protection] officials.\u201d) Immigration rights advocates in Maryland pushedto get a moratorium on 287(g) enrollments by state and local police, for at least the third year since 2020. However, as the legislative session wound down they came up empty-handed. Maryland residentKilmar Abrego Garciahas become an international symbol this year after getting dumped into El Salvador\u2019s notorious CECOT prison. The U.S. Supreme Court ordered the Trump administration to\u201cfacilitate\u201dreturning Abrego Garcia to this country but it has not done so. Maryland sheriffs\u2019 departments are joining 287(g) en masse, particularly along the northern side of the state. According toa Bolts report, the Democratic Party-controlled Maryland Legislature may not have realized the aggressive nature of 287(g) until it was too late in the policy cycle, despite the pleas of immigration rights advocates. State Senator Karen Lewis Young toldBolts,\u201cI think if [Abrego Garcia\u2019s detention] had happened earlier in session, the 287(g) bill might have moved, because I think it gave everybody a much more realistic awareness of how dangerous that program can be.\u201dHowever, Abrego Garcia was not detained under 287(g). TheACLU of Maryland outlined how Intergovernmental Services Agreements(IGSA) are another avenue for the feds to get money to local police, as ICE rents jail beds to function as immigration detention centers. This allows Frederick, Howard and Worcester counties to generate revenue. The State Criminal Alien Assistance Program (SCAAP) is another similar revenue system. The Maryland public defender\u2019s office released a report (pdf) saying 287(g) agreements\u201cundermine due process and make innocence irrelevant by requiring local law enforcement officials to screen, interrogate and detain without judicial authorization any arrestee suspected of being removable under civil immigration law. There is no exception for someone arrested based on mistaken identity.\u201d In Pennsylvania, the suburban political bellwether of Bucks County, outside Philadelphia, is the latest 287(g) flashpoint. Sheriff Fred Harran has been trying to enter into 287(g) without approval of the county commissioners, which theACLU of Pennsylvania claims is illegal. In April,Harran confirmed he applied to get a \u201ctask force\u201d model 287(g) programfor about a dozen of his deputy sheriffs to act as ICE officers \u2014 not the more limited program that only applies to detention screening at the jail. On May 21 the Board of Commissionersvoted 2-1 to oppose this enrollment. Harrancalledthe ACLU\u201clunatics\u201dand his local critics\u201cliars\u201din a\u201ccrabby rant\u201don a right-wing podcast. On May 13, ICEapprovedHarran\u2019s 287(g) \u201cTask force model\u201d application. According to theBucks County Beacon, which uncovered the policy, Harran has not provided any written policy even though he claims his practices\u201cwould not include sweeps or raids, stating he has a \u2018policy\u2019 in place to prevent round ups.\u201dOn May 7, a number of civil society groups held a press conference in Doylestown before acounty commissioners meeting(YouTube). California,Illinois, andNew Jerseyban 287(g) agreements statewide. In Minnesota, Cass, Crow Wing and Itasca counties have\u201ctask force model\u201dagreements. Crow Wing, Freeborn, and Jackson counties have\u201cwarrant service officer\u201dagreements. Jackson is the only Minnesota county with a\u201cjail enforcement model\u201dagreement. **How Task Forces and Multi-Agency Groups Get Constructed by Officials** We can compare 287(g) to other task force systems around the government, which are not often discussed. Back on January 20, 2025, a White House \u201cPresidential Action\u201d statement,\u201cProtecting the American People Against Invasion\u201ddeclared that\u201cHomeland Security Task Forces\u201d(HSTF) should be created in all 50 states, although groups with that kind of name already existed in some areas. (Org charts for these kind of task forces are attached to the Florida plan linked below.) A DHS\u201cfinding of a mass influx of aliens\u201dwas signed on January 23, 2025 (pdf) to further justify these measures. Unicorn Riot found that theEmergency Management Assistance Compact (EMAC)is commonly used to assemble and pay for counter-protest riot squads across state lines, including for the 2024 Republican National Convention in Milwaukee and large crackdowns viaMorton Countyat Standing Rock in 2016-2017 (usingstate troopers from NebraskaandWisconsin, and police officers from various other states). The National Sheriffs Association was also an important actor insupporting EMAC activities, an adjunct effort to their\u201cinformation war\u201dagainst #NoDAPL protesters in the water protector movement against the Dakota Access Pipeline. The period around the police killing of Daunte Wright and Derek Chauvin\u2019s trial in Minnesotaalso saw a massive EMAC pull from Ohio and Nebraska. This also includes temporarily deputizing law enforcement officers, insurance provisions, and arrangements for paid services, off a menu-like arrangement, including munitions, travel, and wages. (Typically, a local sheriff or police chief, and someone in the state Department of Public Safety would sign off on EMAC requests from other states.) Earlier, we also found that theHigh-Intensity Drug Task Force (HIDTA) in Minnesota is doing biometrics for the Minneapolis policewithout a listed nexus to drug cases at all. HIDTA units can also include staff from state National Guard offices and advanced technologies to cross-index people and run investigations. HIDTA are usually not considered to be \u201cfusion centers\u201d although their capabilities are similar, if not more robust. TheWashington/Baltimore HIDTA was established in 1994by the Office of National Drug Control Policy and covers 26 counties and 11 cities, including DC and parts of Maryland, Virginia and West Virginia. Besides HIDTA there are also Joint Terrorism Task Forces (JTTF) in most metro areas. JTTF often has deputized local law enforcement with federal authorities attached, making oversight over such specially empowered local police a puzzling matter. Some areas have Urban Areas Security Initiative (UASI) groups, which are mainly a channel for requesting grants, including aDHS/FEMA standardized equipment list\u2014 some proportion of these are supposed to be for disasters but a lot of the money can go to policing, surveillance, riot control and similar items. New Jersey has achartered entity, Jersey City/Newark UASI, with an Urban Area Working Group. (pdf)More on that entity here. For much more on UASI and domestic militarization see the December 2022 report,\u201cDHS Open for Business: How Tech Corporations Bring the War on Terror to our Neighborhoods\u201cby theAction Center on Race & the Economy,LittleSis,MediaJustice, and theSurveillance, Tech, and Immigration Policing Project at the Immigrant Defense Project. The Safe Streets Task Force (SSTF) is an FBI-led task force system. (Its predecessor system wasViolent Crime Task Forces,established in 1992. By2003, it had transitioned to SSTF.) In recent days, an FBI social media account posted a photo, apparently with one of their agents wearing a Safe Streets Task Force during some kind of activity at a residence, in reference to immigration. Here is an SSTF MOU between Fort Myers and the FBI (pdf) and the 2021 agenda item (pdf). There is also some option for deputizing U.S. Marshals although the details are unclear. On May 12, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis (R) claimed that100 Florida Highway Patrol officers are now \u201cspecial deputy U.S. Marshals\u201dthat can enforce immigration laws themselves. This is connected to a 37-page Immigration Enforcement Operations Plan (pdf) although the role of deputization isn\u2019t specified within. It\u2019s worth considering how open conflicts between local governments and aggressive federal agencies will affect joint task forces like HIDTA, JTTF and UASI groups. For example,San Francisco police pulled out of JTTFfor a time in 2017. **ImmigrationOS: Where is the Data Stored for an \u201cICE Army\u201d?** Researchers have been watching ICE and other elements of Homeland Security as they work on throwing money at federal contractors, and signaling to them what kinds of projects they should work on.Palantir is extending technologies and loading in records from different agenciesacross the federal government, and to achieve this project, it could be done probably by extending contracts for the ICE Investigative Case Management system (ICM). Under the ICE TECS Modernization program, ICM replacedTECS-II, which we profiled from a leaked ICE-HSI agent manual in 2019. Many in the U.S. government have tried to make large databases cross-connected from disparate departments for political ends. These type of super-databases have been considered political hot potatoessince the Watergate era; the Privacy Act was passed in 1974to force the executive branch to outline the nature of these data systems as well as privacy protection measures. These policies were intended to prevent various abuses, like, say,Richard Nixon using the IRS to go after his enemies list. Lately, turbocharged data mining has been taking place across the executive branch with \u2018DOGE\u2019 teams andcontractors like Palantir, which is running a project dubbed \u2018ImmigrationOS\u2018 that is due to be completed in September. (Relatedcontract awards are listed here.) TheOctober 2021 Requests for Information (RFI) for ICMshows many attributes of the tracking system that Palantir seems to be enhancing (Docs are in the \u201cattachments\u201d section). More about ICM is outlined on the August 2021Privacy Impact Assessment Update. Additional ICE RFIs in recent years showed that ICE is interested in\u201crelease and reporting management,\u201dwhich includes tracking devices and\u201cmonitoring technology\u201dfor people who are not being held in detention centers. The DOGE teams and Palantir have beenworking on a\u201cmega API\u201dfor IRS records according to WIRED, a new integration that is likely connected to the infamous IRS-ICE agreement. **The IRS-ICE Agreement that Shook Tax Agency Leadership** ThisIRS-ICE agreementobtained by American Oversight was produced after the acting commissioner Melanie Krause inresigned in April in objection to this agreement. Acting chief counsel William Paul was removed and replaced with Andrew De Mello to force this through as well. Why so much resistance from the top levels? After Watergate, the Privacy Act was passed to constrain the use of \u201csystems of records\u201d for law enforcement and other purposes. This MoU tries to give assurances that everything will be handled by trained personnel. American Oversightsays\u201cthe MOU fails to include any meaningful independent oversight of when and how the information is to be shared, relying on internal compliance and self-reporting and raising questions about how the public can ensure the government is following its own rules.\u201dIt showed the government redacted that the IRS would disclose\u201caddress information\u201dof taxpayers to ICE, but the court forced these passages to be released. **\u201cProject Homecoming\u201d and Expanding Domestic National Guard Activity, via 287(g)** In a May 9 \u201cproclamation\u201d from the White House entitled\u201cEstablishing Project Homecoming,\u201d buried at the end is yet another expansion of armed force in the works. \u201c[\u2026]the Secretary of Homeland Security shall supplement existing enforcement and removal operations by deputizing and contracting with State and local law enforcement officers, former Federal officers, officers and personnel within other Federal agencies, and other individuals to increase the enforcement and removal operations force of the Department of Homeland Security by no less than 20,000 officers in order to conduct an intensive campaign to remove illegal aliens who have failed to depart voluntarily.\u201d In our research we found that the National Guard state agencies in Florida and Texas are already approved by ICE for the 287(g) task force model. Thus, the National Guard would not have to be \u201cfederalized\u201d to do more operations for the feds, it could just use 287(g). Likewise,CNN reported the Guard units could be under state authority, not federal Title 32 mobilization. As the Brennan Center explains, National Guard personnel managed by their governor and adjutant general are not subject to the limitations of the Posse Comitatus Act. It appears some of the militarized machinery here involves the concept of \u201cforce protection\u201d as a way to coerce state and local governments to cooperate with the immigration crackdown, as liberal news site Talking Points Memonoted. An ominous release from the U.S. Army on April 15, \u201cJoint Task Force Southern Guard protection cell secures the mission\u201d describes how military \u201cforce protection\u201d assets\u201caddress every possible security and safety scenario in support of a Department of Homeland Security (DHS)-led illegal alien holding operation (IAHO).\u201dSouthern Guard has been avery expensiveoperation to dump migrant detainees in the Pentagon\u2019s offshore base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba; it is led by U.S. Southern Command (SOUTHCOM). Based in Fort Huachuca, Arizona, since March,the Joint Task Force-Southern Border (JTF-SB) group is led by the U.S. Northern Command(NORTHCOM) which was created in 2002 as the military\u2019s counterpart to the Department of Homeland Security. [See our previous storieslooking at NORTHCOM and protest managementat major events.] **Tension in Newark; Additional Detention Centers Sought for ICE Operations** Recent days have been tense in Newark, New Jersey, with an ICE detention facility called Delaney Hall going into operation.Newark Mayor Ras Baraka was arrested at the facilityProtests transpiredin the aftermath of Mayor Baraka\u2019s arrest. ICE facility inspections are specifically mandated as a power for members of Congress (pdf). TheDOJ charged a Democratic member of Congress, Rep. LaMonica McIver (Newark), who sought to inspect the facility, with felony assault. On May 21, U.S. District Court Magistrate Judge Andre Espinosareprimanded federal prosecutors who charged Baraka, then officially dismissed the charges. On May 1,a federal lawsuit was heardin which New Jersey is trying to block all privately operated immigration prisons, with the state arguing it can control the private prison market, overriding the federal government\u2019s hope to run a large facility in the region that it desperately needs to scale its mass detention and deportation agenda. Since 2024 more signs have turned up thatICE is trying to expand its network of detention centers, a Freedom of Information Actlawsuitby the ACLU found (Case No.24-cv-7183).New JerseyandGEO Group detention center capacitywas exposed as well, alongside more information about the North Lake Detention Facility,\u201ca previously vacant facility in rural Michigan that will soon serve as the one of the largest ICE detention hubs in the Midwest.\u201d ICE faces significant logistical constraints in its archipelago of detention centers. A large set of centers inLouisiana, withmany reports of neglect and abuse, is central to the system. Researchers have recently found a new way tocalculate how many people are detained in these facilities. **Report: Project 2025 Working Group Proposed Huge Police Command Network Under White House Control** A new report by Beau Hodai forPhoenix New Times/Cochise Regional Newsintroduces elements of a major plan by the previously unreported Project 2025 Border Security Work Group, which offers some vision for a vast expansion and centralization of policing in the United States.Project 2025, a\u201c900-page policy \u2018wish list\u2019,\u201dwas developed by several conservative think tanks such as the Heritage Foundation to guide Trump Administration policies in a more focused fashion than the first term. The plans, developed by September 2024, include both a security policy and a propagandistic\u201cstrategic communications plan\u201dto convince the American public that dreaded\u201cterrorists\u201dare loose in the land and only their extreme policies can save the day. Hodai writes,\u201cseveral of the policy proposals contained in the documents have already been executed,\u201dincluding the IRS policy, dumping immigrants in Guantanamo, militarizing the U.S. border, and widespread revocation of immigrant parole programs and other legal status cancellations. Many\u201clines of operation\u201dare proposed in the documents, and four new tiers of command controlled ultimately by the White House: Regional Command, State Command, District Command and one Headquarters Command. In addition, Hodai found that\u201cdocuments contemplate waiving 287(g) training requirements for sheriff\u2019s deputies and municipal police working in \u2018regional command\u2019 units,\u201dbecause watching40 hoursof training videos is apparently too high a bar to cross. Not surprisingly, the documents also\u201ccontemplated invoking the Insurrection Act\u201dand\u201cmobilization of up to one million troops to aid in proposed domestic security operations.\u201d Plugging leaks in this apparatus would be a serious program as well:\u201cAn active counter-intelligence effort must be organized, integrated across all levels, and actively conducted to identify and prosecute any individuals working for and providing classified or operationally sensitive information on border security plans and activities.\u201dMore details about these documents are expected to be released in the coming weeks. A report in The Nation on May 30, 2020, showed thatthe classified network SIPRNet was used to manage some military planning during the George Floyd Uprising. People with access to anything classified on SIPRNet would risk much greater criminal penalties by sharing documents with politicians that don\u2019t have security clearances. All of these subjects can seem a bit overwhelming, but it is worth keeping in mind that the building blocks of this political situation were put in place more than two decades ago, after the September 11 attacks. Many groups are working on opposing different aspects of the immigration crackdown, including by obtaining evidence of the policies, filing lawsuits, seeking injunctions, and challenging the vast levels of spending pouring out of the executive branch.
