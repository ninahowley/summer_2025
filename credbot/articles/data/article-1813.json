A lawsuit has been filed against Norfolk Southern and more than 50 other defendants by 793 residents of East Palestine, alleging a conspiracy by Vanguard, BlackRock, Mercy Health, and Quest to deny health care to the East Palestine residents. In addition, FOIA documents from 2024 show FEMA official Jim McPherson stating, \u201cThe occurrence of a cancer-cluster in EP is not zero.\u201d This acknowledgment by McPherson contradicts the statements of other officials in the Biden administration, including EPA coordinator Michael Regan and Emergency Response Official Mark Durno, who both downplayed the seriousness of the harm caused to the residents exposed to toxic levels of dioxins and other chemicals. Scott Smith, a whistleblower client of the Government Accountability Project, toldThe HighWirelast year about an EPA cover-up in East Palestine, includingcherry-pickedtesting locations and operating as the \u201cpublic relations arm of Norfolk Southern.\u201d Smith has visited East Palestine 27 times and conducted 31 rounds of testing independent of the EPA and Norfolk Southern.The latest revelations about the CDCguidinghealthcare providers not to test residents add moreleverageto the argument that officials within the government have aided the railroad company indiminishingreal harms and cancers.On the day a \u201ccontrolled burn\u201d was conducted in 2023, a toxic plumewas releasedover16 states andpartof Canada. On February 3, 2023,thetrain operated by Norfolk Southernwithvinyl chloride and other toxic chemicals derailed in East Palestine.On February 6, \u201cofficials released toxicchemicals\u201d asreportedby CBS News, otherwise known as the \u201ccontrolled burn.\u201d On February 8, the evacuation orderwas lifted. NPRreportedthat residents could \u201csafely return\u201d to their homes following air quality testing and statements by East Palestine Fire Chief Keith Drabick and EPA official James Justice. \u201cIt was not acute exposure; it was chronic exposure,\u201d Smith said in aninterviewwith News Nation\u2019s Elizabeth Vargas on Friday. \u201cIt was ongoing exposure with the remediation and the cleanup. You hear shelter-in-place, that\u2019sjust not true. It\u2019s called forced exposure in place.They should havepermanentlybeenevacuated,or at leastbeengiventhe option.Instead, it was forced exposure over time courtesy of the very own government that is supposed to protect its citizens.\u201d In February, resident Krissy HyltontoldThe HighWirethat she knows 60 people who experience symptoms whenever they are in the East Palestine area two years after the toxic chemical plume swept over the region. She also knows four people who developed lung cancer: one man with breast cancer in both breasts, two people in their 50s with dementia, and one with brain tumors. A baby was born without sinus cavities. Alawsuitwas filedearlier this year alleging seven wrongful deaths caused by the chemical exposure. Anotherlawsuitby dog breeders alleged the incident caused 119 dog deaths and several severebirth defects, including a dog born with two heads attached to one body. Hylton was the same resident who canbeheardon an audio recording with Durnoreleasedby Status Coup News last November. In the recording, Durno admits mistakes by the EPA in response to the chemical disaster but downplayed the causality of long-term health issues. \u201cThey came back into town, and they smelled chemicals, right?\u201d Durno said.\u201cWell, if you smell chemicals, then you\u2019re exposed to chemicals, right?Even though they\u2019re well below our action levels, they\u2019re still there, and you\u2019re still exposed, right?If I could go back and change one thing \u2013 when we set up the temporary relocation program, which we did a month after the derailment, I wish we would have done that earlier on.\u201d Durno acknowledged that Norfolk Southern should not have claimed the area was safe even though the EPA testing showed levels below the agency\u2019s \u201cactionable levels.\u201d When Hylton told Durno that residents were not sick before being exposed to these chemicals, he said there was no validated link. \u201cWell, that\u2019s what you said, right?\u201d Durno said.\u201cBut again, you need to be able to \u2013 there needs to be a validated link, right?And wejustdon\u2019t have it.\u201d These are not the first admissions that the unprecedented stew of chemicals unleashed on the small village had significant health effects. CDC Official Dr. Arthur Changtoldresidents in a 2023 town hall that there is no way to remove dioxins or vinyl chloride from the body. \u201cWe may not know how to treat to get rid of vinyl chloride from the body, but we know how to treat those cancers,\u201d Chang said. Residents have advocated for more assistance with chronic health conditions and relocation expenses. The Biden administration hasbeen criticizedfor the actions by officials to downplay concerns and not provide adequate resources to support the community in the aftermath of a controlled burn.The HighWirereportedabout NGOs connected to the Biden administration thatwere brought forthwith selectedresidentswhile other residents have said they were not being heard by the administration. Still, the Trump administration hasn\u2019t fared any better in the eyes of the residents despite claims by EPA administration Lee Zeldin and Vice President J.D. Vance thatthe residents would not be forgotten. They both visited East Palestine in February on thetwo-yearanniversary of the derailment. Residents are still living in East Palestine without the means to relocate and obtain the health care they need for the chronic conditions that developed in the aftermath of the disaster. Vargas of News Nation asked Smith if Vance and Zeldin have made good on their promise to hold Norfolk Southern accountable and push for improved rail safety. \u201cNo, they haven\u2019t, but I\u2019m always optimistic to give people a chance and sit down with them,\u201d Smith said. \u201cI would love to sit down with administrator Zeldin. I don\u2019t think he knows 5% of the EPA manipulation and deception that went on, and I would loveto directly inform him.\u201d **Steven Middendorp** Steven Middendorp is an investigative journalist, musician, and teacher.
