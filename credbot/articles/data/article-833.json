According to the splash banner onPeppa Pig\u2019s YouTube channel, Baby Evie will finally be appearing on screen in new Peppa Pig Tales that will air beginning on June 20 (on Nick Jr. and YouTube). Now, with no confirmed Walmart restock in sight, parents are turning to eBay to get their hands on what\u2019s shaping up to be one of the most sought-after toys of the summer. At 11 inches tall, Evie is the perfect size for little ones to cuddle, carry, and care for. Her soft body and expressive plastic face \u2014 with that heart-shaped birthmark of hers \u2014make her feel like a real baby, while her built-in sound effects bring her to life in a way that\u2019s sweet and totally toddler-approved. She responds to nurturing play with over 20 different sound effects, from giggles and oinks to lullabies and snores. Kiddos can feed her with the included bottle, pop in her pacifier, bounce her up and down, lay her down for a nap, or tune in to the latest Peppa installments alongside the series\u2019 newest star. As they watch Peppa and George adjust to life with a new baby sister, toddlers, preschoolers, and kindergartners can mirror those moments at home, acting out scenes and playing make believe.
