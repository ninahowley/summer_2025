Independent Auditor\u00c2\u0092s Report ... Independent Auditor\u00c2's Report The Honorable Eric Chaney, Boyd County Judge/Executive The Honorable Jamie Reihs, Boyd County Sheriff Members of the Boyd County Fiscal Court Report on the Audit of the Financial Statement Opinions We have audited the accompanying Statement of Receipts, Disbursements, and Excess Fees - Regulatory Basis of the Sheriff of Boyd County, Kentucky, for the year ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes to the fi nancial statement. Unmodifi ed Opinion on Regulatory Basis of Accounting In our opinion, the accompanying fi nancial statement presents fairly, in all material respects, the receipts, disbursements, and excess fees of the Boyd County Sheriff for the year ended December 31, 2023, in accordance with the basis of accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the Commonwealth of Kentucky to demonstrate compliance with the Commonwealth of Kentucky\u00c2's regulatory basis of accounting and budget laws as described in Note 1. Adverse Opinion on U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles In our opinion, because of the signifi cance of the matter discussed in the Basis for Adverse Opinion on U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles section of our report, the fi nancial statement does not present fairly, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, the fi nancial position of the Boyd County Sheriff , as of December 31, 2023, or changes in fi nancial position or cash fl ows thereof for the year then ended. Basis for Opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAS), the standards applicable to fi nancial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards (GAS), issued by the Comptroller General of the United States, and the Audit Program for County Fee Offi cials issued by the Auditor of Public Accounts, Commonwealth of Kentucky. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor\u00c2's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statement section of our report. We are required to be independent of the Boyd County Sheriff and to meet our other ethical responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements relating to our audit. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is suffi cient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions. Basis for Adverse Opinion on U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles As described in Note 1 of the fi nancial statement, the fi nancial statement is prepared by the Boyd County Sheriff on the basis of the accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the laws of Kentucky to demonstrate compliance with the Commonwealth of Kentucky\u00c2's regulatory basis of accounting and budget laws, which is a basis of accounting other than accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The eff ects on the fi nancial statement of the variances between the regulatory basis of accounting described in Note 1 and accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, although not reasonably determinable, are presumed to be material and pervasive. Responsibilities of Management for the Financial Statement Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of this fi nancial statement in accordance with accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the laws of Kentucky to demonstrate compliance with the Commonwealth of Kentucky\u00c2's regulatory basis of accounting and budget laws. Management is also responsible for the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of a fi nancial statement that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the fi nancial statements, management is required to evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Boyd County Sheriff \u00c2's ability to continue as a going concern for twelve months beyond the fi nancial statement date, including any currently known information that may raise substantial doubt shortly thereafter. Auditor\u00c2's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statement Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the fi nancial statement as a whole is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor\u00c2's report that includes our opinions. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not absolute assurance and therefore is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with GAAS and GAS will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Misstatements are considered material if there is a substantial likelihood that, individually or in the aggregate, they would infl uence the judgment made by a reasonable user based on the fi nancial statement. In performing an audit in accordance with GAAS and GAS, we: \u00c2- Exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. \u00c2- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the fi nancial statement, whether due to fraud or error, and design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the fi nancial statement. \u00c2- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the eff ectiveness of the Boyd County Sheriff \u00c2's internal control. Accordingly, no such opinion is expressed. \u00c2- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of signifi cant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluate the overall presentation of the fi nancial statement. \u00c2- Conclude whether, in our judgment, there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Boyd County Sheriff \u00c2's ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time. We are required to communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit, signifi cant audit fi ndings, and certain internal control-related matters that we have identifi ed during the audit. Other Reporting Required by Government Auditing Standards In accordance with Government Auditing Standards, we have also issued our report dated February 5, 2025, on our consideration of the Boyd County Sheriff \u00c2's internal control over fi nancial reporting and on our tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, grant agreements, and other matters. The purpose of that report is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control over fi nancial reporting and compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the eff ectiveness of internal control over fi nancial reporting or on compliance. That report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards in considering the Boyd County Sheriff \u00c2's internal control over fi nancial reporting and compliance. Based on the results of our audit, we have presented the accompanying Schedule of Findings and Responses, included herein, which discusses the following report fi ndings: 2023-001 The Sheriff \u00c2's Fourth Quarter Report Was Materially Misstated And Required Numerous Adjustments 2023-002 The Sheriff \u00c2's Offi ce Lacks Adequate Segregation Of Duties Respectfully submitted, Allison Ball Auditor of Public Accounts Frankfort, Ky February 5, 2025 State law requires the Auditor of Public Accounts to annually audit fi scal courts, county clerks, and sheriff s; and print the results in a newspaper having general circulation in the county.

Unmodifi ed Opinion on Regulatory Basis of Accounting In our opinion, the accompanying fi nancial statement presents fairly, in all material respects, the receipts, disbursements, and excess fees of the Boyd County Sheriff for the year ended December 31, 2023, in accordance with the basis of accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the Commonwealth of Kentucky to demonstrate compliance with the Commonwealth of Kentucky\u00c2's regulatory basis of accounting and budget laws as described in Note 1. Adverse Opinion on U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles In our opinion, because of the signifi cance of the matter discussed in the Basis for Adverse Opinion on U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles section of our report, the fi nancial statement does not present fairly, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, the fi nancial position of the Boyd County Sheriff , as of December 31, 2023, or changes in fi nancial position or cash fl ows thereof for the year then ended. Basis for Opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAS), the standards applicable to fi nancial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards (GAS), issued by the Comptroller General of the United States, and the Audit Program for County Fee Offi cials issued by the Auditor of Public Accounts, Commonwealth of Kentucky. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor\u00c2's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statement section of our report. We are required to be independent of the Boyd County Sheriff and to meet our other ethical responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements relating to our audit. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is suffi cient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions. Basis for Adverse Opinion on U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles As described in Note 1 of the fi nancial statement, the fi nancial statement is prepared by the Boyd County Sheriff on the basis of the accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the laws of Kentucky to demonstrate compliance with the Commonwealth of Kentucky\u00c2's regulatory basis of accounting and budget laws, which is a basis of accounting other than accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The eff ects on the fi nancial statement of the variances between the regulatory basis of accounting described in Note 1 and accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, although not reasonably determinable, are presumed to be material and pervasive. Responsibilities of Management for the Financial Statement Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of this fi nancial statement in accordance with accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the laws of Kentucky to demonstrate compliance with the Commonwealth of Kentucky\u00c2's regulatory basis of accounting and budget laws. Management is also responsible for the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of a fi nancial statement that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the fi nancial statements, management is required to evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Boyd County Sheriff \u00c2's ability to continue as a going concern for twelve months beyond the fi nancial statement date, including any currently known information that may raise substantial doubt shortly thereafter. Auditor\u00c2's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statement Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the fi nancial statement as a whole is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor\u00c2's report that includes our opinions. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not absolute assurance and therefore is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with GAAS and GAS will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Misstatements are considered material if there is a substantial likelihood that, individually or in the aggregate, they would infl uence the judgment made by a reasonable user based on the fi nancial statement. In performing an audit in accordance with GAAS and GAS, we: \u00c2- Exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. \u00c2- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the fi nancial statement, whether due to fraud or error, and design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the fi nancial statement. \u00c2- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the eff ectiveness of the Boyd County Sheriff \u00c2's internal control. Accordingly, no such opinion is expressed. \u00c2- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of signifi cant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluate the overall presentation of the fi nancial statement. \u00c2- Conclude whether, in our judgment, there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Boyd County Sheriff \u00c2's ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time. We are required to communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit, signifi cant audit fi ndings, and certain internal control-related matters that we have identifi ed during the audit. Other Reporting Required by Government Auditing Standards In accordance with Government Auditing Standards, we have also issued our report dated February 5, 2025, on our consideration of the Boyd County Sheriff \u00c2's internal control over fi nancial reporting and on our tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, grant agreements, and other matters. The purpose of that report is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control over fi nancial reporting and compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the eff ectiveness of internal control over fi nancial reporting or on compliance.
