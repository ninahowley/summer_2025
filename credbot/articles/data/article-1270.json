Last week, the WEF published ablogpostentitled, \u201c4 steps towards creating an international agency against cybercrime,\u201d in which the authors argue for the creation of an \u201cInternational Cybercrime Coordination Authority (ICCA)\u201d to act as an intelligence sharing body between like-minded nations that also has to the power to \u201cstandardize cybercrime extradition laws\u201d and to \u201cimpose collective penalties on nations\u201d that refuse to cooperate. \u201cIt is time to formalize these efforts through the creation of an International Cybercrime Coordination Authority (ICCA), a standing alliance of nations committed to coordinated enforcement, intelligence-sharing, legal harmonization and joint disruption of cybercriminal infrastructure\u201d Written by Anna Sarnek from Amazon Web Services and Ross Haleliuk of Venture in Security, the article is part of the WEF\u2019s Center for Cybersecurity wherein the authors argue that the establishment of an ICCA would go far beyond the intelligence sharing capabilities of groups like the Five Eyes, the UN, and NATO and into the realm of collective punishment and extradition powers over nations. \u201cWhile intelligence-sharing networks like Five Eyes and global institutions like the United Nations (UN) have historically played a role in international warfare, they are not sufficient to address the scale, complexity and speed of modern digital threats,\u201d they write. To the unelected globalists, every problem is a global one, and every problem requires a global solution bathed in bureaucracy. \u201cThe ICCA would push to standardize cybercrime extradition laws, simplify digital evidence-sharing procedures and impose collective penalties (financial or diplomatic) on nations that refuse to cooperate or actively harbor offenders\u201d Using Russia as an exemplary boogeyman for providing a safe haven for cybercriminals, the WEF authors want the ICCA, once established, to \u201cimpose collective penalties\u201d on the country for being uncooperative and actively harboring offenders. \u201cIn order to stop safe havens like Russia, we need to standardize extradition laws for cybercriminals and strengthen Interpol-led cybercrime enforcement,\u201d they write. However, before setting up an international body that would operate like a hybrid International Cybercriminal Court, a Global Police Force, and a Five Eyes rolled into one, a definition of what cybercrime actually is will be needed. \u201cBuilding on top of the work by Partnership against Cybercrime (PAC), a globally recognized legal definition of cybercrime could include attacks on hospitals, emergency services, airports and public utilities, ransomware, digital extortion, financial fraud, phishing, and identity theft at scale, as well as operation of criminal infrastructure such as botnets and dark web marketplaces,\u201d the authors write. What the authors leave out is that the Partnership against Cybercrime Working Group, and the WEF in general for that matter, also considers online \u201cdisinformation\u201d as a threat to democratic governments as detailed in anInsight Reportfrom November, 2020. \u201cIn addition to financial crimes, criminals use internet based infrastructure to uphold terrorism and drug trafficking, and spread disinformation to destabilize governments and democracies\u201d Commenting on this point is investigative journalist, author, and contributing editor atUnlimited Hangout, who wrote \u201cEnding Anonymity: Why the WEF\u2019s Partnership Against Cybercrime Threatens the Future of Privacy\u201d forThe Last American Vagabondin July 2021: \u201cNotably, the WEF Partnership against Cybercrime employs a very broad definition of what constitutes a \u2018cybercriminal\u2019 as they apply this label readily to those who post or host content deemed to be \u2018disinformation\u2019 that represents a threat to \u2018democratic\u2019 governments. The WEF\u2019s interest in criminalizing and censoring online content has been made evident by its recent creation of a newGlobal Coalition for Digital Safetyto facilitate the increased regulation of online speech by both the public and private sectors.\u201d \u201cShoring up trust will be a key goal of cybersecurity efforts over the next decade. The online spread of mis- and disinformation are now core cybersecurity concerns\u201d\u201cCybersecurity will become less about protecting the confidentiality and availability of information and more about protecting its integrity and provenance\u201d If that wasn\u2019t enough, the WEF declared that online misinformation and disinformation were \u201ccore cybersecurity concerns\u201d ina reportpublished on December 5, 2023 entitled \u201cCybersecurity Futures 2030: New Foundations.\u201d According to the report, \u201cStable governments that follow through on long-term technology and cybersecurity strategies can become trusted \u2018brands,\u2019 gaining advantages in attracting talent, seizing leadership opportunities in multilateral standards-setting processes and countering disinformation campaigns.\u201d Fast forward a few years, and the desire to stamp out all narratives that don\u2019t align with unelected globalists at the UN and WEF has only intensified. For the second year in a row, the WEF has declared that the greatest global risk is misinformation and disinformation. According to the WEF Global Risks 2025report: Polarization \u201ccontinues to fan the flames of misinformation and disinformation, which, for the second year running, is the top-ranked short- to medium-term concern across all risk categories. \u201cEfforts to combat this risk are coming up against a formidable opponent in Generative AI-created false or misleading content that can be produced and distributed at scale,\u201d which was the same assessment given in the 2024 report. \u201cTheGlobal Initiative for Information Integrity on Climate Changeresponds to the commitment in the Global Digital Compact, adopted by United Nations Members States at the Summit of the Future in September 2024, which encourages UN entities, in collaboration with Governments and relevant stakeholders, to assess the impact of mis- and disinformation on the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals\u201d Last year, the G20 launched the \u201cGlobal Initiative for Information Integrity on Climate Change\u201d as an attempt \u201cto address disinformation campaigns that are delaying and derailing climate action.\u201d In the name of \u201cinformation integrity\u201d any narrative that could impede upon the UN\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is to be stamped out. According to the G20 Leaders Summit 2024,\u201cThe Initiative responds to the commitment in the Global Digital Compact, adopted by United Nations Members States at the Summit of the Future in September 2024, which encourages UN entities, in collaboration with Governments and relevant stakeholders, to assess the impact of mis- and disinformation on the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals.\u201d At the time UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres remarked that member states must work together to crush climate disinformation. \u201cWe must fight the coordinated disinformation campaigns impeding global progress on climate change, ranging from outright denial to greenwashing to harassment of climate scientists. Through this Initiative, we will work with researchers and partners to strengthen action against climate disinformation\u201d \"We must fight the coordinated disinformation campaigns impeding global progress on climate change, ranging from outright denial to greenwashing to harassment of climate scientists\" Antonio Guterres, G20 Leaders Summitpic.twitter.com/2fkR0hAP2a In 2023, the UN established a \u201cvoluntary UN Code of Conduct for Information Integrity on Digital Platforms\u201d replete with policies aimed atsilencing dissenting voiceson digital platforms under the guise of mitigating \u201cmis- and disinformation,\u201d which is conveniently lumped-in with hate speech. To give you an idea of the sheer size and scope to which the UN wishes to eradicate anything it deems \u201cmis- and disinformation,\u201d here are a few policy recommendations taken from the \u201cTowards a United Nations Code of Conduct\u201d section of thepolicy briefthat calls-on not just member states, but private groups such as stakeholders (i.e. NGOs, businesses, academia, etc.), digital platforms, advertisers, and news media to do the UN\u2019s bidding: All stakeholdersshould refrain from using, supporting or amplifying disinformation and hate speech for any purpose. All stakeholdersshould allocate resources to address and report on the origins, spread and impact of mis- and disinformation and hate speech, while respecting human rights norms and standards and further invest in fact-checking capabilities across countries and contexts. All stakeholdersshould promote training and capacity-building to develop understanding of how mis- and disinformation and hate speech manifest and to strengthen prevention and mitigation strategies. All stakeholdersshould take urgent and immediate measures to ensure the safe, secure, responsible, ethical and human rights-compliant use of artificial intelligence and address the implications of recent advances in this field for the spread of mis- and disinformation and hate speech. Member Statesshould ensure public access to accurate, transparent, and credibly sourced government information, particularly information that serves the public interest, including all aspects of the Sustainable Development Goals. Member Statesshould invest in and support independent research on the prevalence and impact of mis- and disinformation and hate speech across countries and languages, particularly in underserved contexts and in languages other than English, allowing civil society and academia to operate freely and safely. Digital platformsand advertisers should ensure that advertisements are not placed next to online mis- or disinformation or hate speech, and that advertising containing disinformation is not promoted. Digital platformsshould ensure meaningful transparency regarding algorithms, data, content moderation and advertising. Digital platformsshould publish and publicize accessible policies on mis- and disinformation and hate speech, and report on the prevalence of coordinated disinformation on their services and the efficacy of policies to counter such operations. Digital platformsshould ensure the full participation of civil society in efforts to address mis- and disinformation and hate speech. News mediashould ensure that all paid advertising and advertorial content is clearly marked as such and is free of mis- and disinformation and hate speech. In its own words, the UN is primarily concerned with what it deems to be \u201cmisinformation\u201d because the unelected globalist body is worried about information that may affect \u201cUN mandate delivery and substantive priorities,\u201d especially when it comes to criticism of its Sustainable Development Goals. To bring it all back home, the WEF is promoting the creation of anInternational Cybercrime Coordination Authority, but how long will it be until online misinformation and disinformation are considered cybercrimes? Don\u2019t agree with climate change narratives? You\u2019re a murderer for killing the planet. You\u2019re committing ecocide. Don\u2019t agree with illegal migration? You\u2019re a bigot and what you say is hate speech. Don\u2019t like what your representatives are doing and want to speak up? You\u2019re undermining the authority of democratic governments. Don\u2019t want to be a part of the UN\u2019s Agenda 2030 or the WEF\u2019s great reset? You\u2019re eroding trust in institutions. Don\u2019t want war? You\u2019re supporting dictators, thugs, and terrorists. With so-called hate speech constantly being lumped together with mis-and-disinformation regarding \u201cdigital safety,\u201d how long before the two are indistinguishable?
