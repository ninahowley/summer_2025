Under Trump, that pathway has suddenly crumbled away.** Over the past eight months, Christian Noriega, 22, collected a few thousand acorns at Blue Oak Ranch Reserve, about 10 miles outside San Jos\u00e9, sprouted them, and planted 120 seedlings of blue, valley, and black oak trees. He also planted native California brome, purple needlegrass, and blue wildrye, and cut channels along mountain ridges in the rain to prevent roads from overflooding. But Noriega\u2019s main focus was leading hikes for middle and high school students from east San Jos\u00e9, near his hometown, teaching them about the oak trees at the reserve. Like them, Noriega hadn\u2019t had much access to the outdoors while growing up. He enjoyed telling students to be like his favorite tree, a blue oak, by being \u201cresilient to change and to any challenges that face you,\u201d he says. Last week Noriega faced his own challenge\u2014a termination notice\u2014as President Donald Trump\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) slashed $400 million from the federal agency AmeriCorps and placed 85 percent of its staff on administrative leave, leaving young service-minded fellows like Noriega across the nation in the lurch. AmeriCorps employs more than 200,000 people in the United States annually, and nearly 7,000 in California. These volunteers, largely young people, perform service work from language education to disaster relief. In the Bay Area, 155 out of 806 fellows do nature-related fellowships. Ninety of those 155 fellowships have now been terminated. Bay Nature is documenting how federal money affects local nature.

While planting them, he came across a gopher snake. (Zac Harlow) Noriega worked for GrizzlyCorps, a statewide conservation program. On April 25th, California Volunteers, which administers most of the state\u2019s AmeriCorps funding, told GrizzlyCorps that its grants were gone. Across the Bay Area, DOGE cuts of about $11 million affected 28 programs and 304 locations. GrizzlyCorps fellows were told to stop working immediately, three months early. Some, like Noriega, were in the midst of applying to renew their fellowships. \u201cI\u2019m leaving behind an opportunity, not just for me,\u201d Noriega says, but also \u201cfor a bunch of students in east San Jos\u00e9 who never get to experience the outdoors. That really hurt me.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve put 45 people out in the field, some of them in pretty rural areas, with a very low salary,\u201d says GrizzlyCorps founder Ken Alex. \u201cSuddenly, they\u2019re cut off from their job and their paycheck.\u201d A paycheck that is by most measures extraordinarily low: California Volunteers\u2019 AmeriCorps-funded fellows receive a maximum stipend of $35,000 for an 11-month term. \u201cThey are taking such a big sacrifice to give back to their communities,\u201d Silver says. The perks are modest: Some fellows qualify for food stamps. Others get a temporary pause on student loans. Occasionally, they receive housing from their host organization. The programs themselves are on the chopping block, says Jake Silver, who directs the Sustainability Service Corps (SSC), which places AmeriCorps fellows with government agencies and nonprofits doing sustainability projects in the Bay Area. \u201cThis whole week has been spent trying to do whatever we can to not just save the fellows, but to save our own staff,\u201d says Silver. \u201cThere\u2019s a real possibility that this is the end.\u201d Fellows in programs that are partly funded by the state of California\u2014like the College Corps and the California Climate Action Corps\u2014may be able to finish out their terms thanks to supplemental state grant dollars, though no longer as AmeriCorps fellows, California Volunteers spokesperson Joyia Emard wrote in an email. Alex says that without federal money, GrizzlyCorps will have to raise $2 million by mid-June to run the program next year. The organization has delayed its application round for next year, and is just 20 percent of the way towards its funding goal. It is also trying to cover the remainder of the current fellows\u2019 positions. \u201cRight now, we have been able to fund our program for the month of May and are hoping to cover June and July as well,\u201d writes GrizzlyCorps director Eliza Munger. From left: Sustainability Service Corps fellow Grace Dwyer shows off a yellow-eyed ensatina (Esperanza Pimentel), and leads a group of volunteers for the Presidio Trust (Kristen Jones). Often, Silver says, the fellowships help recent college grads kick off a career in an environmental field. This year, SSC fellow Grace Dwyer, 23, was one of two fellows removing invasives, restoring native dune habitat, and leading volunteer days at the Presidio\u2014tasks that \u201cdefinitely solidified my desire to contribute to restoration work,\u201d she says. She learned about 100 different plant species along the way, and resolved to apply to graduate school. \u201cAbout a third of the fellows working in such rural communities end up getting hired by their host organizations,\u201d Alex says. \u201cAlmost all of them are working and staying in the same fields.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s really daunting to see these entry-level jobs that require five years of experience,\u201d says former GrizzlyCorps fellow Elliot Grant, who spent his fellowship at the San Francisco-based nonprofit Sustainable Conservation in 2021. Two years later, Grant was hired there as a program manager. \u201cBecause of GrizzlyCorps,\u201d he says, \u201cSustainable Conservation was able to really take a chance on me.\u201d Less than a year after he was hired, he started mentoring his own GrizzlyCorps fellow, whom he hired and now supervises. GrizzlyCorps fellows work in \u201csome of the most rural parts of the state that often are ignored,\u201d says Alex. In the Bay Area, local places seeing impacts include field stations at University of California natural reserves: Blue Oak Ranch Reserve in San Jos\u00e9, Point Reyes Field Station, and Hastings Natural History Reservation in Carmel. Their facilities serve as temporary homes for visitors and researchers, allowing people to access natural areas. \u201cOur staff are spread thin,\u201d says Neetha Iyer, an administrative director for the reserve system. GrizzlyCorps fellows \u201callow us to expand what we\u2019re able to offer as an education and research facility,\u201d she says. At Hastings Natural History Reservation in Carmel Valley, GrizzlyCorps fellow Natalia Vald\u00e9s Heredia was waiting to plant hundreds of blue oak seedlings at the end of this year, from thousands of acorns she collected throughout the property. They have been germinating in greenhouses for months. While she waited, she kept her plate full: fixing leaky faucets, whacking weeds, removing downed trees with a chainsaw after a fire in October, and tracking wildlife with a dozen camera traps that she set up\u2014capturing mountain lions, bobcats, wild pigs, and raptors. \u201cI loved my position here,\u201d says Vald\u00e9s Heredia, 25. Now the seedlings may never be planted. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the staff or the capacity to do that,\u201d says Jen Hunter, the reserve resident director, who is also the only other staff member living with Vald\u00e9s Heredia at the reserve. Vald\u00e9s Heredia\u2019s fellowship \u201cgave us an opportunity to get some of these big projects done.\u201d GrizzlyCorps member Emily Dewing, 25, was in the middle of quite a big project: the GIS mapping of fire resilience projects, aging infrastructure, bird tagging spots, and more across 5,000 acres of land for Audubon Canyon Ranch in Marin and Sonoma. These projects would help the ranch be more efficient when planning future projects, says ecologist Scott Jennings, especially for managing fire-resistant landscapes. Plus, \u201cI was really looking forward to having completed projects that I would be able to show on my applications to schools and on my applications to other jobs,\u201d Dewing says. With her work incomplete, she feels stuck. \u201cNow, it doesn\u2019t look like I\u2019ll be able to save up enough money for my masters\u201d in a GIS-related field, Dewing says. She\u2019s been applying to jobs without much success. While filling out one application, the online job posting vanished due to federal cuts to that program. Dewing, Noriega, and Dwyer say they are hoping for seasonal work, since a \u201clot of the long-term projects that are being federally funded are disappearing,\u201d says Dewing. \u201cIf it comes to it,\u201d she says, \u201cI will be applying to the grocery store nearest to me.\u201d At the Carmel reserve, Vald\u00e9s Heredia was inspired by her camera trap work. \u201cI was hoping to use my money to go to grad school,\u201d she says. Two weeks ago, she sent a renewal letter to GrizzlyCorps, in hopes of continuing at the reserve for another year. Hunter, her mentor, sees future opportunities for aspiring environmental scientists like Vald\u00e9s Heredia dwindling as Trump slashes agencies and research. \u201cThe thing that makes me nervous is that if this was [Vald\u00e9s Heredia\u2019s] opportunity to kind of get that type of experience, and it\u2019s been cut short,\u201d says Hunter, \u201cI\u2019m not sure she\u2019s going to have another chance to tap into that.\u201d From left: GrizzlyCorps fellow Natalia Vald\u00e9s Heredia fixes technical difficulties with a battery box, on one of her first days of work last September at Hastings Natural History Reservation in Carmel; and posing after a chainsaw training, which she put to use soon after a fire at the reservation in October. (Jen Hunter) Vald\u00e9s Heredia sees another way forward, an option that means not just saying goodbye to the Corps, but also to America as a place of opportunity. \u201cIt would honestly break my heart to think of doing anything other than environmental sciences,\u201d says Vald\u00e9s Heredia. She\u2019s looking at Canada or Australia as backup options. \u201cIf I really need to go that route,\u201d she says, \u201cI\u2019m not afraid to.\u201d California is fighting back against the cuts. On April 25, Gov. Gavin Newsom issued a statement saying that \u201cthe federal government is giving the middle finger to service. We will serve them with a lawsuit.\u201d On April 29, the District of Columbia and 24 Democratic-governed states, co-led by California, filed that lawsuit, arguing that the president does not have authority to effectively eliminate a service that Congress created.
