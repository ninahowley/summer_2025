A group of Dutch citizens staged an unauthorized border control operation this weekend between Ter Apel and the German village of R\u00fctenbrock, citing frustration with what they describe as uncontrolled illegal immigration. Wearing reflective clothing and wielding torches, the group of around 12 men began stopping vehicles on Saturday evening along the N366, a key route between Germany and the Netherlands. The vigilantes, who pulled cars over and even inspected trunks, say they took action because authorities are failing to secure the border and stem the flow of asylum seekers entering the country.\u201cNothing is happening. Then we\u2019ll do it ourselves,\u201dsaid one activist, as cited byAlgemeen Dagblad. The action, although brief, drew sharp criticism from police and government officials. The municipality of Westerwolde and Dutch police released a joint statement declaring that \u201ccitizens are forbidden to stop cars\u201d and that such actions \u201ccreate enormously dangerous situations\u201d and are \u201creally unacceptable.\u201dThe vigilantes are believed to have violated road traffic laws, though it is unclear whether any formal charges will be brought. \ud83c\uddf3\ud83c\uddf1\u203c\ufe0f Dutch vigilantes fed up with illegal immigration set up their own border controls with Germany this weekend, between Ter Apel and R\u00fctenbrock. Geert Wilders, the PVV leader who just collapsed the Dutch government over asylum red lines, called it a \"fantastic initiative.\"pic.twitter.com/FfjTtkuO6k \u2014 Remix News & Views (@RMXnews)June 8, 2025 One vehicle stopped by the group turned out to be a German police van. The officers promptly ordered the group to leave German soil, threatening to tow their vehicles if they did not comply. The activists relocated their checkpoint to a parking lot on the Dutch side of the border and continued stopping traffic from Germany. The group, reportedly organized via Facebook, primarily includes residents from the municipality of Westerwolde. Outgoing Justice and Migration Minister David van Weel, of the center-right VVD, responded by urging the group to stop. \u201cI understand the frustration, but I really call on this group not to do this,\u201d he said. \u201cLet the police and military police do their job and abide by the law.\u201d Van Weel acknowledged the Netherlands \u201ccannot handle the current influx,\u201d but insisted that border enforcement must remain the responsibility of the authorities. Mayor Jaap Velema of Westerwolde expressed sympathy for the frustrations, citing \u201cthe lack of solutions to the crisis in asylum reception,\u201d but warned:\u201cThis is not the way to express frustrations. We can\u2019t all drive through red lights either.\u201d Geert Wilders, leader of the anti-immigration PVV party,praised the citizens\u2019 actions on X, calling it a \u201cfantastic initiative\u201dand adding, \u201cIf [Prime Minister] Schoof and the VVD do not immediately deploy the army en masse for this, we will have to do it ourselves! I would like to participate next time!\u201d Wilders has been vocal about tightening the Dutch asylum regime. His party recently withdrew from the governing coalition after other parties refused to adopt his 10-point plan for what he called \u201cthe strictest asylum policy ever.\u201d The cabinet\u2019s collapse triggered early elections, which are scheduled to take place on Oct. 29, 2025. Van Weel reiterated the government\u2019s focus on \u201cstricter asylum laws and better border control.\u201d Wilders, however, responded by accusing him of inaction. \u201cWeakling. You don\u2019t do anything at all. You could have had the army guard the borders now and sent away all asylum seekers on the basis of Article 72 TFEU, just like the Germans do,\u201d he posted on social media. \u201cIf people are frustrated, it is because the VVD is completely failing.\u201d Ter Apel is the home of the Netherlands\u2019 largest asylum reception center, where officially around 2,000 asylum seekers are currently housed. In March, residents of Nieuw-Weerdinge, a Dutch town between Ter Apel and the nearest city of Emmen, launched a fundraiser in support of a 51-year-old local man convicted of assaulting an Algerian asylum seeker during an attempted citizen\u2019s arrest. He was found to have confronted an Algerian national from the reception center for allegedly stealing \u20ac40 from a delivery van. The town has established its own neighborhood watch app used by concerned residents to ensure anyone acting suspiciously in the area is identified after a surge in crime.

They certainly aren\u2019t doing them well. Most police are secure in their finances and therefore secure in themselves with \u201ckeeping the peace.\u201d People will naturally encounter resistance from the police for trying to fix the genocidal policies with which the state has sabotaged them. Good point.Even though the police don\u2019t generally make a lot of money they want those jobs because it\u2019s a steady paycheck with benefits and not labor intensive.Therefore they are a group that is more ready to go against their innermost beliefs and support the state that employs them.
