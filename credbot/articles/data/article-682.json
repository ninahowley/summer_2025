It allows me to hone in on my family history,\u201d Julie Ly said.** MOORHEAD \u2014 When Julie Ly plays Maria in \u201cThe Sound of Music,\u201d she\u2019s not just starring in her first ActUp Theatre production, she\u2019s making her debut in musical theater. \u201cMaria is one of those roles everyone knows. It\u2019s such an incredible role with all of the classics she sings,\u201d Ly said when asked what drew her to the part. \u201cBut it\u2019s so much more than that. I feel connected to Maria.\u201d ADVERTISEMENT No, Ly isn\u2019t a nun who has fallen in love with the father of the children she cares for as Maria does in the musical. What she relates to in the show is the theme of immigration, of parents willing to leave their homeland in search of a better life for their family. The show opens Tuesday night at Minnesota State University Moorhead. Though Ly was born and raised in West Fargo, her parents left Vietnam after the war to find more opportunities for themselves and their family. \u201cTheir journey was one of sacrifice and resilience and a pursuit of hope. I feel connected to her story,\u201d Ly said of Maria. Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein\u2019s classic 1959 musical focuses on Maria, a young nun in 1938 Austria questioning whether the cloistered life is right for her. She is sent to care for the children of the widowed Captain von Trapp and teaches them the joys of singing songs like \u201cDo-Re-Mi\u201d and \u201cSo Long, Farewell.\u201d As she starts to have feelings for Capt. von Trapp, the Germans annex Austria. Maria and the family are forced to choose whether they will fall in line with the Nazis or stand up against the authoritarian power. ADVERTISEMENT \u201cLeaving a culture you know to stand up for what\u2019s right and stand up for your values \u2014 it allows me to hone in on my family history,\u201d Ly said. \u201cUnfortunately, it\u2019s still timely as a large portion of the show is about standing up to a regime they don\u2019t believe in,\u201d director Craig Ellingson said, talking about why ActUp, a troupe with a mission of producing shows that deal with social justice and health issues, chose the piece. There\u2019s also the fact that the music is not just recognizable, but catchy. \u201cIt\u2019s infectious,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s one of those chestnuts of American musical theater.\u201d Although she relates to the story personally, Ly doesn\u2019t bring her family\u2019s history to the stage and instead the show stays true to the original musical. \u201cThis story is about the von Trapps for me,\u201d the North Dakota State University graduate said. While she grew up hearing the music, she didn\u2019t really know the show too well before auditioning. Though she\u2019s never been in musical theater, she has some experience singing on stage with the Fargo-Moorhead Opera. ADVERTISEMENT With so many classic tunes in the show, she\u2019s reluctant to pick one as a favorite, but she\u2019s particularly fond of \u201cThe Lonely Goatherd.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s spirited and uplifting and kind of embodies Maria. She\u2019s whimsical and warm and those are the qualities that make her so charming,\u201d Ly said. \u201cPlaying Maria is being the best version of myself. The authenticity she leads with makes her so compelling. She reminds us of the joys one can take from the simple things in life.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s summer theater, we want them to feel a sense of escapism, but there\u2019s a reason this show is still around and being performed,\u201d Ellingson said. \u201cIt\u2019s very easy to not stand up and be complicit in silence. By not standing up or speaking up, you\u2019re making a choice, you\u2019re making a statement.\u201d While Ly\u2019s goal is to put on an engaging and entertaining show, she wants guests to leave with more than a song in mind. \u201cThe music and sentiment give it an accessibility, but the historical context gives (the show) weight. Behind the songs and the scenery, the story has real stakes,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a journey that so many families go through these days.\u201d **If you go** What:\u201cThe Sound of Music\u201d When:7:30 p.m., Tuesday through Saturday ADVERTISEMENT Where:Gaede Stage, MSUM Info:Tickets are $30,actuptheatre.org ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT AccountManage My AccountPrivacy PolicyTerms and ConditionsPolicies and StandardsSubscriber Benefits Manage My Account Privacy Policy Terms and Conditions Policies and Standards Subscriber Benefits Manage My Account Privacy Policy Terms and Conditions Policies and Standards Subscriber Benefits NewsSubscription OptionsEmail NewslettersE-PaperOur News Network Subscription Options Email Newsletters E-Paper Our News Network Subscription Options Email Newsletters E-Paper Our News Network ContactGet HelpContact UsAdvertise With UsGet Our Advertising NewsletterCareers Get Help Contact Us Advertise With Us Get Our Advertising Newsletter Careers Get Help Contact Us Advertise With Us Get Our Advertising Newsletter Careers MoreJobsHQClassifiedsPublic Notices JobsHQ Classifieds Public Notices JobsHQ Classifieds Public Notices Twitter Instagram Facebook"}
