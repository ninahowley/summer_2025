By Ivo Vegter* The first flight of 49 supposedly persecuted Afrikaners who landed in the United States this week were given a royal welcome. Let\u2019s play a little game, shall we? Here are nine photographs of refugees. Which is the odd one out? The photos represent Rohingya refugees in Malaysia (Free Malaysia Today); Central American refugees on the border with Texas (UNHCR); Kosovar refugees fleeing Kosovo (UNHCR); refugees from the DRC entering Uganda (Wikimedia); South African refugees on their way to the United States (source unknown); Syrian refugees in Budapest, Hungary (Wikimedia); Syrian and Iraqi refugees sinking off the Greek coast (Wikimedia); Afghan refugees in Pakistan (UNCHA); and Kosovar refugees arriving at a Red Cross camp in North Macedonia (Pascal Parrot/Sygma). What is different about the picture in the middle? Being a refugee is awful. It is scary. Refugees typically flee with nothing but the clothes on their back. They\u2019re hungry, tired, and often traumatised. Their present is insecure, and their future is uncertain. What refugees are not, is smiling happy people, like the people in the centre photo. They spend weeks, months or even years in camps with minimal services, limited hygiene, and no privacy. They are dependent on overstretched international NGOs and charities for basic shelter, food and medical needs. They struggle to get low-level bureaucrats and border guards to accept their bona fides as humanitarian refugees or asylum seekers. Do the Afrikaner \u201crefugees\u201d in that middle picture look hungry, tired and traumatised? No, because they just won the immigration lottery, and are f\u00eated all the way to a safe and secure destination. Visiting royalty They didn\u2019t have to brave the seas in dodgy, overcrowded boats. They got a charter flight. They didn\u2019t have to argue with border security. They were processed in three weeks flat before they even left. They weren\u2019t interned in a camp in inhumane conditions, with families split up and children separated from their parents. They werepersonally welcomedby the Deputy Secretary of State, Christopher Landau, and Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security, Troy Edgar. They were given the personal information of these two senior officials, should they want for anything. They were treated like visiting royalty, which is why they\u2019re grinning their heads off and waving cute little American flags. This is a public relations exercise.

The economy is bad, the politics divisive, the unemployment rate is high, and most importantly, the crime rate is terrifying. It is true that employment equity and other race-based redress laws can make it hard to earn a living for some white South Africans. Many are forced to start their own businesses because the odds of finding employment are low. It is true that living in rural South Africa is scary. For that matter, so is living anywhere else, but when you\u2019re an hour\u2019s drive from the nearest police station, and a long way from the nearest neighbour, the isolation heightens the danger. Do I blame these 49 people for being opportunistic and taking up America\u2019s offer of refugee status for Afrikaners? Absolutely not. A chance to relocate, for free, to the richest large country in the world doesn\u2019t come along every day. Do I think they\u2019re cowards, as President Cyril Ramaphosa has said? Absolutely not. And it is pretty offensive for a billionaire president with full-time VIP protection to call ordinary South Africans cowardly for fleeing crime. But do I think these Afrikaners merit refugee status? Absolutely not. Refugee status If these people merit refugee status, then millions of South Africans merit refugee status, whether they\u2019re Afrikaners or not. One of the supposed refugees sat fora lengthy interviewwith retired US Army colonel Chris Wyatt, who has taken a special interest in Africa. He identified her as \u201cAthea van Straaten\u201d. She claims to have survived four farm attacks, and I have no reason to doubt her account. I strongly sympathise and wouldn\u2019t for a minute seek to minimise the seriousness of farm attacks. I can certainly understand her desire to flee South Africa. However, the notion that her case is unique, or that she is being targeted because of the colour of her skin, is highly questionable. **Victimhood** I have been the victim of assault three times, myself. Once, I was tied up at knifepoint in my own house, before being cleaned out. Once, a drug addict attacked me from behind on the street. I needed stiches in my head and was on crutches for three months. Once, a drunk guy the size of a rugby prop assaulted me and kicked the living daylights out of me while I was on the ground. All of these cases, plus a few more burglaries, a laptop theft, and two car thefts, were reported to the police. None of the perpetrators were ever caught. For what it\u2019s worth, the racial breakdown of my attackers in the three assault cases were black, coloured, and white, respectively. Several people I knew personally have been murdered in South Africa. Many more, of all races, have been burgled, hijacked, raped, defrauded, or viciously assaulted. I\u2019m a refugee of sorts myself, having fled crime (and traffic) in Johannesburg for the relative safety of a small town in the Western Cape. When political agitators want to \u201cslit the throat of whiteness\u201d, or announce, \u201cwhites are thieves and there won\u2019t be peace\u201d, they\u2019re referring to me as much as they refer to any Afrikaner or farmer. Am I as much of a victim as Ms Van Straaten? It is a meaningless comparison. Do I think of myself as a victim, or think I merit refugee status in the US? Absolutely not. Read more: By Trump\u2019s criteria, every single white person in South Africa ought to qualify for refugee status, along with every single coloured and Indian person. Black South Africans outside the ruling elite would qualify on all counts other than racial discrimination laws. In short, the admission as refugees of only white Afrikaners is entirely arbitrary. **Mistaken claims** Theexecutive orderthat led to the strange sight of happy Afrikaners en route to the land of plenty was based on some sorely mistaken claims. \u201cIn shocking disregard of its citizens\u2019 rights, the Republic of South Africa (South Africa) recently enacted Expropriation Act 13 of 2024 (Act), to enable the government of South Africa to seize ethnic minority Afrikaners\u2019 agricultural property without compensation,\u201d it said. That is incorrect. The Act enables the government to seizeanyone\u2019s propertywithout compensation. It is not limited to agricultural land, nor to land in general. It could confiscate cars, computers, machinery, and books. It is not limited to ethnic minority Afrikaners, but can be invoked against anyone, regardless of their ethnic or racial identity. \u201cThis Act follows countless government policies designed to dismantle equal opportunity in employment, education, and business, and hateful rhetoric and government actions fueling disproportionate violence against racially disfavored landowners.\u201d Again, that is incorrect. The policies are designed torestoreequal opportunity in employment, education, and business. (Whether they do so, and whether they are justified, is a separate issue.) Hateful rhetoric happens, but that is mostly limited to the fringes of politics and is hardly unique to South Africa. That there is disproportionate violence against racially disfavoured landowners is also false. According to the Transvaal Landbou Unie (TLU SA),as quoted byAFP, Farm murders peaked at 119 in 2002, and have steadily decreased to 32 in 2024. That\u2019s 32 too many, but that\u2019s hardly \u201cdisproportionate violence\u201d. The executive order undertakes that \u201cthe United States shall promote the resettlement of Afrikaner refugees escaping government-sponsored race-based discrimination, including racially discriminatory property confiscation\u201d. Yes, there is race-based discrimination, and I (like the IRR) have been arguing that such redress measures ought to be retired for nigh on 20 years, but there has not been any \u201cracially discriminatory property confiscation\u201d. Not a single one of the 49 \u201crefugees\u201d has had their property confiscated without compensation. As far as I know, the newly amended Expropriation Act (objectionable though it is) has never been used in practice. **White genocide** The South African Police Service does not provide racially classified victim statistics, but it is highly likely that black people, both men and women, are far more likely to be victims of violence than relatively well-off (and consequently well-defended) white Afrikaners. US President, Donald Trump, and his MAGA enablers have long repeated \u201cwhite genocide\u201d talking points that are either wildly exaggerated or outright falsehoods. Back in 2018, whenTrump first raised this issue, the IRR\u2019s Terrence Corrigan wrote anexcellent analysisthat concluded: \u201cBoth the white genocide narrative, and those who set it up as a straw man are doing no favours to the society they claim to care about.\u201d Genocide Watch has a \u201cwatch\u201d alert status on South Africa, but puts the country at the \u201cpolarisation\u201d stage, which is a long way short of actual genocide. If polarisation was the criterion, one would have to conclude that left-wing professors, the LGBT+ community, immigrants, and Christian Nationalist right-wingers are all under imminent threat of genocide in the US. **Assimilation** Both of the Deputy Secretaries who welcomed the Afrikaners to the US spoke in vague and often mistaken terms about the hardships the new arrivals allegedly endured in South Africa. When asked why the Trump administration was welcoming Afrikaner refugees, while it blocked the entry of all other refugees into the US, both Landau and Edgar said that among the criteria for admission were \u201cmaking sure that refugees did not pose any challenge to our national security and that they could be assimilated easily into our country\u201d. Trump has declared a national emergency in order to bypass statutory law obliging the US to process the asylum applications of all other refugees. WatchChris Murphy, the ranking member of the US Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security, excoriating the Secretary of Homeland Security over a department \u201cout of control\u201d that violates both the Constitution and the rule of law. Admitting only white Afrikaners because they can be \u201cassimilated easily\u201d is a clear dog-whistle to the far right. Along with the \u201cwhite genocide\u201d talking points, it plays right into white nationalist rhetoric about the socio-economic stresses caused by \u201cdiversity\u201d. **Great replacement** It also aligns with the \u201cgreat replacement theory\u201d, which argues that dark-skinned people from Muslim-majority countries are moving to \u201cwhite\u201d and \u201cChristian\u201d countries like the US with the objective of replacing the native (largely white and Christian) population. For clarity, immigrants comprised 14.3% of the US population in 2023, which is below peaks of nearer 15% in 1870, 1890, and 1910. Most of those immigrants are Catholic Christians from Central America. That Trump denounces South Africa\u2019s government for racism may be true, but coming from him it is blatantly hypocritical. See if he admits any non-white refugees from South Africa\u2019s stagnant economy, crumbling infrastructure, failing public services, endemic crime and violence, and world-record unemployment rate. There are real refugees, from regions far more dangerous than South Africa, that are being denied entry into the US. Some of them fought alongside American soldiers in its foreign campaigns. That the Trump administration ignores them, in favour of white Afrikaners, smacks of racism. Perhaps they deserve each other. I wish the happy Afrikaner refugees the best of luck. I hear a lot of vacancies for farm workers, janitors, and domestic cleaners have opened up since the mass deportations of insufficiently white immigrants began. *Ivo Vegteris a freelance journalist, columnist and speaker who loves debunking myths and misconceptions, and addresses topics from the perspective of individual liberty and free markets.
