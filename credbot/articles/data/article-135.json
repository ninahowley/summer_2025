Or what states and Congress actually do when these orders are announced? Now BillTrack50 gives journalists and advocates an innovative way to see how federal executive orders reverberate through the legislative process. Denver, CO\u2013 LegiNation, Inc., creator of the BillTrack50 platform, has launched its groundbreaking Executive Order Tool, allowing users to track how presidential executive orders translate into actual legislation across states and Congress. This first-of-its-kind tool helps journalists, advocates, and citizens monitor how states and Congress respond to presidential executive orders through legislation. \u201cThe question we asked ourselves was, \u2018How are states and the federal government itself reacting to the EOs written by the President?'\u201d says Karen Suhaka, founder and president of LegiNation, Inc. \u201cWhile President Trump\u2019s executive orders have drawn attention, the historical record still belongs to Woodrow Wilson, who issued 1,803. Trump has signed 129 so far \u2014 and at this pace, he could catch up. We wanted to create a tool that would reveal the ripple effects of all of these executive orders throughout the legislative ecosystem.\u201d For example, for President Trump\u2019s January 2025 Executive Order 14151 on DEI programs, the tool identifies a slew of states incorporating the EO\u2019s intent into their legislation \u2013 like TN HB0923 \u2013 while others are pushing back \u2013 like NJ Bill S4242, which establishes an Office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion in each State department or agency. Users can easily filter executive orders by keyword, review details, and discover potentially related bills with just a few clicks. The complete tool is available for free as part of BillTrack50\u2019s commitment to democratic transparency. \u201cDemocracy works best when citizens understand what\u2019s happening,\u201d Suhaka adds. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019ve made this powerful tool completely free for everyone \u2013 journalists, advocates, and concerned citizens alike. It\u2019s all part of our mission to make democracy more democratic.\u201d How It Works:The Executive Order Tool is simple to navigate. BillTrack50 users select \u201cEXECUTIVE ORDERS\u201d from the left navigation menu to view a comprehensive list of all presidential executive orders along with a plain English AI-generated summary of each order. Or anyone, even without a BillTrack50 account, can access the tool at this link:https://www.billtrack50.com/executive-order/list. After reviewing an order of interest, users can click the \u201cSIMILAR BILLS\u201d button, and the tool will identify connections between executive orders and subsequent bills, scoring relevance through BillTrack50\u2019s AI engine. Each match receives a relevance score based on textual and contextual similarity, helping users quickly identify the most significant connections. BillTrack50 users can then add the bills to a saved search for tracking and sharing purposes. Suhaka notes, \u201cEOs are not bills, so there is a certain amount of interpretation that has to take place with regard to similarity. We see this tool as part of a collaboration with citizens; our role is gathering this information for groups like journalists and advocates to help them interpret and gain an understanding of the landscape, which enables them to take the next steps of action.\u201d For more information about the Executive Search Tool, contact: Jim Nowakowski, 847-358-6884,jim@interlinegroup.com, or Karen Suhaka directly at 303.809.2046 eMail:Karen@LegiNation.com. # # # About LegiNation, Inc.Based in Denver CO, LegiNation, Inc. was founded with the goal of making state and federal legislation more readily available to the professionals who need it, and even more importantly to the public at large.
