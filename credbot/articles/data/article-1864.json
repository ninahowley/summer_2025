Karen Price, the Director of Institutional Assessment at Western Carolina University, told AIM\u2019s investigator, in terms of DEI, they \u201care still absolutely doing all of that work;\u201d however, in order to keep it under the radar in the \u201ccurrent political climate,\u201d there is no one person in the role of Chief Diversity Officer. DEI, however, is spread out throughout the school and \u201cbeing repurposed through other positions so that we can do the work,\u201d she said. \u201cLike honestly, it\u2019s more we\u2019re trying to embed that kind of Diversity, Equity, Inclusiveness, Inclusive Excellence, really across, like, every area should have responsibility for that,\u201d she said. \u201cLike, it shouldn\u2019t just be like an office or a figurehead.\u201d When AIM\u2019s investigator said, \u201cAnd if you embed it, then it can\u2019t be legislated out,\u201d Price enthusiastically agreed. \u201cThere you go!\u201d she said. \u201cNow you\u2019re, now you\u2019re understanding the strategy behind what it is.\u201d \u201cIt is easier for them to be like, well, you need to get rid of that position because it has that niche title,\u201d she explained. \u201cWell, if we don\u2019t create titles, and that it\u2019s more just the work you do, and it\u2019s part of everything that should be centered on just being, living your mission\u2026 That you\u2019re right, you can\u2019t legislate it away. You can\u2019t take away positions.\u201d Price told AIM\u2019s investigator how positions and money have been dispersed to evade the DEI ban, while continuing to do DEI-related work.\u201cI think if you saw the news, there are some places that did lose a lot of positions because they were more, less strategic, I guess, about the approach,\u201d she said. \u201cSo we were able to take, in fact, take the monies that were there and more disperse them down to action level.\u201d \u201cSo, the work is still occurring very much here at Western. You just might see it called different things,\u201d Price summarized. \u201cI don\u2019t even mind pissing people off,\u201d Price said. \u201cBut I think what it comes down to, though, is just making sure that we\u2019re able to do the work.\u201d When Accuracy in Media tried to ask Western Carolina University staffers what they thought about DEI work being spread out, dispersed, and embedded throughout the university, they did not have a response. Watch the full video on YouTube here. Price admitted that DEI work is still being done at Western Carolina University under different names, throughout the school, in order to circumvent the Board of Governors\u2019 ban. At theUniversity of North Carolina at Charlotteand theUniversity of North Carolina at Asheville, AIM also found administrators bragging about evading the DEI ban. The administratorswere removed from their positions, but that does not mean radical administrators have stopped plotting throughout the UNC system. Go toSaveNCSchools.comto tell the Board of Governors that administrators should not be discussing how to \u201cembed\u201d DEI throughout the school, using different names in order to bypass the ban. **YOUR SUPPORT WILL HOLD THE MEDIA ACCOUNTABLE.** Accuracy in Media is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit using citizen activism and undercover journalism to expose corruption, law-breaking, and public policy failures.
