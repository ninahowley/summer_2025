Eating carbs is delicious and convenient, but too many can cause fat deposits around the waistline and make you feel sluggish. What most people don\u2019t realize is that the \u201covereating\u201d of carbs might not be their biggest problem \u2014proper digestion of carbsis what most people are actually lacking. There\u2019s one specific type of enzyme we need to break down carbs, but it\u2019s not always the easiest to get, depending on what your diet is like, of course. **Carb Digestion in the Human Body** While simple carbs like fruit are the fastest-digesting ones, starches and breads are different. Carbohydrate digestion begins when these foods are chewed in the mouth and ends with elimination from the colon. Between these first and last steps, carbs are first broken down by thesaliva secreted from your salivary glands,which moistens the food as it\u2019s chewed. This saliva contains digestive enzymes to help the body process carbohydrates, includingamylase, the enzyme responsible for breaking down carbs. Once the digested food reaches the pancreas,it releases pancreatic amylase to break down carbs into dextrin and maltose, which are finally made into glycogen to be stored in the liver. **Amylase \u2014 The Enzyme That Breaks Down Carbohydrates** Enzymes like amylase are needed for proper digestion according naturopathic doctor Josh Axe, but most people don\u2019t get enough. As a result their saliva lacks the proper enzymes to break down carbs, and everything from dental problems to gas, digestive problems and more can happen. \u201cWithout proper levels of amylase and other digestive enzymes, it really is impossible to have your health be at its best,\u201d Dr. Axesaid on his website. He recommends supplementation with amylase for people who don\u2019t have enough stored within their bodies. Enzymes are held in a bank account of sorts, and when the account starts running low, you need to add more \u201cdeposits\u201d to make your digestion work properly. \u201cAt this point (the conclusion of the carbohydrate breakdown process), if you don\u2019t have a deficit of digestive enzymes, then most of the work is done,\u201d Axe said. \u201cHowever, for many people, digestive enzyme supplementation is needed and helps this whole process take place as it should.\u201d **Top Food Sources of Amylase** There are several different food sources of amylase as well. Many of the top sources come from the brassica (cruciferous) vegetable family, including the following: Beets Celery Cauliflower Onions Turnips Other sources of amylase include: All cereal grasses except barley (contains alpha amylase, which breaks down random locations on the \u201cchain\u201d like structure of starches and carbohydrates) Corn (make sure yours is not GMO) Oats Rice Sweet potato (contains beta amylase, which breaks down the ends of the carbohydrate starch chain, including the large polysaccharide structures within the molecules) A molecular model of amylase. Photo via Laguna Design \u201cEnzymes play a key role in every function in the human body,\u201d Dr. Axe said. \u201cThese protein-based substances are involved in breathing, eating, digestion, kidney and liver function, reproduction and more.\u201d **Where to Find Digestive Enzyme Supplements** Digestive enzyme supplements aren\u2019t especially popular yet among most everyday health food store companies, as items likeelderberry,vitamin C, vitamin D and zinc (justifiably so) have been among the most widely purchased during the COVID-19 situation. But these supplements are becoming increasingly popular among people who want to support their overall health, and their ability to digest their favorite foods like pizza, pasta, bread and other carbohydrates, in a natural and holistic-minded way. Digestive enzymes are typically taken with large meals as a supplement to help your body digest carbs, proteins, and fats more efficiently. This helps prevent bloating, post-meal fatigue, and may even help prevent weight gain in people whose digestion needs an assist. I am a big fan ofthis protein and digestive enzyme supplement from Touchstone Essentials, whichcontains five different enzymes (including Amylase)to help your body break down everything including fats and carbohydrates. ******* Big Sale Happening Now At Paleo Valley!
