(KTVZ) -- Central Oregon's largest hospital for wildlife is encouraging hunters to change to non-lead ammunition, as they've treated over85 animals for poisoningsin the past 4 years, almost all of which passed away from the illness. But the cost, availability, and accuracy of the bullets are major hurdles for hunters. Sally Compton, the executive director for Think Wild, says most poisonings come from eating the carcass of an animal killed by lead ammunition. \"As it permeates through their system, gets to their brain, gets to their internal organs, that's when they start to really feel those symptoms,\" she said. When lead ammunition enters an animal, it usually splinters, sometimes up to 12 feet. When it does this, it infects the animal's carcass with lead, which can sometimes lead to these poisonings. During a visit to Think Wild, the Problem Solvers observed a routine test for the United State's official bird, the bald eagle, whose recovering from lead poisoning. The results brought good news, but for most animals, this isn't the case. \"Usually, they pass away,\" Compton told the Problem Solvers. Of the 85 animals brought to Think Wild for lead poisoning over the years, three of them have been bald eagles. Almost all died from the illness. So why would hunters use lead? Nathan Wismer,who owns a wood and steel company, says lead bullets are more lethal and make for a better shot. He said last time he went hunting he was able to bag a deer with just one shot. Kenneth Brown, who foundedLiberation Firearms training in Redmond, agrees, \"At the end of the day, you're just going to get a better shot. It's going to travel more consistently,\" Brown told the Problem Solvers. The other reason... dollars and cents. Brown, who buys and sells ammunition regularly, says non-lead ammunition is always more expensive, sometimes costing up to 50% more. The Problem Solvers went to his gun range, where non-lead ammunition is used, so customers aren\u2019t exposed to lead fragments. It's similar to why Think Wild says lead bullets can contaminate carcasses. \"Lead is going to be harmful to the body. You know it just is. Non-leads not,\" Brown said, \"You're inside of a shooting platform, inside of the bay, and I don't want you to have a bunch of lead all over the place\". So what's the solution to getting more hunters to make the switch? Most seemed to agree: getting that cost down, and raising awareness. \"Hunters are typically one of the greatest conservationists, like hunters love fish and wildlife,\" Compton said. \"So I think the more that we can educate and make accessible opportunities for not using lead, the better.\" Wismer, who hunts once a year, said, \"If it became more affordable and you could buy them in bulk, yeah, I have no problem with it.\" There is a group out of the Oregon Zoo called theNorth American Non-Lead Partnership. Theyraise awareness and educate hunters on the issue, but bringing down the cost is still a major hurdle States like New York have created incentives for non-lead ammunition, which is something Think Wild would like to see in Oregon. The Federal Fish and Wildlife Service also briefly had an incentive program. The Problem Solvers have reached out to our federal representatives to see what, if anything, they may support.
