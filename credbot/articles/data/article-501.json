The stealing of resources, often food gathered by another, is perhaps best known in birds and mammals, but is even more common and widespread in arthropods like ants, bees, flies and spiders. Spiders are involved in myriad kleptoparasitic interactions, best studied as obligatory kleptoparasites of other spiders. However, less attention has been paid to the critical role of spiders as \u201csuperhosts\u201d to commensal and kleptoparasitic organisms, and their variety of facultative kleptoparasitic strategies. To understand obligatory kleptoparasitism in spiders, it is first necessary to examine their role and characteristics as hosts and as facultative kleptoparasites. Most spider kleptoparasites utilize other spiders as hosts, a link that is not coincidental, and facultative resource stealing, in its many forms, is generally assumed to provide an evolutionary bridge to obligate kleptoparasitism. Here, I provide a brief review of these two roles through a summary of literature on all kleptoparasitic spiders and over 200 hosts. The phylogenetic distribution of spider hosts is distinctly non-random, involving about 200 species, in 86 genera, and 23 families. These then pertain to a few select lineages, out of total spider diversity: 23/136 families, 86/4,427 genera, and 200/52,765 known species. The vast majority of argyrodine hosts belong to four Araneoidea families (Araneidae, Nephilidae, Theridiidae, Linyphiidae), while the majority of hosts of mysmenid kleptoparasites are mygalomorphs, mostly Dipluridae and Ischnothelidae. Key spider hosts likeNephila,Trichonephila,Argiope,Cyrtophora, andLinothele, build large, often structurally complex, and persistent webs. Three-dimensionality, often in the form of auxiliary webbing, provides safe refuges for kleptoparasites, and the abundant prey and extended prey handling time of large spiders provide resources and opportunities for theft. Many of the favored hosts either interlink webs or are social. Key host traits to counter kleptoparasitism include web takedown and relocation, food concealment, and direct aggression. Facultative resource stealing in spiders includes web takeover, male kleptoparasitism of females in webs, and opportunistic prey theft. Among these, kleptotany, the facultative abandonment of own web and the invasion of a larger host web, to steal it and/or to prey on the host (araneophagy) are the most likely to link to obligatory kleptoparasitism. **1 Introduction** **1.1 Kleptoparasitism and kleptoparasite hosts** Kleptoparasitism is typically characterized by resource theft that comes at a cost to the host (Vollrath, 1987;Elgar, 1993;Iyengar, 2008). Scrounging may refer to individuals benefiting from food remnants left or ignored by the host, without direct conflict or the overt act of stealing valuable resources. Such behavior can occur in a social context and be tolerated or even cooperative. Yet, the apparent distinction between scrounging and kleptoparasitism is blurred, e.g. by the dynamic nature of many such foraging systems where the potential cost to the host ranges from negative to none (Trager et al., 2010,Figure 1) to potentially positive (Peng et al., 2013). When resources are limited the value of food items increases so that any theft may come at some cost. The same species may interact in environments, or during seasons, where resources are abundant, and resource theft may occur less aggressively and have negligible impact on the host\u00b4s energy budget. I emphasize kleptoparasitic systems wheretheft of extrinsic resources results inpotentialcost to the host. As pointed out byCoyle et al. (1991)while direct cost can be small and difficult to measure, even a single interruption where an invader distracts a host momentarily from feeding represents a potential cost to the host. As such, kleptoparasitism is usefully delimited from other forms of species-interactions that center on exploitation of innate properties of individuals (such as parasitism and predation) or involve intimate association of species that may be aggressive (competition over non-secured resources), or where species cohabit with neither player incurring even potential cost from overlapping resource use (commensalism, mutualism). The primary goal here is to set the stage for understanding the origin and evolution of obligatory kleptoparasitism and the ecological context that may render this strategy successful in the long term as anevolutionarily stable strategy. Pivotal to this endeavor is to examine facultative kleptoparasitism as a strategy that is often presumed to precede\u2014or be transitional to\u2014the evolution of obligatory kleptoparasitism. It is also critical to understand the nature of hosts, whose relatively close relationships to kleptoparasites in numerous organisms (Wheeler, 1901;Iyengar, 2008) are not coincidental, but integral to the success of the strategy (a generalized form of Emery\u00b4s rule,Emery 1909). Figure 1. The cost of resource theft to the \u00b4host\u00b4 varies dramatically across systems and can be challenging to estimate. Top: when hosts and kleptoparasites are comparable in size, the cost is high. Hyenas form packs that can sometimes steal prey captured by lions. The cost to the host is obvious and significant: a lion will risk fighting over the prey with potentially harmful consequences and may lose prey that is challenging to capture. Bottom: When kleptoparasites are tiny compared to the host their impact may be marginal. Left: a tiny argyrodine spider with the toweringTrichonephilahost in the background that as adults are over 100x its mass. Lower right: kleptoparasitic milichiid flies soak up some digestive fluids from the prey of a crab spider. The individual consumption of these small kleptoparasites has negligible impact on the host but collectively, over time, and in circumstances of low food availability, they still have thepotentialto reduce the host\u2019s fitness. Top, artwork modeled on a wirestock photo, lower left by I. Agnarsson, lower right by Jay Taylor. For kleptoparasites, resource theft may conserve energy that would otherwise be spent in foraging while simultaneously avoiding exposure to potentially hazardous prey or predators (Vollrath, 1987;Elgar, 1993;Iyengar, 2008). From the perspectives of the host, the cost of kleptoparasitism ranges from sublethal/lethal to minimal, even putatively positive, temporarily, and under certain circumstances. The potential cost and the long-term interaction of kleptoparasite and host, regardless, is expected to result in an arms race and the evolution of adaptive traits in the host to respond to kleptoparasite selection pressures. **1.2 The scope of this review** I initially envisioned this invited review as an opportunity for a comparative synthesis of kleptobiosis across the tree of life\u2014through the eyes of spiders. During months of effort, I gradually started to appreciate the gargantuan size and challenge of such a task. On the one hand, inordinately vast literature must be surveyed that offers a great wealth of information on different taxa and strategies. On the other hand, despite its volume, the literature is incredibly sparse on the most pertinent data needed for such meta-analyses, namely phylogenetic context. As for most lineages, this information is also largely lacking for spiders (but seeSu and Smith, 2014). I therefore shifted my focus to a synthesis of kleptoparasitism involving spiders, but this too turned out to be elusive. Spiders are involved in a great variety of kleptoparasitic interactions both as hosts to a great variety of kleptoparasitic lineages, as well as containing many species involved both in facultative as well as obligatory kleptoparasitism (Table 1;Supplementary Table S1). The scope of this paper is therefore focused on providing a platform for understanding obligatory kleptoparasitism through a review of spiders as hosts to kleptoparasitic groups, including facultatively kleptoparasitic spiders. I highlight some of the ways in which spiders are unique and important hosts for multiple lineages of kleptoparasites, defensive host strategies, and the variety of opportunistic kleptoparasitism seen across the order. Facultative kleptoparasitism is probably extremely widespread in spiders, with scattered records that I attempt to summarize. Araneophagy through web invasion is seen in several lineages, perhaps best known in salticids likePortia. Such behavior has been reviewed before (e.g.Jackson, 1986) and does not seem to be explicitly linked to kleptoparasitism in general, with the possible exception of the argyrodine theridiids where both traits occur. Therefore, I offer a brief overview to summarize the variety of web invasion behaviors in spiders, with emphasis on those that may be linked to the origin and evolution of kleptoparasitism. Table 1. Known hosts among spiders (seeSupplementary Table S1for detail). Are there emerging shared patterns in the evolutionary \u2018pathways\u2019 to obligate kleptoparasitism across the countless independent evolutionary origins of kleptoparasitism? This question is challenging to answer and to do so properly, requires phylogenetic comparative meta-analyses that will not be attempted here and may be as yet unachievable given scattered phylogenetic knowledge of the various lineages. An obvious and often cited hypothesis is that obligatory kleptoparasitism has transitioned from facultative kleptoparasitism (Iyengar, 2008;Breed et al., 2012). Such a route where opportunistic resource theft as a part of a broader foraging strategy can act as an evolutionary bridge to obligate kleptoparasitism is intuitively appealing. Candidate examples may come fromKoptothripsthrips initially utilizing damaged galls then moving to actively usurping intact galls (Crespi and Abbot, 1999),Lestrimellitastingless bees gradually losing pollen-gathering structures to become reliant solely on stolen food (Breed et al., 2012), sphaerocerid flies that range from facultatively stealing food from scavengers like dung beetles to specialized reliance on host (Sirvinski et al., 1999), andRanzoviusbugs that belong to a lineage containing many facultative kleptoparasites but where some species have become entirely reliant on their social spider hosts to capture prey (Henry, 1984;Wheeler and McCaffrey, 1984). In other cases, like spiders, such a transition between facultative and obligate kleptoparasitism is not obvious given the evidence at hand. Another hypothesis that may be specific to spiders suggests an evolutionary link between stealing from or predating on a host, though the direction of such transition is debated, and in fact, this link has not been clearly established (but seeSu and Smith, 2014, and below). Kleptoparasitism exemplifies the complex interplay between ecological opportunity, behavioral flexibility, and evolutionary adaptation. This versatile strategy has evolved independently across diverse taxa implying important ecological function and fitness consequences favored by natural selection. Below I provide the groundwork necessary to further our understanding of obligatory kleptoparasitism in spiders. **2 Spider superhosts: webs provide refuge and resources** **2.1 Spider webs as habitats** Spider webs vary greatly in their size and web tenacity (Eberhard, 2020). Larger and more permanent webs may form habitats for a variety of arthropods, including other spiders (Figure 2). Webs provide a stable environment rich in resources such as shelter, prey remnants, and protection from environmental extremes (Eberhard, 2020), attracting a range of organisms that engage in complex interactions with their spider hosts.Proctor (1992), for example, discussed the co-inhabitants in colonialCyrtophora moluccensiswebs in Moorea, French Polynesia. In fiveCyrtophoracolonies she found five additional spider species whose combined abundance far outnumbered the host spiders. These included web builders usingCyrtophorawebs as support, as well as the kleptoparasiticArgyrodes argentatusand the likely araneophagicPlatnickina adamsoni. Social spider webs form an even more diverse habitat, for example the webs ofAnelosimus studiosuscan contain numerous other spiders, and a range of other arthropods (Deyrup et al., 2004;Perkins et al., 2007;Mock, 2008), andJani et al. (2023)reported 21 spider species and many other arthropods and even vertebrates making the webs of socialStegodyphus sarasinorumtheir home. Further, in a survey of about 80 nests of subsocialAnelosimusin Madagascar Magn\u00fasson and Agnarsson (unpublished) found over 130 arthropod species associated with these nests. Figure 2. Spider webs are hosts for a variety of kleptoparasites. Here, aTrichonephilafemale sits at the hub of her web, feeding on prey. On her and the prey (inset lower left) kleptoparasitic flies share her prey. A wasp (left) and a hummingbird (right) may steal prey, and the latter also silk for its nest, from her web. Various obligatory kleptoparasite species (inset above and lower right) are constant guests in her web, gleaning insects, and prey packages, feeding with her, or on her juveniles. On the left side of the web, a hole has been cut out by a kleptoparasite, removing prey from the web.Artwork is a conceptual reproduction of figure 97 inVollrath (1987). The inhabitants of spider webs are varied. Some species, including certain beetles and lepidopteran larvae, act as scavengers, consuming waste materials and leftover prey within the web. InPhryganoporus candidusnests, scavengers like mealybugs thrive, benefitting from the sheltered environment and sometimes aiding in nest sanitation by breaking down waste\u200b (Downes, 1995). Some insects and spiders simply seek shelter in the nests of social spiders, while ants, wasps, assassin bugs, and other predatory insects have been documented as significant predators, sometimes killing spiders and stealing egg masses. Predatory wasps, for example\u2014while not kleptoparasitic\u2014invade host webs and have a major impact onMetepeira incrassatacolonies (Uetz et al., 2002). As discussed below, in addition to opportunistic predators, many types of kleptoparasites are also attracted to this community thriving in a prey capturing abode. **2.2 Ecology and biogeography of spider webs as islands** Spider webs function as fascinating examples of \u201chabitat islands\u201d, uniquely structured and highly distinct and quantifiable ecosystems (Blackledge and Gillespie, 2002;Blackledge et al., 2011) that support various forms of life, notably among them, kleptoparasitic spiders (Elgar, 1989;Agnarsson, 2003). Spider webs resemble islands in the isolation of habitat, patchily dispersed within a matrix of strikingly contrasting habitats (Agnarsson, 2011). Therefore, general ecological models used for island biogeography and metapopulation biology (MacArthur and Wilson, 1967;Hanski, 1997) are applicable to spider webs as habitats. For kleptoparasites, host webs like those of golden orbweavers (Nephila,Trichonephila), are attractive due to their size, tenacity, and predictable provision of essential resources (Elgar, 1989;Grostal and Walter, 1999). Similarly, due to the size and ease of discovery and measurement, webs of golden orbweavers are a convenient system to study ecology, such as how kleptoparasites are distributed among \u2018islands.\u2019 Studies on nephilids (Robinson et al., 1973;Elgar, 1989;Grostal and Walter, 1997,1999,Agnarsson, 2003,2011), and other types of host webs (Cangialosi, 1990a,b,Rypstra and Binford, 1995) have clearly established that web size is the best predictor of kleptoparasite load (Su et al., 2021).Fernandez-Fournier and Avil\u00e9s (2018)also showed that kleptoparasite diversity increases with web size across four different solitary and social host species, andMcCrate and Uetz (2010)showed that the number of Argyrodinae kleptoparasite species increases with size of colonies made up byMetepeira incrassataand associated web builders. This is expected as large webs both contain more silk, and thus areas to occupy, and intercept more prey resulting in a relatively high-quality kleptoparasite habitat (Gregori\u010d et al., 2021,2024). What is intriguing is the scalability of the system\u2014how abundance scales precisely with size (Agnarsson, 2011;Gregori\u010d et al., 2024), down to some \u00b4minimum\u00b4 size where kleptoparasites are generally absent (Agnarsson, 2002;Miyashita, 2002;Whitehouse et al., 2002). Thus, total host web area in a given region or habitat can approximately predict the expected number of spider kleptoparasites. Another interesting result from these studies is that a) while web clustering and interconnectedness\u2014a common feature of many nephilid species\u2014facilitate immigration and stabilization of kleptoparasite populations (Agnarsson, 2003,2011), b) even highly isolated webs have kleptoparasite abundances proportional to their size (Gregori\u010d et al., 2024). This suggests that habitat quality trumps connectivity when individuals freely distribute according to resources and implies that isolation is not limiting in the distribution of kleptoparasites. Spider kleptoparasites therefore seemboth adept at locating host webs and highly mobile. Accordingly, it has been shown that the distribution of kleptoparasites among host webs closely follows the Ideal Free Distribution model, where the free movement of individuals leads to an equilibrium in habitat occupancy in relation to suitability (Elgar, 1989;Agnarsson, 2003,2011,Gregori\u010d et al., 2024). The ability of kleptoparasitic spiders to detect and evaluate habitat islands suggests the use of airborne cues, likely pheromones produced by the host (Agnarsson et al., 2025), to locate suitable patches. In conclusion, spider webs provide a compelling model for studying habitat islands and the ecological relationships they support. Through examining the relationship between orb weavers and their kleptoparasitic guests, we can gain a deeper understanding of how patch quality and connectivity shape community dynamics in isolated habitats (Agnarsson, 2011;Gregori\u010d et al., 2024). The preference of kleptoparasitic spiders for larger webs, coupled with their impressive dispersal capabilities, demonstrates that for organisms in isolated ecosystems, the availability and quality of resources are paramount. Habitat islands, whether they are spider webs or isolated forest patches, illustrate the complex interactions between organisms and their environments, offering valuable insights into abundance distributions and resilience of ecological communities. **2.3 Web building spiders as ideal hosts for kleptoparasites** Spider webs provide a diverse habitat for a variety of organisms (Figures 2,3and text above) that alone makes them attractive to other foragers. The efficacy of these prey catching devices further renders them a predictable source of insect cadavers and the sedentary nature of web-building spiders creates a stationary and accessible resource for kleptoparasites (Vollrath, 1987;Eberhard, 2020).Vollrath (1984)suggests that web spiders are vulnerable to kleptoparasitism because they cannot run away or hide food. Web building spiders, furthermore, may capture both large prey that require extended handling times and more prey than they can consume at a given time, requiring storage within the web (Champion de Crespigny et al., 2001). Additionally, spiders lack mandibles and generally do not chew on prey but rather inject venom and digestive enzymes into the prey. The prey is thus partially digested externally and spiders feed exclusively by sucking up the digestive juices (Foelix, 1982). Combined, the prolonged prey handling, availability of predigested stored prey in the web, and slow absorption of food from the prey by the host, all represent excellent opportunities for kleptoparasitic organisms to join in feeding with the host or steal its wrapped prey items (Table 1;Supplementary Table S1). In addition, while spider webs are not well characterized as sieves (Eberhard, 2020) their design, even if well-tuned to capture \u00b4optimal\u00b4 prey, inevitably results in the by-catch of some very small insects that may not be important food source for the host. This presents an additional opportunity for kleptoparasites that are typically many times smaller than the host spider (regardless of developmental stage of either) or for whom such prey items represent valuable resources. It is no wonder then, that individual webs or colonies attract a great diversity of kleptoparasites, ranging from birds, large hymenopterans and scorpionflies, to tiny ants and \u00b4freeloader\u00b4 flies, in addition to the specialized spider kleptoparasites likeArgyrodes(Thornhill, 1975;Nyffler and Benz, 1980;Vollrath, 1987;Henschel, 1998;Sivinski et al., 1999). Figure 3.

Spiders are potentially dangerous hosts, but large spiders may pay limited attention to smaller organisms in their webs, if they are not struggling or sending other similar vibratory signals to the web owner (Vollrath 1979b,1987). While large spider webs thus attract a number of kleptoparasite species from diverse arthropod groups, the most numerous and speciose kleptoparasites in spider webs are other spiders. As pointed out byVollrath (1987p. 277) \u00b4[t]he spider web is a very special structure in terms of material, configuration and information transmission. It is not surprising that web spiders are the most successful inquilines in spider webs (Brignoli, 1966), since they are superbly preadapted.\u2019 In other words, spiders know how to operate spider webs and spider kleptoparasites can move about in webs stealthily and without becoming stuck on the sticky capture spiral of many of the hosts. Non-spider kleptoparasites that inhabit spider webs are, in fact, most common in webs that do not contain sticky silk, particularly in the webs of subsocial and social spiders that tend to show more tolerance toward other web inhabitants, many of which are, of course, their kin. Kleptoparasites may impose significant costs on spider hosts. While some scavengers may only consume leftover prey, kleptoparasites often remove entire prey items, reducing the spider\u2019s available resources (Henschel and Lubin, 1992;Vollrath, 1987). In some cases, kleptoparasites like ants or certainArgyrodesspecies also attack spider broods or egg sacs, increasing their impact on spider populations (Schneider and Lubin, 1997;Agnarsson, 2002). The persistent threat of kleptoparasites and predators has led to the evolution of several adaptive responses in spiders. Spiders likeStegodyphus lineatusexhibit defensive behaviors to reduce the risk of ant raids, such as altering web structure or abandoning heavily invaded areas (Henschel, 1998;Rypstra, 1981). Hosts may also relocate webs when kleptoparasitic pressure becomes unsustainable (Rypstra, 1981;Whitehouse, 1997a) offering short term respite from kleptoparasite activities (Robinson et al., 1973). In sum, while spiders are potentially dangerous hosts as major arthropod predators that have evolved various means of countering kleptoparasitism, spider webs offer many advantages making them an ideal host to other organisms, among which kleptoparasites are typically most abundant. **2.4 Characteristics and phylogenetic distribution of spider hosts** Even a cursorial look at the distribution of kleptoparasitic hosts across the spider phylogeny reveals a starkly non-random pattern (Figures 4\u20136). The inset figure on the left side shows in broad strokes that hosts are not spread proportionately across all spider diversity. A total of about 200 hosts have been recorded, including approximately 200 named species, 88 genera, and 23 families, a tiny fraction of spider diversity (Figures 5,6). But even among these, the distribution of the most critical hosts\u2014those home to the majority of kleptoparasites\u2014is non-random. Rather, as depicted inFigure 4, preferred kleptoparasite hosts, labeled in bold and green font, are concentrated in relatively few genera within a small subset of web-building spiders. These key hosts exhibit unique characteristics\u2014large, often structurally complex, and persistent webs\u2014that make them particularly suitable for kleptoparasitic exploitation (Exline, 1945b;Vollrath, 1984,1987,Elgar, 1993;Whitehouse et al., 2002;Whitehouse, 2011). Kleptoparasitic hosts are disproportionately found among large sheet or funnel web spiders like web building mygalomorphs (Dipluridae, Ischnothelidae) and RTA clade spiders (Agelenidae, Pisauridae, Psechridae, Tengellidae), and among orbweavers (especially Nephilidae andCyrtophora, but also in large Araneidae, Theridiidae, and Linyphiidae). Within these families, key genera likeDiplura,Linothele,Ischnothele,Agelena,Psechrus,Nephila,Trichonephila,Argiope,Cyrtophora,Latrodectus,Linyphiaand a few other araneoids emerge as primary hosts for kleptoparasites, through sharing some key traits. All buildlarge webs, in absolute terms and certainly relative to confamiliars, that arelong lasting, either in being in constant construction and repair (mygalomorphs, RTAs,Cyrtophora,Latrodectus,Linyphia), undergoing only partial reconstruction (Nephilidae), or webs that are reconstructed with high site fidelity (Argiope,Gasteracantha). Most of these webs are3-dimensionalin primary architecture, or throughauxiliary webbingin the form of voluminous non-capture areas, either elaborate retreats where the host gets protected rest, or \u00b4barrier\u00b4 webs that may serve to slow down prey or as protection against flying predators and parasitoids. The auxiliary webbing in these non-capture areas provides an excellent refuge for kleptoparasites where they can stay in contact with the prey capture web, but outside the prey monitoring zone of the host. In most cases, preferred hosts are alsolarge spidersat least relative to the kleptoparasites. It is easier for a small kleptoparasite to go about unnoticed in a large host web, and some of the prey that gets stuck in large webs is so small as to be ignored by the host but represents an important meal for the kleptoparasite. Large prey items caught by large spiders may requirelong prey handling times, and excess capture results inprey storing, both of which provide additional opportunities for kleptoparasites (Champion de Crespigny et al., 2001). Finally, the most important host species tend to buildclustered websthat may even be interconnected. For example,TrichonephilaandCyrtophoraare the two genera that are hosts to the greatest diversity and highest abundances of kleptoparasitic spiders (Table 1;Supplementary Table S1). Both construct expansive orb webs that epitomize the key traits of \u00b4good hosts\u00b4, though nevertheless, they are architecturally strikingly differentas orb webs.Trichonephilabuilds a huge \u00b4modified\u00b4 vertical orb (Kuntner et al. 2019) with extensive barrier webbing, especially as juveniles, whileCyrtophoraconstructs a horizontal modified \u00b4sheet like\u00b4 orb with extensive vertical network of dense threads that intercept the flight of insects (Figure 3). Both tend to build webs in close proximity to others, frequently forming interconnected web clusters that may span significant areas. Aggregated webs provide large \u201carenas\u201d where kleptoparasites may freely wander among multiple provisioning hosts, supplying rich prey capture opportunities and ample shelters. The large-scale composition of colonies inherently diffuses the host\u2019s vigilance, creating a spatial limitation in policing and guarding resources effectively across the colony \u200b (Vollrath, 1984;Elgar, 1993)\u200b. Clustered webs may also capture more prey, due for example to \u00b4richochet effects\u00b4 (Uetz, 1989). The ultimate spider aggregations are found insocial spidersconstructing large communal webs housing hundreds or thousands of individuals (Avil\u00e9s, 1997). It is no surprise then that social spiders complete the list of the most important host species for kleptoparasites (Vollrath, 1987;Cangialosi, 1990a,b,c;Straus and Avil\u00e9s, 2018,2023).StegodyphusandAnelosimus, in particular, contain many social species all of which host kleptoparasites that in some cases are specialists, likeArgyrodes ululansonAnelosimus eximius(Cangialosi, 1990a,b, \u2013,1991) andArchaeodictyna ulovainStegadyphuswebs (Griswold and Meikle, 1987).Faiditus subdolusalso appears to prefer communal webs, hitherto found only in the nests of socialTheridion nigroannulatum(Avil\u00e9s et al., 2006) and the colonialPhiloponella oweni(Smith Trail, 1980). Some particular traits of social spiders, in addition to web size, complexity, and permanence, are conducive to spider kleptoparasitism. Social spiders have generally reduced levels of aggression as\u2014unlike typical solitary spiders\u2014they must tolerate conspecifics sharing the web (Avil\u00e9s, 1997;Agnarsson, 2002;2004). Communal web-building and resource sharing also translates to reduced individual control over web sections and increased \u00b4noise\u00b4 levels in the web, making it harder to detect invaders who are apt at navigating silk. Perhaps as a consequence of decreased host detection, kleptoparasites in social webs tend to be closer in size to the host spiders than kleptoparasites in solitary webs. As outlined above, social spiders are also favored hosts among non-spider kleptoparasites. Figure 4. Phylogenetic distribution of major spider host species, obligate kleptoparasitic spiders, and theridiid araneophages. The inset figure highlights that both kleptoparasites and their hosts are clustered on certain branches unrelated to patterns of total species richness within the tree. This distribution indicates that while many spiders are web-builders, only a subset has evolved the necessary web traits to support kleptoparasitic lifestyles effectively (see alsoFigures 5,6). This narrow host range likely reflects the stringent requirements that kleptoparasites have for host web characteristics\u2014namely, webs that provide sustained resources, cover, and minimal interference from the host. It is notable, also, that kleptoparasitism is clustered within Theridiidae and symphytognathoids, even though multiple origins are implied. Hosts in bold appear to be the most important in terms of number and abundances of kleptoparasites in their webs. Species number (species#) indicates diversity of kleptoparasites (kl) and araneophages (ar). The phylogeny is an interpretive reconstruction of relationships within Theridiidae fromLiu et al. (2016), while broader fundamental structure is fromWheeler et al. (2017)andKulkarni et al. (2023). The putative placement of Nicodamidae and relationships within Araneoidea, especially the monophyly and interrelationships among \u00b4symphytognthoids\u00b4 reflect the stronger character set ofKulkarni et al. (2023).Gushangzaois tentatively placed among hadrotarsine theridiids, as proposed byLin et al. (2024). Figure 5. The number of kleptoparasite species associated with major spider clades. The majority of kleptoparasite species are associated with spiders building large and long lasting webs: primarily Entelegynae but also Mygalomorphae. In Entelegynae, araneoid spiders are hosts to the highest number of kleptoparasite species. The most prolific among those are the classical hosts in Nephilidae building large orbs with extensive barrier webs, along with the araneidCyrtophorabuilding complex horizontal sheets with extensive auxiliary webbing, and the social theridiids (Anelosimus) and eresids (Stegodyphus) (seeFigure 6for detail). Among mygalomorphs, the vast majority of kleptoparasites are found in two genera making large brushed sheets,LinotheleandIschnothele. Figure 6. The total number of kleptoparasite species that have been documented associated with different spider families (only the most important host families labeled, seeTable 1;Supplementary Table S1for detail). The non-random distribution of hosts among spiders is evident. The \u00b4superhosts\u00b4 belong to families representing a small portion of total spider diversity: Araneidae (6%), Theridiidae (5%), Nephilidae (0.1%), Dipluridae (0.3%), and Eresidae (0.2%). Thus, for example, about 25% of kleptoparasite species are associated with the tiny Nephilidae. Linyphiidae have about as many associated kleptoparasites as expected by their relative species diversity (9.4%), while most families, and the vast majority of spider genera and species have not been documented as hosts to kleptoparasites. Even within the key host families, a tiny fraction of the genera and species are important hosts, as highlighted by the number of kleptoparasites found documented from key genera in each of the major host families (gray subtext to family names). Indeed, the overwhelming majority of host records come from species making large, complex, and long lasting 3-dimensional webs\u20141) horizontal (Cyrtophora) or vertical (e.g.Trichonephila) orbs with extensive barrier webs, 2) expansive silk networks of social spiders (Anelosimus,Stegodyphus), 3) \u00b4irregular\u00b4 sheets with swaths of very numerous silk lines (brushed sheets) containing a distinct retreat tunnel (Linothele), and 4) horizontal sheet webs with extensive auxiliary webbing above (Orsonwelles). Note that, commonly, kleptoparasite species are found in the webs of more than one family, though most of the kleptoparasite species that chose Dipluridae hosts (most mysmenid kleptoparasites) are exclusive to them. While preferred spider hosts share many traits, the stark divide in host use between argyrodine and \u00b4symphytognathoid\u00b4 (Mysmenopsis,Isela,Curimagua) kleptoparasites is intriguing and suggests we have a very partial understanding of host choice. The mygalomorphsDipluraandLinotheleconstruct brushed sheet-like webs that span the ground or other surfaces and are key hosts for a clade of symphytognathoid kleptoparasites (excludingSofanapsis) but are rarely used by argyrodines. In turn, symphytognthoids are relatively rarely found in orb webs suspended above the ground that are favored by argyrodines. Thus, it seems that the even \u00b4good hosts\u00b4, as characterized above, building large, complex, and permanent webs, are not simply a free-for-all. Effective utilization of a given host type may require some adaptations. That two monophyletic lineages (argyrodines and mysmenids) have diverged to specialize on these different web types \u2014sticky orbs vs mechanical (non-sticky) sheet and funnel webs, respectively--begs adaptive questions. It remains to be seen if we can identify traits that differ between argyrodine and symphytognathoid kleptoparasites and may help explain this division in host use. Certainly, certain kleptoparasite behaviors may be orb-web specific like silk consumption (spiders have not been documented consuming aciniform silks, used in the sheet of Diplurid webs) and stealing wrapped prey items. However, in both cases kleptoparasites feed with the host, possibly the primitive foraging mode of spider kleptoparasites. Curiously, the other symphytonathoid kleptoparasite, the anapidSofanapis, is highly unusual in preferring host rarely used by the other two clades. It seems to prefer austrochilid hosts, while also found in the webs of Hahnidae, in addition to occurring in some classical orb webs. Regardless,Sofanapisdisplays the putatively primitive foraging mode of feeding with the host. Of identified species, the host to the highest number of kleptoparasite species is probably also the best studied, the AmericanTrichonephila clavipeswhere 21 species of mostly argyrodines have been documented (Table 1;Supplementary Table S1). While vastly less effort has been afforded to other nephilids as host, other species likeT. inaurata,T. clavata, andNephila pilipesare known to harbor multiple species of kleptoparasites (Table 1;Supplementary Table S1).Whitehouse et al. (2002)suggested a special importance of Nephilidae hosts globally, and field biologists certainly can confirm that large nephilid webs, as a rule, house multiple argyrodine individuals. In addition toNephilaandTrichonephila, largerNephilengysandNephilingiswebs are rarely without kleptoparasites, that may also be found inHerennia.Cyrtophora citricola, and otherCyrtophoraare similarly critical hosts harboring high abundances and numerouse species of kleptoparasites. These two groups seem to be the preferred hosts of the majority of argyrodine kleptoparasites, with some clear exceptions (Table 1;Supplementary Table S1), however, systematic research on kleptoparasite distributions and assembly into host webs is generally lacking. The tight link betweenLinothelemygalomorphs andMysumenopsiskleptoparasites has become particularly clear recently with the effort ofDup\u00e9rr\u00e9 and Tapia (2015,2020), but again, almost no research on host choice and assembly into host webs exists on mysmenid kleptoparasites. **2.5 Deferred hosts** In contrast to the groups discussed above, the majority of web building spiders rarely host kleptoparasites and thus appear to be deferred hosts\u2014that is their webs have much lower kleptoparasite loads than predicted based on web size. While many knowledge gaps exist and new research constantly adds to the list of kleptoparasitic species and their hosts, a \u00b4list\u00b4 of deferred hosts among web building spiders would be very long, approximately the inverse of hosts listed inTable 1(see alsoSupplementary Table S1). Even some found inTable 1, species thatare utilizedas hosts, are clearly deferred. For example spiders in the genusLeucaugeare among the most common orbweavers in many habitats (own obs.). Yet they rarely contain kleptoparasitic spiders. In fact, many of the records ofLeucaugeas a host come from a study whereMcCrate and Uetz (2010)failed to find kleptoparasites in its webs, unless in multi-species colonies of web-builders associated with the colonialMetepeira incrassata. In some areasLeucaugewebs are generally without kleptoparasites but may serve as interim hosts during seasons when preferred hosts are not available (Miyashita, 2002).Miyashita (2002)foundArgyrodes bonadeaandA. flavescensinLeucauge blandawebs in Japan but almost exclusively when preferred hosts (Nephila pilipesandTrichonephila clavata) were not in season. Regardless,Miyashita (2002p. 34) found thatL. blandahad \u201c\u2026significantly fewer [Argyrodes] \u2026 on their webs than expected from their web area\u201d.Tetragnathaand other tetragnathids, most Araneidae genera, and nearly all small \u2018\u2018orbicularians\u2019\u2019 (e.g.Cyclosa,Eustala,Mangoraetc.), are further examples of extremely common, diverse, and abundant orbweavers that rarely host kleptoparasites. Similarly, amaurobiids, most pholcids, mysmenids, and most theridiids, are examples of diverse web builders underutilized by kleptoparasites (Supplementary Table S2). In fact, the vast majority of species of web-building spiders are deferred hosts, likely including many entire families of spiders like Theridiosomatidae, Symphytognathidae, and other groups of small spiders. The vast majority of species in the most diverse web-building groups Linyphiidae and Theridiidae are also deferred. In the latter two, nevertheless, certain species rank among clearly preferred hosts. It is logically obvious that what characterizes deferred hosts is lacking some or most of the traits of preferred hosts. There are vastly more species of small rather than large web builders, which may more readily detect similar-sized invaders and compete more directly with them for food. The majority of orbweavers make small webs with little auxiliary webbing, renew webs daily, and may frequently relocate.Leucaugeare an exception in that their orbs are often associated with barrier webs, and indeed many kleptoparasites of many species have occasionally been found in their webs. However, these relatively small spiders are incredibly aggressive toward web intruders (Eberhard pers. comm.) which may explain whyLeucaugewebs seem mostly to be used as \u00b4last resort\u00b4 hosts when preferred hosts are absent. Smaller spiders and webs capture fewer insects, are likely to have faster prey handling time, and less reason to store prey. Most web builders, furthermore, do not form interconnected clusters. In some cases, a single trait may separate preferred from avoided hosts. Large orbweavers have many attributes that are attractive to kleptoparasites, yet only a portion of them commonly host them, likely due to lack of certain critical traits. A point in case can be made regardingGasteracanthaandMicrathena. The two genera are diverse and highly similar as large, spiny, brightly colored spiders that build big and highly regular symmetric orb webs, in relatively open areas. Numerous species of argyrodines have been documented in a number ofGasteracanthaspecies that, at least in certain habitats, appear to be among the most important hosts. In contrast, kleptoparasites are rarely encountered inMicrathenawebs (except when associated with multi-species coloniesMcCrate and Uetz, 2010). While both genera remove webs at night and rebuild during the day, a key difference may be in what they do not remove.Micrathenaremoves the entire web leaving at most one or two lines whileGasteracanthaleaves up a number of frame lines that that are reused as frames the following morning (Eberhard pers. comm.). Such minor differences may suffice to allow kleptoparasites to more easily find webs or web remains at night and stay associated with host webs that are taken down but rebuilt in the same spot. **2.6 Hosts from the perspective of kleptoparasites** It is clear that host choice is not random. First, only a small subset of web building spiders seem appropriate hosts. Second, even among spiders that build relatively large and permanent webs, kleptoparasite diversity and abundance is concentrated in the webs of a few host species. But how decisively do kleptoparasites chose among \u00b4acceptable hosts\u00b4? There is a range of opinion but limited data on kleptoparasite host specialization.Vollrath (1984p. 70), e.g. discussed argyrodines and claimed that \u00b4[o]f the 50-odd neotropicalArgyrodestwo are presently known to be specialists, about ten to be generalists\u2026\u00b4. Specialists are, he claims, in large araneids (Araneus,Cyrtophora,Argiope,Nephila), while generalists are found in multiple additional hosts (Vollrath, 1977). SinceVollrath (1984,1987) kleptoparasites are commonly referred to as either specialists or generalists in literature (e.g.Elgar, 1993;Whitehouse, 2011;Su and Smith, 2014). Yet the data at hand suggest a more subtle picture. In an extensive study of argyrodines (treated together under the genusConopisthaat the time) of Peru and Ecuador,Exline (1945bp. 506) stated \u00b4There is no correlation between the various species ofConopisthaand species of their hosts. They inhabit indifferently webs ofGasteracantha,Argiope,Meta, andAranea[=Araneus], in localities where these orb weavers occur.\u2019 Similarly, as more data are gathered, species that once were thought to be specialists, likeArgyrodes elevatus, have now been documented in a large sweep of hosts (Supplementary Table S2). On the other hand,Exline (1945bp. 506-507) discussed preferred and deferred hosts in general: \u2018Some field observations on the relationships ofConopisthato host species may be important if correctly interpreted. In most areas where the genus is common, species of orb-weavers, includingMeta,Gasteracantha,Aranea,Argiope,Tetragnatha,Cyclosa, andLeucauge, are common.Conopisthanearly always is present in the webs ofMeta,Gasteracantha,Aranea, andArgiope, but almost never in webs ofTetragnatha,CyclosaorLeucauge. Spiders of the first groups, hosts ofConopistha, feed upon large insects\u2014beetles, large flies, bees, and Orthoptera\u2014and disregard the small prey in their webs. Orb-weavers which do not harborConopisthafeed on such minute insects as small flies, mosquitoes, and midges.\u2019Exline (1945a,b)believed host choice was essentially random and that kleptoparasites survived and thrived when they happened to be in webs where they did not compete with the host for prey or fall prey to it. There is little evidence for host choice to be random, especially with respect to preferred and deferred webs in general. However, establishing true host specialization requires large amounts of data that simply do not exist for most species. Studies that have been made over a short period of time, in a particular region or season, or particular habitat, may find evidence suggesting specialization, while the strength of any proposed association with a particular host tends to break down as more data are added.Vollrath (1976,1977,1979b,1984), for example, suggested thatArgyrodes elevatusis a specialist on large hosts, principally found in webs ofTrichonephila clavipesandArgiope argentata, which is an expert in stealing food bundles from the hosts hub. Further studies on this species have found it utilizing a variety of host species, large and small. Thus, in stark contrast with Vollrath,Silveira and Japyass\u00fa (2012)instead considerA. elevatusto show extreme plasticity, employing diverse tactics to steal food from a great variety of hosts and web types. These includeNephilengys, variousArgiopeandAraneus, colonialMetepeira incrassataandCyclosa huila, subsocialAnelosimus baeza, as well as in solitary webs of theridiid spiders such asLatrodectus,Tidarren, andParasteatoda. What can we therefore claim about host specialization in argyrodine kleptoparasites? As proposed byAgnarsson et al. (2025)asking if one species is a specialist or a generalist is not a productive approach to understand the complex interplay between kleptoparasites and hosts. Rather \u201cargyrodines may better be characterized as kleptoparasites generally capable of discriminating among host webs, but that choose hosts with varying degrees of astuteness or concern.\u201d A more productive approach, therefore, will be to better assess kleptoparasite distribution and assembly into host webs at a community level, and the factors that impact host choice. In particular, what host traits do kleptoparasites cue in on and why do some species seem to choose hosts with greater astucity than others? **3 Diversity of organisms as kleptoparasites of spiders** **3.1 Non-spider kleptoparasites on spider hosts** A number of animals regularly exploit spider webs, ranging from commensals to kleptoparasites, to predators and parasitoids, depending on whether symbionts compete for the same resource and the manner of their foraging or reproductive strategy (Supplementary Table S3, Robinson and Robinson, 1977). Some arthropods may be purely commensal, such as mealybugs found inPhryganoporus candidusnests, or scavenging beetles that rummage leftover prey and waste (Downes, 1995), or lepidopteran larvae feeding mostly on plant material incorporated into the webs of social spiders. Kleptoparasites (Supplementary Table S3), in addition to other spiders, include species of hemipterans (Davis and Russell, 1969;Henry, 1984) panorpoid scorpionflies (Thornhill, 1975), lepidopteran larvae (Robinson, 1977), wasps (Jeanne, 1972), damselflies (Vollrath, 1977), numerous dipteran species of at least 10 families (Sivinski et al., 1999), rove beetles and other scavenging beetles, Cheyletidae mites, and other arthropods (Supplementary Table S1,Knab, 1915;Bristowe, 1931, 1941,Richards, 1953;Robinson and Robinson, 1977), and even birds, such as a hummingbird that steals both insect prey and silk (Young, 1971). Many of these are attracted to prey captured by the host spider or entangled in its web, others may be more generally predators in the host webs where they may prey on host or commensal spiders, their eggs or juveniles, or other arthropods in the web (Schneider and Lubin, 1997;Henschel, 1998). Ants, for example, enter webs and may steal prey from the web and/or prey on the host and its offspring (Schneider and Lubin, 1997;Henschel, 1998). Parasitoid wasps target host spiders, their eggs, or even other symbionts (Hieber and Uetz, 1990). Kleptoparasites that compete with spiders for prey, remove prey items secured by the spider, or feed with the host, clearly can negatively impact the hosts (Henschel and Lubin, 1992). Probably the majority of non-spider kleptoparasites in spider webs are facultative. Scorpionflies (Panorpidae) opportunistically enter webs to feed on captured prey (Thornhill, 1975). Other facultative kleptoparasites include damselflies (Zygoptera), apocritan wasps, and lepidopteran larvae that may occasionally steal prey from spider webs or use the web or webbing as nesting material (Jeanne, 1972,Robinson, 1977;Vollrath, 1977), and mites and beetles that scavenge on debris left by the host spider or consume parts of prey remains (Faust et al., 2012). Hummingbirds may occasionally use silk taken from spider webs as nesting material and grab prey items as they pass by (Young, 1971). The impact of facultative kleptoparasites can be difficult to evaluate. Secondary consumption on decomposing prey bodies or web-bound detritus, can be of no consequence to the host, or even beneficial if it results in effectively reducing waste within the web. Yet, all these taxa may remove resources with potential fitness consequences for the host spider. On the other end of the spectrum, there is clear evidence that facultative kleptoparasites can be very harmful to the host. Ants provide a stark example of harmful occasional kleptoparasites. When they wander into spider webs, they have the ability to recruit large raids of foragers that opportunistically steal resources and predate upon hosts (Schneider and Lubin, 1997;Henschel, 1998;H\u00f6lldobler and Wilson, 1998). As ants may continuously patrol a network of routes around their nests, they can pose a persistent and ominous challenge to web building spiders (Henschel, 1998;H\u00f6lldobler and Wilson, 1998). Furthermore, ants likeVeromessor pergandei,Oecophylla smaragdina, andAnoplolepis gracilipescan not only steal prey and forage on egg sacs but may also dismantle spider webs e.g. to salvage trapped nestmates. Many groups then rely mostly on kleptoparasitism, where spiders may be among their hosts, or their exclusive hosts. Dipterans are adept kleptoparasites often feeding on prey along with the predators, and numerous species in families including Milichiidae, Phoridae, Chloropidae, and others (Supplementary Table S3) approach or invade spider webs (Sivinski and Stowe, 1980;Sivinskii et al., 1999). Milichiid flies are chemically attracted to prey caught in spider webs and often hover near the web until an opportunity arises to feed undetected. The majority of such flies apparently go unnoticed, perhaps adapted to hovering at a safe distance and landing on the spider carapace or on the prey only when the spider is occupied. Or the host opts to not detract them, however, some percentage of these flies may themselves end up as prey.Ranzoviusbugs (Miridae) likeR. morensandR. contubernalisare specialist kleptoparasites scavenging prey items in spider webs, many associated with the socialAnelosimusspiders (Henry, 1984;Wheeler and McCaffrey, 1984;Guariso, 2000;Deyrup et al., 2004) In conclusion, spider webs represent not only snares for prey capture but also complex habitats that sustain diverse communities where kleptoparasitic organisms are the most diverse. From the stealthyArgyrodesto opportunistic ants, each kleptoparasitic organism has developed strategies to exploit spider webs to its advantage. Clearly, spider webs play ecological roles beyond prey capture, providing important microhabitats within most terrestrial ecosystems. **4 Facultative kleptoparasitism in spiders and araneophages in kleptoparasitic lineages** **4.1 Interactions among spider species in webs \u2013 webs as refuges and structural support, and web invasion** Spiders exhibit a fascinating array of web-invasive strategies exploiting the webs of other spiders in intra- and interspecific interactions including\u2014in addition to kleptoparasitism\u2014other resource usurpation, web takeover, predation, and mating. Perhaps the least invasive usurpation of spider webs is using a stranger\u2019s web as a refuge from predators, as seen in some wandering spiders in social spider webs or using the structural lines of the web to support one\u00b4s own web. Such connecting behavior characterizes colonial spiders that in addition to clustering around abundant resources may benefit from interconnectedness via \u00b4ricochet effects\u00b4 (Uetz, 1989), the ability to sense struggling prey in multiple webs, predator defense, and others (Rypstra, 1989). Colonial species such asMetepeira incrassata(McCrate and Uetz, 2010) andPhiloponella republicana(Binford and Rypstra, 1992), and those that more facultatively interlink webs likeCyrtophoraspp. (Rypstra, 1979;Leborgne et al., 1998) andTrichonephilaspp (Rypstra, 1981;Agnarsson, 2011), may also connect their nests to heterospecific webs. Many other species facultatively connect their webs to others, particularly to webs of colonial or clustering species.Leucauge,Uloborus,Micrathena,Holocnemus pulceiand some other pholcids, various small orbbweavers, linyphiids and theridiids are among those using \u00b4host\u00b4 webs as structural support (Bristowe 1941a,b,Eberhard et al., 1993;Leborgne et al., 1998;McCrate and Uetz, 2010, Magn\u00fasson and Agnarsson unpublished). As webs of inter- and intraspecific individuals are thus frequently contiguous (Krafft, 1970;Burgess and Uetz, 1982;Jackson and Hallas, 1986;H\u00e9naut et al., 2010), opportunities for web invasions abound. Indeed, spiders in interconnected complexes often enter neighboring webs to pursue insects (facultative kleptoparasitism,Supplementary Table S2), or opportunistically predate on the web owner (Kullmann, 1959a,b,1960;Jackson and Hallas, 1986;Wise, 2006).Bristowe (1941a,b), for example, observedPholcussp. predate on the owners of various webs it connected to, including araneids, theridiids, amaurobiids, agelenids and other pholcids. Other spiders instead of linking their web will invade webs to aggressively steal prey from the host, kill the host, or attempt to take the web over. The best-known cases are wandering spiders likeOlios(Sparassidae),SimaethaandPortia(Salticidae) that engage in aggressive facultative kleptoparasitism by removing the prey from their hosts (Jackson and Wilcox, 1990).Portiais unique in its versatility of foraging strategies, being among the very few jumping spiders that regularly build prey capture webs, in addition to hunting outside a web, and invading the webs of other species (Jackson and Hallas, 1986). It may or may not connect its own web to a host web and opportunistically forage kleptoparasitically or via araneophagy. Even though they will take insects,Portiaspecies are specialized araneophages that will prey on eggs, juveniles, and capture host spiders using a variety of tactics including stealth and mimicry (Jackson, 1985,1987,Jackson and Blest, 1982;Jackson and Hallas, 1986). Web building spiders may instead engage in web takeover. Kleptoteny refers to such theft were spiders abandon their own webs to invade and exploit the webs of others. While there are relatively few observations of web invasion by web building spiders (Enders, 1974;Buskirk, 1975;Eberhard et al., 1978;Wise, 1981,2006,Wickler and Seibt, 1988;Eichenberger et al., 2009;Houser et al., 2014;Gan et al., 2015;Gould, 2021), web building spiders frequently abandon webs when insufficient prey is captured (Turnbull, 1964), providing an impetus to wander off web and possibly happen upon other webs inadvertently. It seems likely that web takeover is widespread as an opportunistic strategy (Bilsing, 1920,Bristowe 1941a,b). Web building spiders web takeover may take place intra- or interspecifically, can be passive or aggressive, and involve various life stages, including adult males.Enders (1974), in an experimental setup, observed passive (empty web) conspecific web takeover inLarinioides cornutusandArgiope trifasciata. Both species would also invade empty webs of some other orbweavers andEustalasp. was observed taking over empty webs ofLarinioides cornutus(Bilsing, 1920;Enders, 1974). Aggressive web takeover has been seen in a number of species. ColonialCyrtophora citricolaadults and juveniles will displace each other depending on the capture rate of individual webs (Blanke, 1972;Eberhard et al., 1978;Rypstra, 1979) and adultTrichonephila clavipeswill displace smaller individuals from their webs (Farr, 1976;Christenson, 1984).Cyrtophora citricolaoften steal food from one another (Whitehouse and Lubin, 2005) and in some cases, rather than attempting to take over webs, some individuals may simply opt to be webless and operate as facultative kleptoparasites in conspecific webs. This has been observed, for example, inC. citricolaandAgelenopsis aperta(Rypstra, 1979;Christenson, 1984). It is unclear if such \u00b4intraspecific optional weblessness\u00b4 differs from other facultative kleptoparasite strategies.Gan et al. (2015)observed intra- and interspecific aggressive web takeover among various orbweaving species includingLariniaria argiopiformis,Neoscona inusta,N. punctigera,Parawixia dehaani,Zygiella x-notata, andTetragnatha laboriosa. Webs built higher in the vegetation and those capturing more prey were more likely to be invaded, and typically, as inC. citricolaandT. clavipes, the success rate of web takeover depends on the relative size of invader and host. Similarly,Eichenberger et al. (2009)observed interactions between the introduced linyphiidMermessus trilobatuswith native European sheetweb spiders (Erigone dentipalpis,E. atra,Gnathonarium dentatum,Dicymbium nigrumandMicrargus herbigradus). The impetus for the study was the indicated invasive takeover of webs by the introducedM. trilobatus, however,Eichenberger et al. (2009)found that all of these species may attempt web takeover. Like prior studies, they found that body size plays a critical role in the outcome of these interactions, whether intra- and interspecific web takeover. This kind of web takeover is a clear example of facultative kleptoparasitism (aggressive usurpation) where the stolen resource is not prey secured by the host, but its prey capturing device and, of course, the prey it subsequently entangles.Eberhard et al. (1978)observations of webs ofMetazygiaspp. in Colombia illustrate a form of web robbery in which male spiders seize webs from immature or conspecific individuals to capture prey. This is a particularly interesting case of size-based aggressive usurpation as the males themselves typically do not build webs. They observed a maleTetragnathasp. invade the web ofM. gregaliswhere it stole prey and eventually replaced the smaller owner in the hub of the web. Similarly, they saw males ofEustalasp. andLarinia directatake over webs ofMetazygiaand males ofMetazygiataking over webs of conspecifics or otherMetazygiaspecies. The males would then capture prey in the stolen web. Male spiders may also feed on silk, maleLeucauge marinamay steal silk from the webs of larger orbweavers (Eberhard, 2020). Observations on male behavior after they molt to adulthood and abandon web building, but prior to courtship, is generally lacking. However, it is reasonable to assume that males wandering in search of females will opportunistically capture prey on and off webs and steal other resources. The males of many species that cohabit with females they (attempt to) mate with, will take prey from the webs (see below), and web building spiders are certainly capable of capturing prey outside their webs,Gould (2021), for example observedTetragnathasp. haul up a large dragonfly without the use of a web. **4.2 Mating and males as facultative kleptoparasites** Webs typically serve as mating sites, with males abandoning their own webs and seeking to invade the web of a female to court her. It is common that males cohabit with females in their webs for some time, guarding a subadult female until she molts to maturity, defending her against other males, or awaiting an opportunity to sneak in and mate (Foelix, 2010). In the case of large spiders with pronounced sexual size dimorphism (female biased extreme sexual size dimorphism, eSSDsensuKuntner and Coddington, 2020) males may even accumulate in significant numbers in female webs. In communal species, likePhiloponellaspp (Opell, 1979), it is also common to find males in the colonies and it seems likely they take prey opportunistically. Though observations are sparse for this aspect of male biology, the scattered records suggest that males may commonly act as facultative kleptoparasites in female webs.Linyphia litigosamales steal prey from females they cohabit with and will even fight her for prey (Rovner, 1968;Wise, 1975;Watson, 1990). Many male pholcids will, similarly, aggressively pursue food in female webs (Eberhard and Brice\u00f1o, 1983,1985,Blanchong et al., 1995). Males in some species are favored to win fights due to larger size (Eberhard and Brice\u00f1o, 1983), or in species where the sexes are similarly sized, the larger individual tends to have the upper hand (Blanchong et al., 1995).Latrodectus revivensismales enter webs of females, even juveniles and subadults, and steal prey. The impact is particularly negative for younger females that may opt to relocate their webs to escape the male, at a high risk of mortality (Lubin et al., 1993). MaleStegodyphus lineatuscohabit with females and may steal and consume their eggs (if not their own) and steal prey from them, acting as costly kleptoparasites in female webs (Schneider and Lubin, 1996,1997). Facultative male kleptoparasitism is typically less aggressive and costly to females. MaleMetellina segmentatahang out at the edge of the female web and may enter the web when the female has captured prey and feed with her, both prior to and after mating (Blanke, 1974;Prenter et al., 1994;Elgar and Fahey, 1996). In the eSSD nephilids, where multiple males often cohabit with the giant female, their foraging behavior is quite similar to that of obligatory kleptoparasitic argyrodines.Trichonephila clavipesmales, for example, await their opportunity in the barrier web and enter the web to glean insects ignored by the female, feed with the female, eat silk, or may even steal prey from argyrodines inside the female web (Christenson and Goist, 1979;Vollrath, 1977;1980,1987). In bothNephilaandTrichonephilathe largest male may reside near the hub and feed with the female while the smaller \u00b4satellite\u00b4 males glean insects and rival argyrodine kleptoparasites (Robinson et al., 1973,1976, Kuntner pers. comm.). It is likely that males of other nephilids and of other eSSD orb weavers where males accumulate in female webs display similar kleptoparasitic behaviors (Robinson et al., 1973;Christenson and Goist, 1979;Vollrath, 1980, Kuntner pers. comm.). Male cohabitation may in some cases be more mutualistic than parasitic in nature. Males of the pholcidsBlechrocelissp. andModisimusspp. cohabit with female and capture prey in her web (Eberhard and Brice\u00f1o, 1983,1985). While the generally larger males will contest with the female over prey, the males appear to \u00b4concede\u00b4 the prey to females upon \u00b4begging\u00b4 gestures she makes, vibrating her abdomen. In some instances, males will capture and wrap prey, signal the female by plugging the web, and then leave the prey to her, or even carry the prey to her.Eberhard and Brice\u00f1o (1983,1985) suggest that this kind of \u00b4chivalry\u00b4 inBlechrocelisandModisimusspp. may render the interaction between males and females mutualistic. On the other hand, where the sexes are similarly sized like inHolocnemus pluchei, the outcome of a struggle for prey depends on individual size, males not being favored in general. On such \u00b4equal terms\u00b4 males that happened to secure a prey from a female, did not show any signs of \u00b4chivalry (Blanchong et al., 1995). Perhaps the lack of a general size advantage means that males cannot exert control over females by stealing prey at will and then secondarily offering it to them. **4.3 Facultative kleptoparasites and araneophages** In addition to web takeover scattered across multiple web building groups, and male facultative kleptoparasitism that is also widespread but rather poorly known, a few cases of facultative kleptoparasitism that involve neither web takeover nor male spiders are relatively well documented. Information on a few groups of such facultatively kleptoparasitic taxa are summarized below. In addition, some taxa specializing in araneophagy are treated below, although they may be similar to taxa discussed under section 5.1. These are examples taken to highlight groups likeRhomphaeaandAriamnesthat due to details of strategies and/or phylogenetic position, may display transitional traits related to the evolution of kleptoparasitism. Information on further facultative spider kleptoparasite and araneophages can be found above and inSupplementary Table S2, though it is far from exhaustive. It should be noted that not all spider kleptoparasites steal from other spiders.Henrikseniacrab spiders take food from pitcher plants (Fage, 1928;Striffler and Rembold, 2009;Chua and Lim, 2012), and spiders may also take food from other predators and scavengers (Cushing, 2012).Jackson and Pollard (2008), for example, observed three Kenyan species ofMenemerusjumping spiders snatch food from the mandibles ofCrematogasterandCamponotusants, a behavior first noted byBhattacharya (1936)in the IndianM. bivittatus[asM. melanognathus]. Near the shores of a lake masses of Chaoboridae and Chironomidae midges that had emerged from a lake were found perishing on the walls of buildings scouted by ants.Jackson and Pollard (2008)describe how the spiders would track ants as they walked by and attack if they were carrying prey. The spiders would approach rapidly, grab the fly with their chelicerae and pull away as the ant let go of the prey. Only relatively small individuals would partake in prey theft, which complemented typical prey catching by these jumping spiders. Hence, the kleptoparasitic behavior is facultative andJackson and Pollard (2008)suggest that it may secure fly prey more rapidly than stalking the fly directly. Further, as the flies are dead or dying, the spiders may use the ants as assessors picking out among the cadavers prey that is still palatable. This foraging tactic has been noted in multipleMenemerusspecies, but is not a common salticid behavior, suggesting this may be an adaptive, although facultative, strategy. In most cases, spiders steal food from other spiders, and typically on the host\u00b4s web.Oonopsis a fairly large genus of Oonopidae spiders containing one species known to be kleptoparasitic.Oonops pulcheris a small spider that has been observed in a variety of habitats, hunting on the ground as typical for oonopids, sometimes found in birds\u2019 nests, but also in the webs of larger spiders (Bristowe, 1930,1958).Bristowe (1930)observedO. pulchermove among the retreat strands of its hosts, ignored by the host agelenid or amaurobiid spider, feeding on remnants of the hosts meals.Oonops pulcheris clearly a facultative kleptoparasite, most commonly found outside a host webs (Le Peru, 2011). Platnickinais a theridiid genus containing 12 species some of which have been observed invading other spider webs.Platnickinais an anomaly in this summary of genera as it likely rarely steals prey. It is discussed here to highlight the need for further studies of the genus, and to consider the potential links between opportunistic web invasion and obligatory kleptoparasitism in spiders.Platnickinaspecies build their own web, a simple network of threads, and commonly capture prey there (Suzuki et al., 2022). The majority of prey consists of insects like nematoceran flies and paraneopterans, but some 40% of the prey were spiders.Platnickinawill wander outside its web and into webs of hosts including other theridiids,TetragnathaandTrichonephila(Bristowe 1941a,b;Namkung, 2003;Suzuki et al., 2022). There, it will attempt to attack and kill the host but has a much lower success rate in killing hosts in the host\u00b4s web than in capturing prey in its own web. The large size of potential spider host prey may make up for the challenge in capturing and killing it.Platnickinamay be an opportunistic kleptoparasite as well, Suzuki (pers. comm.), for example, has observedP. sterninotanafeeding on a largeBrachycerafly in a theridiid web. Rhomphaeacontains 37 argyrodine species that are primarily thought to be araneophages and are often discussed in the context of the origin of web invasion and kleptoparasitism.Rhomphaeaspecies are typically elongated, with long \u00b4tails\u00b4 that they can move in a worm-like fashion (Archer, 1946)\u2014their bodies appear well camouflaged, especially within host webs. WhileRhomphaeaspecies are often found in their own simple web consisting of several irregularly spaced threads, they are also frequent invaders in the webs of other spiders. \u00b4Hosts\u00b4 ofRhomphaeainclude a variety of smaller sheet (Linyphiidae) and cobweb (Theridiidae) spiders\u2014including social theridiids\u2014as well as orbweavers (Archer, 1946;Exline and Levi, 1962;Smith Trail, 1980;Whitehouse, 1987b;Guarisco, 2000;Kim and Kim, 2007;McCrate and Uetz, 2010;Srinivasulu et al., 2013). In most cases,Rhomphaeaare reported as host predators, but they have also been observed stealing food from host webs (Eberhard, 1979;Yaginuma, 1986,Yoshida, 2001a,b).Suzuki et al. (2022)found that the diet of adultRhomphaeaconsists mostly of spiders, with some 15% of predation attempts directed at insects, while juvenileRhomphaeacapture mostly insects.Rhomphaeahad a high predation success on its own simple thread webs (95%), but in host webs it often fails to capture the host spider (25% success rate), especially when the host is large. It is likely thatRhomphaeaventures into host webs in an attempt to catch larger prey than it gets on its own web, even if less successful. Ariamnesis an extraordinary genus of argyrodine theridiids, containing 24 species with exceptionally elongated and worm-like abdomens (Vollrath, 1977).Ariamnesare relatively large spiders, and unlike most members of the subfamily, they appear to rarely wander into webs of other spiders (Clyne, 1979;Eberhard, 1979).Eberhard (1979)describes the web ofAriamnesas a sparse, irregular, three-dimensional network of long, non-sticky threads that can extend up to 1-2 meters. Rather than functioning as a snare, this web serves as a resting site for the spider and as a base for ambush attacks. Juveniles ofA. attenuatusprimarily capture nematocerous flies that tend to hang on these threads, while adults capture juvenile spiders, typically non-web builders larger than themselves. They use a specialized predatory technique shared withRhomphaea, throwing sticky silk with their hind legs to immobilize prey.Suzuki et al. (2022)found that spiders constitute about 75% of the prey ofAriamnes, with a preference for cursorial spiders over web builders, and including other araneophagic spiders likeRhomphaea,Platnickina, and even otherAriamnes.Ariamnesforaging behavior appears to be quite homogenous across species. The spider\u2019s resting posture, with legs outstretched, may be a camouflage resembling a pine needle caught in the web.D\u00f6nitz (1887)described the spider\u2019s unique egg sac, a bell-shaped structure suspended by threads and resembling an elongated cocoon with a wool-like interior, which the adult females guard (Eberhard, 1979). Spiders employ diverse web invasion tactics, utilizing webs for predation, resource competition, shelter, and mating. Diverse groups of both web builders and web-less hunters enter webs in search of resources or mating opportunities. Facultative kleptoparasitism is found in most such species, opportunistically stealing prey, silk, or even the web itself, regardless of the ultimate objective ranging from courtship to cannibalism. Facultative kleptoparasitism is also found in some spiders stealing prey not from a web spider. For reasons outlined in the Introduction, I have not attempted to exhaustively review facultative kleptoparasitism in spiders. It is a compelling but underexamined facet of spider biology, marked by dynamic and often intricate interactions: overt contests for webs, covert theft of prey and silk by males wandering in search of females, sexual conflict on display in facultative male kleptoparasitism, opportunistic resource theft by versatile taxa, and specialized araneophagy. Opportunities for innovative future research abound\u2014given the phylogenetic spread of observed species, and the somewhat haphazard nature of such observations. I predict thatfacultative kleptoparasitism is far more widespread and common than currently appreciated.Spiders that engage in opportunistic web invasions demonstrate an evolutionary flexibility, using webs of others to reduce the energetic costs of web building and prey capture. If as pervasive as hypothesized above, the occurrence of web invasions and facultative kleptoparasitism across diverse spider lineages may imply that the evolutionary bridge to obligatory kleptoparasitism in spiders is rather short. **4.4 Obligate spider kleptoparasites** In total there are probably between 200-300 species of obligate kleptoparasites among the ~53,000 spider species currently known (WSC, 2025). Some behavioral or habitat data (host webs) are available for a little over 100 species (seeTable 1;Supplementary Table S1and References, summarized in Agnarsson in prep.), while the majority of species expected to be kleptoparasitic lack such data. Many new species also doubtless await discovery and description (Agnarsson et al., 2013) as evidenced by a proliferation in descriptions of species and genera in recent years (Dup\u00e9rr\u00e9 and Tapia, 2020;Lin et al., 2024;Vanuytven et al., 2024). A synthesis on obligate kleptoparasitic spiders will be provided elsewhere (Agnarsson in prep.). **5 Host response to kleptoparasitism** The cost of kleptoparasitism is challenging to measure. In some cases, it is expected to be relatively small, when kleptoparasites only remove prey remains, prey ignored by the host, or silk. However, any removal of calories from the web has the potential to impact the host (Coyle et al., 1991;Whitehouse, 2011) and even calories contained in ignored prey and silk represent a cost as these could be ingested by the host when recycling the web. In many cases, kleptoparasitism inflicts a more readily measurable costs on host spiders, especially through prey depletion and its cascading effects on growth, reproductive output, and fitness (Vollrath, 1987;Elgar, 1993;Whitehouse, 2011). Studies onAnelosimus eximiusdemonstrate thatFaiditus ululansmay consume up to a quarter of the prey in a host\u2019s web (Cangialosi, 1990b), and research onTrichonephila clavipesshows that the daily caloric requirements of argyrodine spiders can reach at least 20% of that of the host when kleptoparasite abundances are high\u2014in this case when they reach about 40 per web (Vollrath, 1980;Elgar, 1993). While these may be extreme examples, even at a smaller cost, kleptoparasites divert significant energy reserves away from the host spider\u2019s reproductive efforts and thus fitness. It is obvious that such resource diversion can be particularly damaging in energy-constrained environments, where each prey item represents a critical contribution to the host\u2019s metabolic requirements. In social webs, the impact of kleptoparasites can amplify, as these webs represent a \u201cpublic good\u201d shared among colony members. The shared prey resources attract kleptoparasites who consume prey captured collectively, placing additional strain on the colony (Straus and Avil\u00e9s, 2018,2023). Thus, this resource-sharing model, though beneficial for maintaining the colony, becomes a point of vulnerability, making communal webs especially susceptible to kleptoparasitic exploitation and resource depletion (Leborgne et al., 2011). This highlights the ecological cost of maintaining large, accessible prey traps in communal settings \u200b (Vollrath, 1984), where kleptoparasitism can reach \u00b4sublethal\u00b4 levels (Straus and Avil\u00e9s, 2023). The behavior and phylogenetic distribution of kleptoparasitic hosts suggests an evolutionary trade-off, perhaps even an arms race between web-building spiders and kleptoparasites. Hosts in clades like Nephilidae, Araneidae, and Dipluridae have evolved \u00b4progressively\u00b4 (or repeatedly) larger and more intricate webs presumably under fecundity selection where larger females require ever more food to produce more offspring (see e.g.Kuntner et al., 2019;Kuntner and Coddington, 2020). However, large and elaborate webs with high prey capture success rate also attract kleptoparasites. This trade-off may have at least two consequences. First, one expects increased selective pressure on direct hosts countermeasures such as means of detecting and eliminating kleptoparasites while maintaining such webs. Second, the majority of orb weaving spiders take down their webs and rebuild daily. It is tempting to consider the possibility that daily web recycling, in addition to providing a fresh capture surface daily, is an example of a trade-off where the costs of kleptoparasitism outweigh the benefits of more elaborate permanent webs. However, testing this hypothesis may be challenging, and if orb recycling evolved once, as the evidence may suggest (e.g.Eberhard, 2020and references therein), putative causative factors will ever remain speculative. One observation casts doubt on such co-evolutionary scenario; spider kleptoparasitism likely evolved later (and mostly within Araneoidea), than daily web recycling in orb-weavers. Thus, the origin of web recycling does not relate to (at least extant) spider kleptoparasites. The hypothesis is still tenable given the negative impact of heavy kleptoparasite load (Vollrath, 1987;Elgar, 1993), and facultative web takedown and relocation by spiders suffering such heavy loads. It is plausible that kleptoparasitism maintains natural selection for web recycling, and that it plays a trade-off role in the evolution of large and permanent webs.Nephila pilipes(Robinson et al., 1973) for example will take down and relocate its web when kleptoparasite load is high. A new web location may offer a respite from kleptoparasites for up to 48 hours. Web relocation in socialAnelosimusand extreme \u00b4boom and bust\u00b4 population growth in socialTheridion nigroannulatumare both putatively linked to argyrodine kleptoparasites (Avil\u00e9s et al., 2006;Straus and Avil\u00e9s, 2018,2023). Thus, kleptoparasite pressure can become a resource drain leading to colony fragmentation or collapse. These scenarios underscore the likely evolutionary arms race between resource conservation strategies and kleptoparasitic exploitation, with host spiders displaying adaptive flexibility in web structure, prey management, and interspecific interactions to mitigate the fitness impacts of kleptoparasitism\u200b (Whitehouse, 2011). Certain solitary orb-weavers display a degree of tolerance toward minor kleptoparasitic activity, conserving energy by ignoring low-level incursions.Vollrath (1987)suggests that this tolerance may serve as an adaptive strategy, where active defense is reserved for more resource-intensive interactions. When implemented, hosts may engage in defensive behaviors aimed at excluding or confronting kleptoparasites.Trichonephila clavipes, for example, may respond to argyrodines with aggressive web shaking, or even pursuits. Many other host spiders have aggressive response to spider kleptoparasites that differs distinctly from their response to prey or predators (Vollrath, 1987). Further, the web itself may serve as a barrier modulating kleptoparasitic impact, e.g. through spatial separation of prey from potential kleptoparasites. For instance, layered retreats withinAnelosimuscolonies can limit direct access to prey-rich areas, creating a physical deterrent. It is likely that other traits, speed of prey capture and handling, retreats, and sensory biology are influenced by kleptoparasitism, but research is lacking on this front. **6 Conclusions** Certain spiders function as superhosts by providing structurally complex, resource-rich webs that support a wide range of kleptoparasites. Key superhost traits include large host and web size, high prey capture rates, web or website persistence, and three-dimensional auxiliary silk structures that offer refuges for kleptoparasites. These characteristics are most pronounced in genera such as the orbweavingNephila,TrichonephilaandCyrtophora, and sheet weaving mygalomorphs likeDipluraandLinothele. The webs of these hosts attract diverse kleptoparasites from multiple arthropod lineages, including spiders, flies, ants and bugs. Social spiders are also favored hosts likewise building large and complex webs. The most diverse communities, indeed, form in social spider webs, which have hosts that are more tolerant of co-inhabitants than solitary spiders and generally lack sticky silk. In such webs kleptoparasites bound, but also many arthropods scavenge leftovers and detritus, like beetles and lepidopteran larvae. The spectrum of kleptoparasitism in spider webs is broad, encompassing obligate kleptoparasites like argyrodine theridiids, facultative prey thieves, web invaders, and even commensals that exploit spider webs without stealing resources useful to the host. Some kleptoparasites feed opportunistically on prey remnants, while others engage in stealthy theft or aggressive food robbery. Additionally, spiders themselves exhibit secondary kleptoparasitism, with some species abandoning their own webs to invade and exploit the webs of other spiders (kleptotany). This facultative kleptoparasitism is seen in multiple lineages and can involve resource theft, web takeover, or even direct predation on the host (araneophagy). These interactions suggest a complex evolutionary pathway, where facultative kleptotany may serve as a transition to obligate kleptoparasitism. This review highlights the importance of spiders in kleptoparasitic networks and suggests that further phylogenetic and ecological analyses are necessary to fully understand the evolutionary history of kleptoparasitism, and the assembly of kleptoparasitic species into host webs. **7 Future directions** Despite substantial progress in understanding spiders as superhosts and secondary kleptoparasites, this review reveals several key areas that urgently require future research. **7.1 Phylogenetic context of kleptoparasitism** While facultative kleptoparasitism and kleptotany (here) have been hypothesized as precursors to obligate kleptoparasitism, robust phylogenetic analyses are necessary to establish evolutionary transitions. Future work should focus on constructing comprehensive phylogenetic trees incorporating all kleptoparasitic and host lineages to discern evolutionary patterns and seek signatures of possible coevolutionary arms race between kleptoparasites and host. **7.2 Mechanisms of host selection and assembly into host webs** Further investigation is needed into how kleptoparasites locate, evaluate, and establish themselves in host webs. Ecological studies on species colonization, composition in host webs, and intra- and interspecific competition would clarify what rules may govern species assembly into these habitat islands. Studies employing behavioral assays and chemical ecology approaches should clarify the role of airborne cues, such as pheromones or web-borne signals, in host detection and selection. **7.3 Impact of kleptoparasitism on host fitness and web dynamics** Although some hosts appear resilient to kleptoparasitism, long-term studies tracking web persistence, prey capture rates, and reproductive success in the presence of kleptoparasites would provide a clearer picture of costs and benefits to hosts. Evaluating host responses to kleptoparasites in relation to species and kleptoparasite load could cast light on what strategies may be evolutionary responses to this type of resource theft. In particular, if both facultative and obligatory web takedown and relocation are influenced by kleptoparasitism, then web takedown may play a role in explaining the absence of kleptoparasites from the majority of spider webs. **7.4 Geographic and environmental influences** The distribution and abundance of kleptoparasites across different biogeographic regions remain underexplored. Comparative studies examining kleptoparasitism in varying climates, habitats, and ecological contexts, and the biogeography of kleptoparasites among geographical and habitat islands, would enhance understanding of environmental factors shaping these interactions. **7.5 Behavioral plasticity and evolutionary transitions** Some species exhibit facultative kleptoparasitism in specific contexts, suggesting behavioral plasticity that may facilitate evolutionary shifts. Experimental studies investigating the conditions under which facultative kleptoparasitism is expressed could illuminate pathways to obligate kleptoparasitism. **7.6 Community-level interactions in multi-species webs** Spider webs are often interlinked and can form multi-species assemblages. Given that existing studies suggest such web clusters are more than the combination of their parts, further research is needed to explore the dynamics of kleptoparasite assemblies in such transient communities. In particular, in what context do webs of species that are normally deferred become attractive to kleptoparasites? Understanding this context may offer key insight into the host traits that attract and detract kleptoparasites. **7.7 Application of (advanced) tracking technologies** An almost entirely unexplored field of study is that of tracking movement of kleptoparasites among host webs. Simple techniques like paint or dust tagging would allow the movement of individual kleptoparasites to be tracked and could provide novel insights into assembly into host webs, dispersal, and long-term site fidelity of kleptoparasitic spiders. The use of modern tracking tools, such as harmonic tags or miniature radio-frequency identification (micro RFID) tags would be ideal and is certainly feasible to track larger host species. The smallest harmonic tags may also be useful for tracking kleptoparasites and such data would lend themselves well to machine-learning-based behavioral analysis. **7.8 Molecular \u2018tracking\u2019 of kleptoparasites** A few studies have started to use modern sequencing methods to understand kinship and local adaptation in kleptoparasitic spiders. Population genomics offers tools that will advance our understanding on dispersal, kinship of individuals within host webs (potentially underlying some cooperative behavior), and host specialization. Such data may be pivotal in gaining complete understanding of species assembly into host webs. Addressing these knowledge gaps will not only refine our understanding of kleptoparasitism in spiders but also contribute to broader ecological and evolutionary theories on community ecology, assembly rules, resource exploitation, parasitism, and host-parasite dynamics. **Data availability statement** The data analyzed in this study is subject to the following licenses/restrictions: Some unpublished sequence data from collaborative ongoing work was used to inform on the summary phylogeny.
