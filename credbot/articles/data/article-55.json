Blum,Maxime Rageot, andTobias M\u00fchlenbruch Since its discovery during Heinrich Schliemann\u2019s excavations at Troy, thedepas amphikypellon, a cylindrical goblet with two curved handles which is thought to be the goblet mentioned in Homer\u2019s epics, has been considered a potential drinking vessel for wine. Recent biomolecular investigations by the Institute of Prehistory, Early History, and Medieval Archaeology in T\u00fcbingen confirm this hypothesis by identifying high concentrations of fruit acids indicative of regular use specifically for wine\u2014though these same acids were also found in cups and beakers from Troy. This raises questions regarding the social and cultural significance of the beverage: while previously perceived as an exclusive emblem of the Early Bronze Age elite, wine consumption may have been more widespread than previously assumed. Further examinations at other sites could reveal whether a wider range of vessels were utilized for wine elsewhere, potentially challenging current assumptions about the distribution and consumption of wine during the third millennium BCE.
