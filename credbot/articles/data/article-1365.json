However, officers have also tacked on a hate-motivated component to the charge, after consulting with their force\u2019s hate crimes coordinator. According to police, the incident happened Nov. 5 when a large group of about 1,000 protesters\u2013both pro-Israel and pro-Palestinian\u2013each held their weekly competing demonstrations on Macleod Trail S.E. Calgary police have regularly advised protest leaders what they can and cannot do or say at these recurring events, including some wording on signs or breaking hate speech laws or blocking roads. \u201cThrough amplification and a public address system, [the accused] acknowledged this conversation with police. He then proceeded to repeatedly use an anti-Semitic phrase while encouraging the crowd to follow along,\u201d the police news release said. Calgary\u2019s Wesam Cooley, also known as Wesam Khaled, is scheduled to appear in court again on Dec. 19. Cooley was released on bail and barred from attending any further protests. The use of the phrase \u201cFrom the River to the Sea, Palestine will be free\u201d has been interpreted of late by the Jewish community as advocating for the dismantling of the Jewish state, in order to create a homeland for Palestinians. The Jewish Federation of Calgary thanked the city police for taking swift action after the weekend protest against a person \u201cwho was publicly inciting hate\u201d, according to a statement posted on the Jewish organization\u2019s Facebook page on Nov. 7. \u201cThis arrest will hopefully set a precedent not only in Calgary but in other cities,\u201d the group added. Calgary police have made multiple arrests in connection with local protests since Oct. 7, the start of the current Israel-Hamas war. They have detained people for a variety of reasons including breach of peace, uttering threats, assault and also assault with a weapon, following \u201cincidents of violence\u201d. However, it isn\u2019t clear whether anyone was actually charged in connection with these other arrests. The Nov. 5 charge against Cooley is the first targeting someone for hate-motivated reasons against the Jewish community. [Ed note: On Nov 8, Calgary police also announced they\u2019ve laid a new hate-motivated charge, against a 25-year old Calgary man, for making threatening online social media posts targeting the local Jewish community. Mohamad Ghandour faces three counts of uttering threats. He will next appear in court Dec. 6, 2023.] Supporters of Cooley, a well-known Palestinian activist, are calling for the charges to be dropped, deny any hate-crime was committed, and accuse Calgary police of bowing to pressure from those trying to silence legitimate protest and to demonize Palestinian voices. \u201cWe must underscore that his arrest occurred as an ambush rather than an arrest for an observable offence,\u201d said the Calgary branch of the group Justice for Palestinians, ina media release. \u201cTo our knowledge, there are no legislation or bylaws criminalizing protest speech calling for justice and liberation of an oppressed population undergoing a genocide by a belligerent oppressor state.\u201d The anti-Israel group Canadians for Peace and Justice in the Middle East (CJPME) also condemned the charge and called it \u201cspurious\u201d. \u201cWe are appalled at the shocking overreach of the Alberta government in carrying out this arrest, which is an example of anti-Palestinian racism,\u201d said Thomas Woodley, president of CJPME, in a release. For their part, the Calgary police say they are only enforcing the law, not clamping down on activism from anyone. \u201cWe will continue to police behaviours, not beliefs,\u201d the police department\u2019s news release said. In Canada, a conviction for the crime of \u201cdisturbing the peace\u201d carries a maximum penalty of up to 6 months in jail or a $5,000 fine, or both, and a criminal record. However, when prosecutors add the hate-motivated tag to a summary charge, it gives a judge wider leeway to impose higher penalties during sentencing, according to legal experts. It\u2019s not the first time Cooley has come to public attention in Calgary for supporting the use of extreme language toward Jews in Israel. A decade ago, while he was the president of the University of Calgary\u2019s campus club known as Solidarity for Palestinian Human Rights, he came to the defence of a previous club leader whose Facebook posts drew complaints from a local pro-Israel group. In 2014, Cooley told theNational Postat the time that the violent posts describing a \u201cbloody\u201d kaffiyeh of a Palestinian martyr were misinterpreted, because they had been written as \u201cfiction\u201d and \u201cpoetry.\u201d Canadian police have now laid hate-motivated charges against 13 people related to the current Middle East situation: Calgary police charged a25-year-old manon Nov. 7 with three counts of uttering threats in connection with a series of online social media posts targeting the Jewish community in Calgary. Mohamad Ghandour will appear in court again on Dec. 6. Calgary police have charged a32-year-old manwith disturbing the peace, in connection with a Nov. 5 pro-Palestinian protest rally in the city.
