Vinegar can sub for glass cleaners, fabric softeners, and deodorizers. Avoid using vinegar to disinfect or on porous surfaces like wood and stone. Vinegar is an eco-friendly alternative to many commercial cleaning products like glass cleaners and even fabric softeners. However, vinegar's famed versatility also has its limitations. This natural cleaner has many applications, but we spoke with two experts in the cleaning industry to discover exactly which cleaners vinegar can replace and which it shouldn't. **Meet the Expert** Ahmed Mezilis the founder and CEO at Hellamaid. Jon Ridingis the owner and founder of Evergreen Cleaning Company. **Can You Replace Your Cleaning Products With Vinegar?** Althoughvinegar is undeniably a versatile cleaning solution, our experts agree that it should not be your only cleaning solution. \"Vinegar has its place as a natural, eco-friendly cleaner, but it\u2019s not a cure-all,\" says Jon Riding, the owner and founder of Evergreen Cleaning Company. Likewise, Ahmed Mezil, the founder and CEO at Hellamaid, says vinegar is a great solution for tackling issues like grease and mineral build-up, but it's not a viable replacement for disinfectants like bleach. \"It's a great eco-friendly alternative more than anything,\" Mezil says, \"[but] it's not a one-size-fits all solution.\" Riding and Mezil agree that vinegar is an reliable cleaner, but it's important to pair it with the right products for proper sanitation and surface care.

To make your ownvinegar-based glass cleaner, combine equal parts water and vinegar in a spray bottle and use as you would any commercial cleaner. If you want to mitigate the vinegar smell, just add a few drops of your favorite essential oil. **Hard Water Stain Remover** In addition to grease and oil, the acetic acid in vinegar can dissolve tough stains from mineral deposits. For this reason, Mezil and Riding agree that vinegar is an excellent solution for removing stains and build-up from hard water and limescale. This especially applies to many kitchen and bathroom surfaces, including faucets, showerheads, and even kettles. **Fabric Softener** Vinegar is a great addition to your laundry routine, because it not only breaks down build-up from minerals in your water, but also residue from your detergent. Vinegar does not have any dyes and other additives commonly found in commercial products that can irritate the skin, and it is also an excellent deodorizer, rather than adding scents like many alternative fabric softeners. If you'd like tosubstitute your fabric softener with vinegar, Riding and Mezil suggest adding 1/2 a cup of vinegar directly to your washer at the beginning of the rinse cycle to soften the laundry. **All-Purpose Cleaner** If you'd like to make your ownhomemade general surface cleaner, look no further than vinegar. It's non-toxic, natural, and affordable to boot. Although vinegar is not an ideal cleaner for surfaces like wood and natural stone, it's a great option for removing stuck-on grime and even potent odors from a variety of other areas of the home. \"It works great for cleaning everyday messes on non-porous, sealed surfaces like tile or laminate,\" says Riding. **Deodorizing Spray** While there are certainly a number of air fresheners available at your local grocery store, many of these mask odors by covering them with another scent like lemon or lavender. Vinegar, on the other hand, is a safe and cheap alternative that manages odors by addressing the source of the stench, typically bacteria and build-up. It's also quick and easy tomake your own vinegar-based room spray. \"Mix vinegar with water and essential oils for a natural room spray,\" Mezil says. **Which Cleaners Shouldn't You Replace With Vinegar?** Although it's well-established that vinegar is a strong multipurpose cleaner, Riding and Mezil are quick to add thatthere are a few situations where vinegar isn\u2019t safe or effective. Disinfectants: \"Vinegar doesn\u2019t kill most harmful bacteria and viruses, so it shouldn\u2019t replace disinfectants,\" Riding says. Natural Stone Cleaners: Mezil says vinegar can etch and damage natural stone surfaces likegraniteandmarble, so it's best to use a cleaner formulated for natural stone. Wood Cleaners: Stick with cleaning solutions designed uniquely for wood surfaces, as vinegar can strip the protective coatings onwood furnitureandhardwood floorsand may even cause warping or discoloration over time. Cleaning Solution for Electronics: Avoid using vinegar to clean the screens on your electronic devices, as \"acidic vinegar can damage [or] peel protective coatings,\" Mezil says.
