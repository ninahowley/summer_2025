Home generators have become a necessity for homeowners, especially in areas prone to power outages due to unpredictable weather conditions. As such, it is crucial that prospective buyers understand the various storage options available and what the installation process entails. This knowledge will aid in making informed decisions on which generator best suits their needs. **Storage Options** When it comes to the storage of home generators, there are primarily two options: portable and standby generators. Portable Generators: These are small, movable units designed for temporary use. They run on gasoline or diesel and can be stored easily in a garage or tool shed when not in use. Portable generators need to be manually started and require an extension cord to connect to your appliances. Standby Generators: These are large, permanent units that are installed outside your home. Standby generators automatically start when a power outage is detected and can run on various types of fuel including natural gas, propane, or diesel. Due to their size, they require a dedicated area for installation. **Installation Process** The installation process for home generators varies based on the model chosen but generally includes these steps: Site Preparation: The first step involves selecting an appropriate location for the generator. This should be relatively flat, easily accessible for maintenance and away from windows or vents due to exhaust emissions. Fuel Source Connection: The next step involves connecting your generator to its fuel source which could be propane, natural gas or diesel depending upon your choice of generator. Electrical Wiring: After this is done, an automatic transfer switch (ATS) is installed near your electrical panel by a licensed electrician. This switch automatically transfers power from the utility line to the generator during a power outage. Testing: Finally after everything is set up properly, thorough testing should be conducted by running the generator under load conditions to confirm functioning as per expected norms. Bear in mind that while it is possible to install a generator yourself, it\u2019s highly recommended to hire a professional. This ensures the installation adheres to local codes and safety standards. Moreover, improper installation can void the warranty of your generator. **Maintenance and Storage** Proper maintenance and storage are key to prolonging the life of your generator. Regularly checking oil levels, changing filters, and periodically running the unit even when there\u2019s no outage will keep it in good working condition. For portable generators, storing them in a dry place away from harsh weather conditions will help prevent damage. In summary, understanding your storage options and the installation process for home generators is key in making an informed buying decision. An educated homeowner can then balance their specific needs with the features offered by various models, ensuring they are prepared for any future power outages.
