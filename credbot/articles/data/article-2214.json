Jean is an experienced fixer for journalists who often finds himself on the subject side of stories. In these audio recordings, Jean describes his life in Haiti and his reluctant emigration across the island to the Dominican Republic, where he doesn\u2019t speak the language and faces increasingly difficult discrimination and immigration challenges. Jean\u2019s house in Port-au-Prince has been stolen, his family has experienced kidnapping and attacks, and work is impossible to find. He\u2019s been living on the streets, separated from his wife. He\u2019s exhausted and sick. On the bus to Santiago, Dominican Republic, Jean considers the hurdles to legally emigrate from Haiti to the Dominican Republic and how it feels to leave his wife and some of his children behind. Two of his daughters, already living in Santiago, will receive him when he arrives. While in the DR, Jean works in a call center, serving US customers with his American English skills, garnered from his childhood and early adulthood as an American, before Clinton administration policies deported him to Haiti, a country he hadn\u2019t seen since early childhood. Without Spanish skills and in a time hostile to Haitian immigrants, Jean feels isolated in the DR and, in the early morning, he considers other possibilities, including returning to the Bahamas to find his birth certificate and discover what day he was born. PART1: Jean reflects on his time in the DR, including working at the call center and the cycle of being deported back to Haiti and returning to the DR. PART2: Back in Port-au-Prince, Jean lives on and off the streets and is separated from his family. **Photos** Jean with Laura, one of his editors, in Santiago, Dominican Republic, August 2024.
