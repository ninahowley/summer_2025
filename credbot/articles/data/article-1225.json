screening device was OK\u2018d by the FDA** The Teal Wand is the first self-collection device of its kind for home use The FDA has approved the Teal Wand, a new device for at-home cervical cancer screening. Nicole Morrison/Teal Health **Share this:** Email Facebook Reddit Twitter Print ByMeghan Rosen May 15, 2025 at 1:00 pm Screening for cervical cancer many soon be possible within the privacy of your own home. On May 9, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved theTeal Wand, a tamponlike tool people can use to collect cells from their vagina. It\u2019s the first self-collection device approved for at-home use in the United States and could broaden access to cervical cancer screening. The concept is simple. Patients swab themselves with the wand then send it back to Teal Health, the company that makes the device, for analysis. It\u2019s looking for traces of HPV, the virus to blame for nearly all cervical cancer cases. According to Teal Health,Wand rollout will begin in June in Californiaand later nationwide. The company\u2019s medical providers will prescribe the device to eligible patients, who will be able to access their results via Teal Health\u2019s telehealth service. **Sign up for our newsletter** We summarize the week's scientific breakthroughs every Thursday. \u201cI think it\u2019s very exciting,\u201d says Barbara Goff, a gynecologic oncologist at Fred Hutch Cancer Center and the University of Washington School of Medicine in Seattle. \u201cIt expands cervical cancer screening to more women, which is good. And it makes [screening] more comfortable, which is also good.\u201d In 2025, scientists predict that the United States will see more than13,000 new cases of cervical cancer, and more than 4,000 deaths due to the disease. Overall, the rate of new cervical cancer cases has been inching downward for decades. But those numbers mask a much more nuanced \u2014 and unfortunate \u2014 story, says Trisha Amboree, a cancer epidemiologist at the Medical University of South Carolina Hollings Cancer Center in Charleston. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing really concerning trends, particularly in low-income groups and in rural groups.\u201d In rural U.S. counties,cervical cancer incidence is actually creeping up, Amboree\u2019s team reported inJAMA Network Openin March. The work builds on research she and her colleagues published last yearlinking low county-level income (less than about $40,000 per year) to a recent rise in cervical cancer diagnosesin non-Hispanic white woman. The rise was small, with rates growing from 11.9 per 100,000 women in 2007 to 13.6 per 100,000 women in 2019. But Amboree\u2019s team also saw an increase in late diagnoses, after cancer had spread from the cervix to other parts of the body. That\u2019s when the disease, which is highly treatable when caught early, tends to have a much lower survival rate. Early screening could prevent such cancers and also curb cases in American Indian, Alaska Native, Hispanic and Black women, who have thehighest incidence of the disease.Butscreening rates are down across the board, especially among Black and Hispanic women. About 74 percent of Black women and 67 percent of Hispanic women were up to date with cervical cancer screening in 2023, the National Cancer Institute estimates. That\u2019s compared to about 80 percent of white women. There\u2019s a laundry list of issues that prevents people from getting screened. \u201cMany people just find going to the gynecologist uncomfortable or embarrassing, so they avoid cervical cancer screening,\u201d Goff says. Others may live in \u201cOB-GYN deserts\u201d and simply don\u2019t have access to doctors, she says. Even if people do have a doctor, they can run into logistical challenges, Amboree says, like \u201cactually having time for an appointment, scheduling childcare and taking time off work.\u201d Cervical cancer screening isn\u2019t always at the top of people\u2019s priority list, she says. But with this type of cancer, people can dial down their individual risk. They can get thehighly effective HPV vaccine, Gardasil-9, whichprotects against nine types of the virus, and they can schedule regular cervical cancer screenings. With Pap smears, for instance, doctors can identify abnormal cells that can be removed before they turn cancerous. The Teal Wand adds yet another tool to the cancer-prevention toolbox. If patients test positive, Amboree says, they should follow-up with a doctor for additional care. Both she and Goff are looking forward to finding out whether the wand will boost cervical cancer screening rates nationwide \u00ad\u2014 and how people will respond to using it. \u201cIs this something that women are actually interested in doing?\u201d Amboree says. If there\u2019s one thing Amboree wishes she could scream from the mountaintops, she says, it\u2019s the importance of taking steps like these to prevent the disease. Because, for the most part, she says, \u201ccervical cancer is very preventable.\u201d Sponsor Message Questions or comments on this article?
