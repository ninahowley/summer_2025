But the story behind this convenience store makes it more than just a place you can enjoy your favorite treats. Where there was once tragedy, now stands a small business giving opportunities to youth in the community. In July of 2023, there was a mass shooting in the area of South Hackley and Willard St. resulting in many injuries and one death. Owner of P.O.P Shop, Paris, Powell, was a victim of the shooting and still carries this traumatic experience as he runs his new shop.

Especially for the body of experiences that I\u2019ve had in my life, I still wasn\u2019t traumatized for the fact of fear or anything like that, but traumatized by being powerless to do anything about that particular night,\u201d Powell said. After returning to his home in Florida, Powell didn\u2019t see much progress in the area where the shooting occurred. Powell then decided to take matters into his own hands. \u201cThat\u2019s a big thing in our culture and our community, is that we bury so much pain, and we bury so much trauma that it becomes- we basically become immune to it. And indifferent to it to a fact that we think we can do nothing about it,\u201d said Powell. The P.O.P Shop\u2019s acronym stands for Purpose Over Profit, and administers this by employing teenagers to work during after-school hours. Nakita Reed, Powell\u2019s fianc\u00e9, has been alongside him through this journey, helping paint the shop and working around the store. \u201cHe started from the bottom. I mean this was a pit where didn\u2019t nobody wanted to hang out anymore. So he turned it into a positive environment for kids to improve themselves, grow,\u201d Nakita said. Powell had no history in business, so he took a semester of Ball State\u2019s Impact X class to help formulate his shop. Learning more about the intersection of entrepreneurship and community, Powell said he found this class helpful to the structure of his business. Powell plans to have an official grand opening in the Spring, and pushing towards making a Purpose Over Profit.
