On June 6, a brand-new Trader Joe\u2019s opened in Sherman Oaks, California, part of the grocery chain\u2019s plan toopen 21 stores across 13 states. This particular store, however, is different from the rest for one glaring reason: It\u2019s directly across the street from a Trader Joe\u2019s that has been open for decades. The new store, located at 14140 Riverside Drive, is affectionately called \u201cSherman Oaks too\u201d on theTrader Joe\u2019s website, and its address is only 21 digits different from its sister store at 14119 Riverside Drive. Both groceries open at 8 a.m. and close at 9 p.m. daily. Needless to say, area customers are confused. \u201cWant to know something actually insane?\u201d local customer Shauna Greensays in a June 7 TikTokwhile pointing out the pair of TJ\u2019s in her view. \u201cLiterally across the street, still open. And I just asked the worker, I\u2019m like, \u2018How long is the other Trader Joe\u2019s gonna stay open?\u2019 and she said, \u2018Um, they just signed their lease.\u2019\u201d Green says she\u2019d understand more if it were in a different part of the city, but across the street seems \u201cexcessive.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not a bad problem to have; it\u2019s just a perplexing situation,\u201d she tells TODAY.com. In the comments of her video, people expressedconfusionandjealousy. Many said the move wasstraightout ofStarbucks\u2019playbook\u2014 a clear sign of the \u201cchainification\u201d of a neighborhood. \u201cThere are three Starbucks in Westchester by LAX, two Standalone and one in Ralph\u2019s all across from each other,\u201dwroteone TikTok user. Matt Judd, who is Team Lead at the Sherman Oaks too location, says both locations are going to just \u201cplay it out and see how it goes\u201d as there is enough demand in the area. \u201cI think all along we intended to close the one original one that had been there since 1973, a bit of an undersized store and then somewhere along the line, we decided maybe we could see how two goes for a little bit,\u201d Judd tells TODAY.com. \u201cThere\u2019s that much business here, and we\u2019ve had such a great relationship with our customers for 52 years.\u201d Judd also notes that the \u201cmore modern\u201d store is \u201cabout 40% bigger\u201d with wider aisles, bigger refrigeration and a larger frozen section. A manager at the original Sherman Oaks Trader Joe\u2019s directed us to the corporate office, which declined to comment further on its neighboring stores. Online, some customers have noted the upgrades at the new store, with one TikToker in aJune 9 videoshowing the new parking garage and \u201cspacious\u201d interior. ConsideringTrader Joe\u2019s reputation for terrible parking, Green welcomes the larger spaces. \u201cThe other parking lot is a TJ\u2019s cliche, it\u2019s hell. Cramped and compact spaces with tight turns and a nonstop gridlock,\u201d she says. \u201cMy plan is to go wherever the parking is better.\u201d Joseph Lamour is the food reporter at TODAY.com and is based in Washington D.C. **More Trending** **Cory Booker Reveals He Once Went On A Date With Mariah Carey.
