Borrowing a biblical phrase \u2013 \u201cWoe unto them that decree unrighteous decrees\u201d [Isaiah 10:1] \u2013 is what got activist and then-editor of the Western Labor News J.S. Woodsworth thrown in jail in the summer of 1919 for seditious libel during the Winnipeg General Strike. One hundred years later, at the same spot where young men pushed over a street car in a riot,APTN Investigates: Unmutedfocuses on a contemporary way of silencing labour voices with a non-disclosure agreement, or NDA. The episode opens with a small workers\u2019 meeting \u2013 organized by the reporter \u2013 at Winnipeg\u2019s monument to the violent culmination of the 1919 strike, which dramatically depicts a day known as Bloody Saturday when a streetcar was pushed over and two were shot dead by the North-West Mounted Police. The Bloody Saturday monument is fittingly a streetcar tilted over just like the real one was back in 1919. For City of Winnipeg employee and proud M\u00e9tis man Dennis Smith, it helps to meet at the epicentre of Winnipeg\u2019s labour history and commiserate with others \u2013 like his advocate, self-described \u201crecovering politician\u201d Dougald Lamont, who until recently led the provincial Liberals and Marcel Williamson, who formerly worked for the province in IT support. \u201cIt\u2019s good, it\u2019s empowering, it\u2019s nice to see other people stepping forward because that\u2019s what we need,\u201d says Smith. \u201cStep forward, speak, even if you have an NDA case too.\u201d Smith called Lamont one day to ask for help with a situation he was struggling with at work. \u201cSo, he says, \u2018I was working in this department where they do inspections,\u2019\u201d says Lamont. \u201cAnd I knew what he was talking about because there had been an investigation \u2013 private investigators had been hired and they found out that all these people weren\u2019t doing their jobs.\u201d Employees in the department were caught on video doing errands, shopping and not going to work. This was a news story in 2019, and eight employees were fired and 20 employees in total were disciplined. But not Dennis Smith \u2013 he was doing his job just fine and wasn\u2019t disciplined. The people Smith worked with seemed to believe he was involved with the anonymous group of citizens who funded the surveillance of the city workers. \u201cI was by the photocopier one day and a guy says, \u2018if I find out who\u2019s the rat, I\u2019m going to freaking kill him,\u2019\u201d says Smith. \u201cAnd I said, \u2018buddy, are you accusing me of something? I\u2019m the only one standing here.\u2019\u201d This was just one incident in a campaign of harassment Smith says he endured at work, which included someone reprogramming his phone so it would forward calls elsewhere, spraying cologne over his desk area, breaking his stapler and taping over the microphone on his phone. Lamont has listened to all of Smith\u2019s stories about the way he\u2019s treated at work and believes it\u2019s related to the media expos\u00e9 of goings-on in the department. \u201cHe\u2019s been abused and treated horribly when he\u2019s the one person in the department who\u2019s been honest and has been trying to get things done properly,\u201d says Lamont. Smith\u2019s misery at work hit bottom at a meeting called to try to deal with the ongoing problems he was encountering. In the meeting, Smith suggested hiring an Indigenous mediator to which a manager said, \u201cI\u2019m not hiring no Indian.\u201d Things got so bad that Smith went on a Workers Compensation Board-endorsed medical leave for just over a year, with a psychological injury related to his experiences at work. Throughout the ordeal, Smith felt unsupported by the union, especially, he says, when they negotiated a deal on his behalf, which involved signing an NDA and an offer of $20,000 in compensation. \u201cHe had to sign an NDA which means he would be absolutely forbidden from ever speaking to anyone, speaking the truth to anyone,\u201d says Lamont. \u201cHe\u2019s not the one who\u2019s done anything wrong so he\u2019s being asked to keep a secret that other people have done wrong and he\u2019s still being punished in my view. \u201cSo, they expected him to be silent. They offered him that money only if he was silent and part of the deal was that he loses his job. What the hell kind of deal is that?\u201d APTN Investigatesreached out to Smith\u2019s union CUPE [the Canadian Union of Public Employees] as well as the City of Winnipeg requesting interviews. CUPE has not responded and the city sent a statement saying that \u201call City of Winnipeg employees are entitled to be treated fairly and with dignity, free from harassment or discrimination in the workplace.\u201d Even though Smith rejected the offer and didn\u2019t sign, he discovered the city had deposited $20,000 into his account anyway, without his permission. Smith had his bank return the money. \u2018Can\u2019t Buy My Silence\u2019 A brave move on his part and one that lawyer and NDA expert Julie MacFarlane admires. \u201cI think it showed real initiative and courage,\u201d says MacFarlane, \u201cand that\u2019s something that we like to support people to do, to push back.\u201d MacFarlane is a former law professor who co-leads an international campaign against the misuse of NDAs called Can\u2019t Buy My Silence. There\u2019s a myth, MacFarlane says, that NDAs bring closure for people in situations like Dennis Smith\u2019s. \u201cThe reality is that NDAs don\u2019t bring people closure,\u201d says MacFarlane. \u201cWe hear constantly that this means they have an albatross around their necks for the rest of their lives because the NDA is forever and they must live in constant trepidation of breaking the agreement and possibly therefore forfeiting their compensation.\u201d MacFarlane advocates for legislation that restricts the use of a non-disclosure agreement in silencing victims of harassment or sexual misconduct. Prince Edward Island already has itsNon-disclosure Agreements Actwhich took effect in 2022 and MacFarlane is supporting the development of similar legislation in Manitoba. \u201cI think that Manitoba with the very large Indigenous community and the clear evidence that we have that this is having a disproportionate impact on Indigenous people, gives them even more reason to want to be in the forefront of this,\u201d says MacFarlane. When he was an MLA, Dougald Lamont introduced NDA bills twice \u2013 in 2022 and 2023 \u2013 but they died both times. As part of Lamont\u2019s legislative efforts, a committee hearing was held to give people silenced by NDAs an opportunity to speak. Marcel Williamson \u2013 a Winnipegger with roots in Shoal Lake 39 Ojibwe Nation and Fisher River First Nation \u2013 was one of the people who testified. Like Dennis Smith, Williamson chose to refuse the NDA that had been presented to him with an offer of compensation by management. Shared Health Manitoba terminated Williamson\u2019s job after he complained about a number of incidents that he alleges he endured, including racist comments and assaults. While admitting to just one of Williamson\u2019s allegations [that a supervisor had broken a respectful workplace policy when he used the term \u201cwarpath\u201d in a meeting to describe angry department clients] management presented him with an offer of over $60,000 in compensation \u2013 which Williamson rejected, along with the NDA that came with the offer. APTN requested an interview with Shared Health but they provided a statement instead. \u201cWhile we will not discuss individual employment matters, we can confirm that, as part of the standard process for resolving employment terminations, a non-disclosure agreement is included in the final settlement terms. However, it would be inaccurate to suggest that financial settlements are provided solely in exchange for signing an NDA.\u201d Williamson is hopeful the NDP government under Ojibway author, journalist, and rapper \u2013 Premier Wab Kinew \u2013 will do something to bolster his position in negotiating a better outcome. \u201cHopefully with this government, the new NDP government under Mr. Kinew, we can maybe rehash that and see what the options are,\u201d says Williamson. And provincial Justice Minister Matt Wiebe is keeping the door open on a new NDA bill. \u201cWe\u2019re looking forward to meeting further with Professor McFarlane and very interested in the work that she\u2019s done in researching this and bringing together some of these ideas for us to continue to listen to and look at,\u201d says Wiebe. Dennis Smith still has his job with the City of Winnipeg, and wants to keep it \u2013 so he may have the most to lose. He\u2019s hired a lawyer to pursue a more satisfactory resolution, but whatever comes out of that can\u2019t repair the effect this has had on him and his family. \u201cBasically everything that I\u2019ve been put through has changed my DNA,\u201d says Smith. \u201cI used to be the happiest, most lucky guy that you would ever meet.
