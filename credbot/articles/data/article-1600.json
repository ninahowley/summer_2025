Giving them the tools and the facilities that they need as they continue to serve and protect and render aid to those in need,\" said Moosic Mayor Bob Bennie. The more than $3 million project sits behind the original Greenwood Hose Company along Birney Avenue. Firefighter Brittain Banull says the new home offers more opportunities that their current location of 47 years just can't handle. \u201cThis will offer us more space to get new apparatus to be able to serve Moosic in better ways, in the proper ways. And with that it'll also allow us the opportunity to be able to train. This building has dedicated areas for rope systems we could set up,\" said Banull. \"It's got bigger spaces to store stuff.\u201d Inside the building, Moosic Police Chief Rick Janesko can see his officers\u2019 future department taking shape. \u201cSo there'll be a cove here. They can go into. Someone comes to the window, we have to buzz them in the door, buzz them in if they need a copy of a report or need to speak to an officer,\u201d said Chief Janesko. Over the last 3 years, Janesko and his team have operated out of a leased property along Springbrook Avenue. While it's worked out, he's eager for more space. \u201cI'm grateful for the officers that work in Moosic Borough, that come out every day,\" said Janesko. \"And you know, again, we're in a makeshift police station, and they come out every day and do their job without question.\u201d As work continues, both departments are eager to move in so they can continue serving their community. \u201cThe community will be able to come in here and see our new location,\" said Janesko. \"They see the police cars driving around, but they don't actually see our building, and this is going to be our home for many, many years.\u201d \u201cIt really offers that opportunity to see each other regularly, to really know what's going on, to be able to work and operate together on a regular basis,\u201d said Banull. While the cornerstone is in place, the rest of the construction is set to wrap up at the end of the summer. **Before You Leave, Check This Out** Jobs Terms of Service Privacy Policy Ad Choices EEO Public File Report FCC Online Public Inspection File Closed Caption Procedures Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information"}
