The concern at Blue Heron Golf Club in Wayne County is that the new owners want to build homes on the fairways. The golf course sent a note to members yesterday saying next year, Blue Heron will \u201ctransition to a nine-hole layout.\u201d The message began \u201cWe want to take a moment to address of the concerns that have been circulating regarding the future of the golf course.\u201d The note said the course will remain open for the \u201cremainder of the season\u201d and that \u201cno refunds will be issued.\u201d There is awebsiteof a company advertising to people to build their dream homes here. The website is Windward Lake Homes LLC. The video on the main page of the website is the 18th hole at Blue Heron. The page says \u201cbuild your dream home\u201d and it includes a map that highlights the border of the golf course. New York State Department of State records show Windward Lake Homes LLC was created on January 6, 2025. The name listed is William Calder, the father of the club\u2019s new owner. The owner, Jason Calder, texted News10NBC Chief Investigative Reporter Berkeley Brean, writing \u201cAt this time, it\u2019s too preliminary to discuss. My family won\u2019t have an application turned into the town for several months.\u201d \u201cAfter having this beautiful view the last thing we want to look at is the back of a house,\u201d Joyce Stadmiller said as she looked out over the course from her deck.Stadmiller has lived on the course for 26 years. Berkeley Brean, News10NBC: \u201cWhat is it that you\u2019re concerned about?\u201d Joyce Stadmiller, lives on Blue Heron Golf Course: \u201cBeing honest we\u2019re concerned what this will do to the value of our home.\u201d Brean talked to members after they putted out on 14. Brean: \u201cIs there one thing you want to hear from the owners?\u201d Joe Seil, Blue Heron member: \u201cYeah, we\u2019d just like them to be transparent and what\u2019s their real plan. We had a meet and greet a couple of months ago and this topic came up and they didn\u2019t say anything about building homes on the golf course. And I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s their plan long term.\u201d Jack Nicklaus helped design Blue Heron. Arnold Palmer played a skins game there in 1995. Blue Heron is one of 61 member courses of the Rochester District Golf Association. In the last 20 years, at least 10 local courses closed and one never opened. Brean received the following statement from the town of Walworth: \u201cThe Town of Walworth has not received an application for the Winward Lake Home Project. The new property owners have not approached any of the Walworth Town Board, Planning Board, or Zoning Board regarding any possible proposed plans for the property. Until an application is filed, the Town will refrain from discourse regarding the property as its future remains conjecture until the point of formal site application.\u201d Some members started apetitionon Change.org. It\u2019s nearing 800 signatures in three days.
