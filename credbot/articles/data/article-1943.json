However, the video is a deepfake and he has not issued any such message. A senior trade delegation from Pakistan isdue in Washingtonthis week for talks with United States officials on the recently imposed American tariffs and related economic issues, diplomatic sources toldDawn. The PTI claims that Field Marshal Asim Munir would visit Washington around the same time, something that neither the US nor Pakistani officials have confirmed. While official dates for these visits are being withheld due to political sensitivities, the PTI, which has long opposed the current Pakistani establishment, has announced plans to stage large-scale demonstrations during the visit. In a tweet posted over the weekend, PTI\u2019s Secretary for Overseas Affairs, Sajjad Burki, called for a protest outside the Pakistan embassy in Washington on June 14, coinciding with the expected presence of senior Pakistani officials in the US capital. On Tuesday, an X user shared an 18-secondclipallegedly showing Barrister Gohar urging overseas Pakistanis to participate in a protest on June 14 against the army chief. The caption of the post read: \u201cBarrister Gohar\u2019s major announcement. Call for a protest demonstration on June 14.\u201d In the clip, Gohar says: \u201cAs the chairman of PTI, I appeal to all overseas Pakistanis living in the US and the West to actively participate in the protest being held on June 14 in front of the Pakistan Embassy in Washington, DC, so that the true face of Field Marshal Munir can be exposed before the world.\u201d The post gained 61,000 views and was shared 619 times. Gohar\u2019s alleged speech wassharedin written form by another X user alongside a photo of his, garnering 46,000 views. The same video was shared by other users on X as can be seenhere,here,hereandhere. The same viral clip was also found on Facebook as can be seenhere,hereandhere, accumulating 12,490 views. The clip was also shared onTikTok. A fact-check was initiated to determine the veracity of the claim due to its high virality and keen public interest in Imran, the PTI\u2019s protest call, the party\u2019s relationship with the military leadership and all related developments. Observing the timeline of the X account that first shared the video showed that the user has the following written in their bio: \u201cAI, memes and satire exposing fascism & corruption in PK.\u201d The user had also shared many other AI-generated images andvideoson their timeline. Observing the video showed inconsistencies such as the lack of direct eye contact with the camera, the line of sight not syncing up with the direction of the face and unnaturally high swaying throughout while speaking, which is not how the PTI leader talks in his addresses and videos. Interestingly, avideoshared by the account of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur of the exact same message, calling for the protest in Washington against the army chief, displayed the same inconsistencies. Analysis of Gohar\u2019s video using tools to detect manipulation showed that Attestiv assigned it a suspicion rating of 57 per cent while the results from Hive Moderation and Deepware were inconclusive. A reverse image search and keyword search for \u201cBarrister Gohar\u201d, \u201cprotest call\u201d, \u201cJune 14\u201d and \u201cWashington\u201d led to no news articles from mainstream media outlets that reported on any such alleged video address by the PTI leader, nor was any recent video message of Gohar found speaking with the same background. Neither result was obtained for CM Gandapur saying anything like that. Instead, avideo clipposted on X the same day by Usman Chaudhry, a researcher and environmental journalist according to his bio, showed Gohar responding to a question about the PTI issuing a protest call during the army chief\u2019s visit to the United States. His response is transcribed below: \u201cThe PTI has not given any protest call and nor does the PTI do it. If people abroad do anything then it is their choice. There has been no such press release from the PTI and nor has the PTI said to anyone to do any protest so from our side, we have not given any such call.\u201d Contacted for comment viaDawncorrespondent Nadir Guramani about the video, Gohar said: \u201cFake and AI-generated\u201d. Therefore, the fact-check determined that the claim that a video shows PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar for a protest in Washington on June 14 against the army chief isfalse. The video is a deepfake and no credible news outlet has reported on any such alleged call by Gohar.
