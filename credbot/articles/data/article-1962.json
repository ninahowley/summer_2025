DATA ROUNDUP **This viral video does not show members of a Hindu organisation making objectionable gestures at Kangana Ranaut during an event; the video is from Pakistan** AAA A video from an event showing a large crowd and a woman standing on stage with a microphone is going viral on social media (here,here, andhere). In the video, some individuals in the audience can be seen making objectionable gestures, including showing the middle finger towards the woman on stage. The video is being shared with the claim that the woman is Bollywood actress Kangana Ranaut, who was allegedly trolled by members of a Hindu organisation during the event. Let\u2019s verify the truth behind the video in this article. Claim:The video shows members of a Hindu organisation making objectionable gestures, including showing the middle finger, towards Bollywood actress and BJP MP Kangana Ranaut during an event. Fact:The video is from the \u2018Pak Wheels\u2019 event in Pakistan, featuring host Farah Hashmi. There are no credible reports of members of Hindu organisations making objectionable gestures towards Kangana Ranaut at any event. The video has no connection to Kangana Ranaut or India. Hence, the claim made in the post isFALSE. Upon closely examining the viral video, we noticed the name \u201cQ-High Street\u201d in the background. A Google searchrevealedthat Q-High Street is a commercial real estate company based in Pakistan. We found the officialInstagram page of Q-High Street, where a post mentions that an automotiveeventcalled \u2018Pak Wheels\u2019 was held at the venue on 25 May. The page has shared several photos from the event. The stage decorations and the text displayed on the screen in those images match exactly with what is seen in the viral video (hereandhere). We also found several YouTube videos from the event (hereandhere). These show that various vehicles were showcased during the auto show, followed by a concert. In one video, the same woman from the viral clip is seen onstage, appearing to host the event. Even in this footage, some people are seenmaking objectionable gestures, including showing her the middle finger. We found that the woman on stage is identified as Farah Hashmi. Her Instagram account features aposterof the \u2018Pak Wheels\u2019 event held on 25 May 2025, which also includes her photo. Farah\u2019s Instagram storyhighlightsalso include a video from the event. Her outfit and the stage setup match the viral video, confirming that she is the same woman seen in the clip. We did not find any credible reports of members of a Hindu organisation making objectionable gestures, such as showing the middle finger, towards Bollywood actress and BJP MP Kangana Ranaut during any event. While we could not find any news reports specifically addressing that clip, the available evidence suggests that the video has no connection to Kangana Ranaut or India. To sum up, this viral video does not show members of a Hindu organisation making objectionable gestures at Kangana Ranaut during an event; the video is from Pakistan. **About Author** **RelatedPosts** Comments are closed.
