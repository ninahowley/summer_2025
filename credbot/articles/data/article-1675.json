China, Russia, North Korea and Iran Are Targets in Pentagon World War III Scenarios** **Hague Court Ruling against China: A 'Side Show'** Image: Prof Michel Chossudovsky On Tuesday, the Hague ruled that China has no legal basis for its claims in the South China Sea. Asked to comment,Michel Chossudovsky,the director of the Montreal-based Center for Research on Globalization, told Sputnik that the Hague \u2018tempest in a teapot\u2019 is much less worrying than Washington\u2019s efforts to militarize the region. There are two central issues, Professor Chossudovsky explained. \u201cOne is the fact that the United States has a project to militarize the Asia Pacific region, specifically threatening China. The other issue is \u2026the [territorial] disputes between China, the Philippines, Vietnam, etc.\u201d The second issue, according to the analyst, would be much easier to resolve if it weren\u2019t for US involvement, which is using the territorial disputes as part of its so-called \u2018pivot to Asia\u2019, \u201cessentially preventing these countries from reaching negotiations, and building a situation of crisis within the Asia-Pacific region.\u201d \u00a9 PHOTO: WIKIPEDIA/VOICE OF AMERICA Leaving aside the details of the ruling itself, Chossudovsky emphasized that when talking about a diplomatic conflict involving the Philippines and China, one has to understand that \u201cwe\u2019re not talking about a conflict between one sovereign nation and another sovereign nation. The Philippines is a former colony of Spain and the United States, and today it remains almost a de facto colony of the United States, in terms of its broad alignments, military cooperation agreements, and so on and so forth.\u201dTherefore, the analyst noted, \u201cwhen the president of the Philippines negotiates with China, he does it in consultation with Washington.\u201d Asked about the prospects of the diplomatic flare-up provoking a new arms race in the region, Chossudovsky suggested that unfortunately, one has already begun. \u201cWe are already in an arms race situation, triggered by the United States.That arms race, at this particular juncture, is essentially directed against four countries \u2013 Russia, China\u2026Iran and North Korea.These are the four countries which are on the drawing board of the Pentagon, and they have been there for many, many years. In all the war games \u2013 the World War 3 scenarios that the Pentagon [plays out] on a routine basis \u2013 these four countries are the targets\u2026This is ultimately what is at stake.\u201d The professor reiterated that the militarization of the South China Sea is \u201cthere for two purposes: for threatening China, and [for preventing] the countries of the region \u2013 of Southeast Asia and the Far East from entering into cooperation agreements which would be more of a regional type.\u201d Such agreements, Chossudovsky noted, would serve as a clear threat to Washington\u2019s efforts to enforce the Trans-Pacific Partnership, aimed at putting countries throughout the region \u201cunder the geopolitical control of the United States.\u201d The professor also emphasized that under normal circumstances, the issue of maritime rights would be resolved through bilateral discussions. A Canadian, Chossudovsky recalled that the United States and Canada also have water boundary disputes. But this doesn\u2019t mean that the Chinese Navy butts in and deploys its own ships to these areas. \u201cIn other words, what I think is deplorable here is that a legal dispute under the laws of the sea is [being] used by the United States to threaten China and militarize strategic waterways in the South China Sea,\u201dthe analyst noted. Ultimately, commenting on other recent developments in the region, from the deployment of theTHAAD missile defense systemin South Korea, to the approval of anaval baseon the island of Jeju, the professor noted that it\u2019s extremely important not to get lost in the details of this ruling. \u201cA legal decision in the Hague is one thing \u2013 it\u2019s a trivial issue, and should lead to bilateral discussions. The other more serious issue is the militarization of that entire region, which incidentally is also related to the militarization of Eastern Europe by NATO; it\u2019s the same process, and is directed against China, Russia, Iran and North Korea; those are the four so-called rogue states defined in US foreign policy,\u201dChossudovsky concluded. * * * Michel Chossudovsky\u2019s Bookcan be ordered directly from Global Research (click image) by Michel Chossudovsky **Related** Comment on Global Research Articles on our Facebook page Become a Member of Global Research **About the author:** Disclaimer:The contents of this article are of sole responsibility of the author(s).
