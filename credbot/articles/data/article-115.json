Corey. Our interns are treated like members of the full-time staff, win awards and go on to work for us and other media organizations. Baltimore Sun Media has one application for all its summer internships. Applicants not picked for the Mary J. Corey Journalism Internship will be considered for other positions. The people selected should have extensive journalism experience, either as a student journalist, or as an intern in a professional newsroom, or a combination of both. Internships will be open to undergraduate students who expect to graduate in 2026 or 2027 or to graduate students who have not worked professionally as a journalist for more than one year. Interns will work in the Sun newsroom for 10-12 weeks sometime between June 1, 2026, and Aug. 31, 2026. (Exact dates will be determined mutually by the intern and Sun editors). Interns will report to a specific editor during internship, though the intern will be given opportunity to work with multiple editors. Mary Corey, a Maryland native who died in 2013 after a long battle with breast cancer, started her career at The Sun as a college intern. Upon her graduation from what is now Notre Dame of Maryland University, she was immediately hired by The Sun as an editorial assistant. She rose through the ranks as a reporter, editor and national correspondent, and in 2010 was named senior vice president and director of content for The Baltimore Sun, making her the first woman in The Sun\u2019s long history to lead the newsroom. During her tenure, Corey spearheaded new print and digital sections while building on The Sun\u2019s long tradition of investigative journalism. By providing readers with well-reported stories, effective graphics and affecting photos, she led The Sun to regional Newspaper of the Year honors in 2011 and 2012. What do Baltimore Sun interns do all day? Interns have all the rights, and responsibilities, of a Baltimore Sun journalist. That means they are expected to come up with story ideas, keep up with the news on their beat, be willing to collaborate with other interns and reporters and file in a timely manner. There are also formal and informal opportunities for interns to interact with the broader newsroom staff. What are some examples of stories authored by interns? Recent interns havecataloged the status of challenged books, profiled afamily\u2019s push for accountabilityin a fatal public transit crash, andexplored potential solutionsto a rise in pedestrian deaths, just to name a few examples. Which desk will I work on? Interns have worked on the following desks: Features, Politics, Metro, Emerging News, Visuals, Sports, Data and Audience Engagement. In addition, an intern is usually placed at The Capital Gazette in Annapolis. If you have a preference please indicate it on your application. How many stories am I expected to file? It depends on which desk you are on. Some desks, such as Emerging and Metro, tend to file more stories per week than others. What have interns done after working at The Sun? Some, such asTim Schwartz,Kiersten HackerandBridget Byrne,are currently working for the company. Others have gone on to news organizations near and far. What if I have a question that\u2019s not covered here?
