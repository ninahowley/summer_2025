Diablo Unified School District is dismissing the majority of an oversight committee appointed to supervise the spending of its $150 million taxpayer-funded construction bond program, even as anew grand jury reportcriticizes officials for failing to ensure the panel is truly independent \u2014 undermining California law. **Related Articles** It\u2019s expensive to become a teacher in California.

District officials brushed off those concerns, saying that most of the founding volunteers on theMeasure J Citizens\u2019 Bond Oversight Committeehad completed three full, two-year terms, which is the maximum service allowed under its bylaws. The six commissioners being dismissed have served since 2019. Melanie Koslow, executive director of maintenance, operations and facilities for school district, first broke the news in an 8 a.m. email to six commissioners on Friday, according to records reviewed by the Bay Area News Group. Not everyone being ousted is going quietly, including one commissioner who said his prediction of retaliatory dismissals is becoming a reality. Gina Haynes, a founding member of the oversight commission and its current chair, said Koslow and other district officials have told her to \u201cbury this thing,\u201d because their ongoing scrutiny of Measure J will negatively impact the school district\u2019s ability to seek voter approval for another bond. \u201cI don\u2019t think we should let things go,\u201d Haynes said on the phone Friday. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t sit well with me, because I want to do the right thing, not bury it.\u201d Haynes provided Koslow and Adrian Vargas, the district\u2019s chief business officer, records of her re-appointment in 2022, which aimed to stagger membership. By Tuesday, she said she\u2019s received the same answer about rules that effectively bind the district\u2019s decision. But Haynes said past bond oversight committees for the district have kept commissioners on the roster for years and even decades \u2014 a response to the challenge the body has had finding volunteers. \u201cEven the Board of Education, they\u2019re not familiar with all the past history \u2014 it takes people to know and pass that institutional knowledge on,\u201d Haynes said. \u201cIf we\u2019ve got people lined up to do this job, certainly I would step down after my term and let somebody else jump in, but we\u2019ve struggled to keep membership up. Mt. Diablo has struggled with transparency, and this is just another way to silence people.\u201d Superintendent Adam Clark was quick to defend his district in an interview Tuesday afternoon, saying staff are simply following the rules outlined the bylaws for the Measure J oversight commission, which were established during its first meeting in August of 2019. He said the oversight commission hadraised legitimate concerns with the Schneider Electric contract, but that as those issues have been addressed, their continued scrutiny is counter-productive and the criticism has \u201ctaken a lot away from the purpose of the work.\u201d Welcoming \u201cfresh eyes\u201d on the incoming roster, Clark said applications for new commissioners will be accepted in the coming months \u2014 likely after the district goes dark in July and Schneider\u2019s reps close the project out over summer break. AContra Costa County Civil Grand Jury reportreleased Tuesday morning found that the volunteer commission tasked with overseeing spending of the district\u2019s Measure J money is insufficiently independent. \u201cThe current CBOC is not independent as its bylaws are written and controlled by MDUSD. These bylaws give MDUSD the authority to control who is appointed as a member of the CBOC,\u201d the jury said in its report, which was filed May 30 and approved by the foreperson on June 4 \u2013 roughly 48 hours before the district\u2019s top maintenance and legal officials sent out notices that the board would soon have only two members. Jim Walsh, a founding commissioner, has for months criticized the district\u2019s failure to provide financial and legal resources the commission had requested to assist its investigation \u2013 saying the oversight body had been diminished to \u201can afterthought committee\u201d without any actual power to fulfill their legal duties. In October, he said he was concerned that the board may retaliate and remove oversight officials who voiced their opposition, which motivated him to raise thepossibility of a recall effort against the school district\u2019s trustees. The district\u2019s board will recognize the commission\u2019s six outgoing members at a meetingWednesdayfor their help in \u201censuring transparency, fiscal accountability, and community trust in the District\u2019s bond program. The purge leaves only twomembers remaining on the CBOC: Justin Pickering, who was appointed in December of 2022 to represent parents and guardians active in the PTO, and Erin Adrian, a parent/guardian of a student enrolled at MDUSD who was appointed in June 2024. Reflecting on his nearly six years volunteering to oversee spending of Measure J, Walsh said he believes district officials have been arrogant in their handling of the controversy around the Schneider Electric contract. \u201cAt the end of the day, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s about money, because they have the opportunity here to reclaim a large amount of this contract (with Schneider Electric),\u201d Walsh said. \u201cI think it\u2019s that they don\u2019t want the public to know about it. \u2026 They\u2019re unwilling to look at the facts and reality that these people put this over on them, and they want to cover it up.\u201d **Share this:** Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Facebook Click to share on Bluesky (Opens in new window)Bluesky Click to print (Opens in new window)Print Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window)Email Click to share on X (Opens in new window)X Report an error Policies and Standards Contact Us **RevContent Feed** **Most Popular** Federal agents take four into custody inside immigration court in Concord, witnesses sayFederal agents take four into custody inside immigration court in Concord, witnesses say **Federal agents take four into custody inside immigration court in Concord, witnesses say** **Federal agents take four into custody inside immigration court in Concord, witnesses say** State court upholds conviction of Moraga P.E. teacher who sexually abused student in 1990sState court upholds conviction of Moraga P.E. teacher who sexually abused student in 1990s **State court upholds conviction of Moraga P.E. teacher who sexually abused student in 1990s** **State court upholds conviction of Moraga P.E. teacher who sexually abused student in 1990s** After facing closure, East Bay hospitals revived with $77 million in state fundingAfter facing closure, East Bay hospitals revived with $77 million in state funding **After facing closure, East Bay hospitals revived with $77 million in state funding** **After facing closure, East Bay hospitals revived with $77 million in state funding** One killed, one injured in head-on Oakland traffic crashOne killed, one injured in head-on Oakland traffic crash **One killed, one injured in head-on Oakland traffic crash** **One killed, one injured in head-on Oakland traffic crash** Hundreds gather in San Jose, Oakland and San Francisco to protest ICEHundreds gather in San Jose, Oakland and San Francisco to protest ICE **Hundreds gather in San Jose, Oakland and San Francisco to protest ICE** **Hundreds gather in San Jose, Oakland and San Francisco to protest ICE** Gov.
