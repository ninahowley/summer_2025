Image: Connor McKenna/SiliconRepublic.com Start-ups and scale-ups from the midlands gathered in Mullingar for the sixth edition of the Founders Listening Tour. Monday (9 June) saw the midlands leg of the current Enterprise Ireland Founders Listening Tour take place at Irish Manufacturing Research (IMR) in Mullingar. The region\u2019s start-ups had the opportunity to give their feedback to Enterprise Ireland on the needs of the Irish ecosystem, particularly for those starting businesses in the region, and they got to hear from a special guest, Minister for Enterprise, Tourism and Employment Peter Burke, TD. This was the sixth edition of the tour that sees EI travel around Ireland to gather input and insights from founders. The aim is for the feedback gathered to help shape the roadmap for its newstrategy to support 1,000 new start-upsover the next five years. \u201cThis is a very critical part of our journey trying to improve and support the start-up space,\u201d said Minister Burke. \u201cIt\u2019s critical that people who have gone on that journey establishing their own business get all the support they can quickly, and what we want to do is really have a simpler, lighter, faster approach whereby we can get support into them at a key stage in that journey to ensure that they can be successful and realise their objectives. \u201cWe also are very clear that we want to realise that objective of having 1,000 new start-up companies over the next five years \u2013 which is a very significant target \u2013 and the employment that that brings and the increase in exports as well which will be critical for Enterprise Ireland\u2019s mission statement.\u201d The event began with a panel discussion where chair Ann O\u2019Dea and EI\u2019s Conor O\u2019Donovan were joined by two local founders. New Zealand-born Jenna Farrell is a co-founder of Scopey, an AI tool for subcontractors on fast-moving large projects who use WhatsApp to log voice and message notes.Scopey AIthen takes those voice notes and turns them into logged data and structured reports for the office. Having run a software agency in Melbourne, Australia, Farrell moved to Ireland three years ago where she founded Scopey which is run from Longford. \u201cI think it\u2019s great that Enterprise Ireland are asking for real feedback and they definitely got a lot of that today,\u201d she said. \u201cEnterprise Ireland has been a really great support for us from the beginning but, like every company and organisation, there\u2019s lots of improvements that can be made.\u201d Mark Gibbons is CEO and co-founder ofTapitag, a software development company based in Athlone, shipping out to 87 countries globally with more than 50,000 users on its platform, that specialises in digital business cards, review management, gamified donations and proximity marketing. It boasts clients such as Airbus, UEFA, Chelsea Football Club and IDA Ireland. \u201cI thought it was really, really beneficial to be here and to get our points across of what we think would help our companies. And it was lovely to see that we weren\u2019t on our own in terms of some of the stuff we discussed,\u201d Gibbons said. \u201cI\u2019m absolutely delighted to welcome the community here today, all the founders and Enterprise Ireland, and to have the conversation about what are the support structures that they need to help them and support them as businesses to grow,\u201d said Barry Kennedy, CEO of Irish Manufacturing Research. \u201cIt was a full house here in Mullingar at IMR,\u201d said O\u2019Donovan. \u201cWe heard a lot around how can we be a little bit more digital in terms of making the supports that are available for start-ups across the Government ecosystem more accessible, how using digital tools, using AI could speed that up. And speed came up a lot. How can we really ensure that we\u2019re keeping up, that we\u2019re being fast enough in terms of delivery of services to support entrepreneurs as they chase the next big opportunity.\u201d The regional leg of the tour finished up yesterday, with a well-attended north-west edition. Watch out for our report from Letterkenny on Friday (13 June). The tour finishes with a stakeholder event in Dublin later this month. As the tour can only reach a representative sample of start-ups and founders, Enterprise Ireland welcomes feedback from interested founders and start-ups via theFounders Listening Tour survey here,before the end of June.
