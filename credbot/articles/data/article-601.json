Photo:Paulo Pinto/Ag\u00eancia Brasil, used with permission At a press conference on June 3, 2025, Brazil\u2019s president,Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silvawasasked by a journalistto comment on astatement by the Israeli Embassyin the country, which claimed the nationalist Palestinian groupHamaslies about the current situation in Gaza\u2018\u2018to feed antisemitism around the world.\u201dThe statement was released after Lula called what is happening in the regiona genocide. Answering the question,he reinforcedthisposition: Vem dizer que \u00e9 antissemitismo? Precisa parar com esse vitimismo e saber o seguinte: o que est\u00e1 acontecendo na Faixa de Gaza \u00e9 um genoc\u00eddio. \u00c9 a morte de mulheres e crian\u00e7as que n\u00e3o est\u00e3o participando de guerra. \u00c9 a decis\u00e3o de um governo que nem o povo judeu quer. N\u00e3o d\u00e1 para, como ser humano, n\u00e3o \u00e9 nem como presidente do Brasil, mas como ser humano, aceitar isso como se fosse uma guerra normal. They come and say it is antisemitism? They need to stop playing the victim and know the following: what is happening in Gaza is a genocide. It\u2019s the death of women and children who are not part of the war. It\u2019s a government\u2019s decision that not even the Jewish people want. I cannot, as a human being, not even as Brazil\u2019s president, but as a human being, accept it as a normal war. Lula\u2019s criticism over the war in Gaza, following Hamas\u2019 attacks of October 7, 2023, is not new. Alongside Chile\u2019s Gabriel Boric, he has been an outspoken critic of the actions taken byBenjamin Netanyahu\u2019s government since the early days of the conflict, a position that is not unanimous among their neighbors in theSouthern Coneand that helps to brew narratives of political polarization in the region. For instance, Lula\u2019s predecessor,Jair Bolsonaro, a close ally of Netanyahu when he was in office, wasinvited to visit Israelin 2024, a few days after Lula was declared\u2018\u2018persona non grata\u201dfor his criticism. Underinvestigation for attempting a coupd\u2019\u00e9tat, however, Bolsonaro\u2019spassport is currently being retainedby the authorities. Check out how the region\u2019s countries are positioned on the war in Gaza: In 2010, during Lula's second term as president,Brazil recognizedthe Palestinian state with the borders establishedup to 1967. It became one of the first Latin American countries to do so. While criticizing what happens in Gaza now,saying\u2018\u2018It is not a war, but an army killing women and children,\u201dhe kept standing for a two-state solution. The government also approached the matter officially, on June 1, when itpublished a statementagainst the creation of 22 new settlements on the West Bank, announced by Israel a few days before: O Brasil repudia as recorrentes medidas unilaterais tomadas pelo governo israelense, que, ao imporem situa\u00e7\u00e3o equivalente a anexa\u00e7\u00e3o do territ\u00f3rio palestino ocupado, comprometem a implementa\u00e7\u00e3o da solu\u00e7\u00e3o de dois Estados. Reafirma, ainda, seu hist\u00f3rico compromisso com um Estado da Palestina independente e vi\u00e1vel, convivendo em paz e seguran\u00e7a ao lado de Israel, nas fronteiras de 1967, incluindo a Cisjord\u00e2nia e a Faixa de Gaza, com capital em Jerusal\u00e9m Oriental. Brazil repudiates the recurring one-sided measures taken by the Israeli government, which, by imposing a situation equivalent to the annexation of the occupied Palestinian territories, compromises the implementation of a two-state solution. Brazil also reaffirms its historical commitment to an independent and viable Palestinian State, living in peace and safety alongside Israel, within the 1967 borders, including the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, having Eastern Jerusalem as its capital. The organization Conib (Brazil\u2019s Israelite Confederation)statedthat the president was once again attacking Jewish people and risking their safety. PresidentGabriel Boric, like Lula, has been an outspoken critic of Israel\u2019s war on Gaza. On June 1, during hisannual address, he also classified the Israeli government as\u2018\u2018genocidal\u201d andsaidhe would send a bill to the Legislature toban any importsfrom Israeli-occupied territories: Considerando la permanente violaci\u00f3n del derecho internacional por parte de Israel, mediante asentamientos ilegales en territorio palestino, y el reciente anuncio de expansi\u00f3n de esta pol\u00edtica, he decidido que es de toda justicia patrocinar y poner urgencia al proyecto de ley que proh\u00edbe la importaci\u00f3n de productos producidos en territorios ilegalmente ocupados. Considering the ongoing violation of international law by Israel's government, regarding illegal settlements in the Palestinian territory, and their recent announcement about expanding this policy, I've decided that is fair to sponsor, and ask urgently, for a bill forbidding the import of products from illegally occupied territories. Boric also said hedemanded that his defence minister draw a planso they can stop depending on Israeli industry in other sectors. AsReutersreports, the Chilean president recently\u2018\u2018recalled military personnel from Chile\u2019s embassy in the country and summoned the ambassador for questioning.\u201d On May 15, 2025, hundreds of people marched in Montevideo, Uruguay\u2019s capital, commemorating the anniversary of theNakba\u2014 adatethat marks the violent displacement of Palestinians from their land. Besides calling for an end to the war, protesters demanded that PresidentYamand\u00fa Orsi\u2019s new government cease its relations with Israel, reportsnewspaper La Diaria. A few days later, on May 19, the Defense Minister, Sandra Lazo, met with the Israeli ambassador, Michal Hershkovitz. The meeting was made public by the Israeli representativeon social media, while Lazosaidshe decided not to take the protocol picture alongside Hershkovitz, knowing it could \u2018\u2018hurt feelings.\u201d Shealso claimedto have reinforced that Uruguay recognized the Palestinian State\u2019s independence since 2011, and does not agree with this \u2018\u2018completely asymmetrical conflict.\u201d Orsi\u2019s left-wing political coalition,Frente Amplio (FA, Broad Front), through its executive secretariat,issued a resolutionon June 3, calling for support for actions defending the human rights of the Palestinian people.Thedocument says: Estas acciones comprender\u00e1n la movilizaci\u00f3n articulada con organizaciones sociales, culturales y de derechos humanos (\u2026) y todas aquellas que de forma pac\u00edfica y organizada contribuyan a respaldar a nuestro gobierno nacional en la toma de medidas que aboguen por el fin de la masacre, el ingreso de ayuda humanitaria sin restricciones, el respeto de los Derechos Humanos. These actions will encompass the articulated mobilization with social, cultural and human rights organizations (\u2026) and all those that, in a pacific and organized way, contribute to support our national government in all their measures advocating for the end of the massacre, the entering of humanitarian aid without restriction, the respect for human rights. The stand also drew criticism from the opposition, such as the Colorado party, whichissuedtheir own statement saying FA\u2019s stance could promote hate and the demonization of Israel and the Jewish people. The Blanco party, also in opposition,statedthat Israel had a right to self-defense, while calling for respect for humanitarian principles to prevent harming people not involved in the conflict. Orsi himselfsaid on June 5that the statement came from a political force, \u2018\u2018and that the government is something else.\u201d He also told journalists that the people in Gaza need more than announcements, and he plans to send them powder, milk and rice, among other products. Javier Milei, the ultra libertarian Argentine president, is the most vocalsupporterof Israel in the region. TheNY Times calledhim \u2018\u2018a Catholic president who consults with a rabbi,\u201d pointing out that his devotion to the Jewish faith influences his national politics. Last July, Milei\u2019s cabinetissued an official statementdeclaring Hamas an \u2018\u2018international terrorist organization\u201d: El Presidente Javier Milei tiene el compromiso inquebrantable de reconocer a los terroristas por lo que son. Es la primera vez que existe voluntad pol\u00edtica de hacerlo. President Javier Milei has the unbreakable commitment to acknowledge terrorists for what they are. This is the first time that there is a political willingness to do it so. The support for Israel recently granted Mileithe Genesis award, the \u2018\u2018Jewish Nobel Prize,\u201d whichis worth 1 million US dollars. As reported byAP news, the organizers of the award explained their decision as an appreciation of\u2018\u2018Milei for reversing Argentina\u2019s long history of anti-Israel votes at the United Nations, designating the Hamas and Hezbollah militant groups as terrorist organizations and reopening investigations into the bombings of Jewish and Israeli targets in Argentina in the 1990s.\u201d Last year, in an interview withBen Shapiroon his YouTube channel, Milei said: Es muy importante entender el v\u00ednculo de la libertad con Israel. Es fundamental porque es un pueblo que adem\u00e1s ha logrado la conjunci\u00f3n entre lo espiritual y lo material. Y esa armon\u00eda espiritual y material genera progreso. It\u2019s important to understand the freedom bond with Israel. It\u2019s fundamental, because it\u2019s a people that has achieved the conjunction between the spiritual and the material. And this spiritual and material harmony generates progress. Last December, the country re-opened its embassy in Jerusalem, acknowledging the city as Israel\u2019s capital, and was the first country to do so since the Hamas attacks on October 7, 2023. According toAP news, the move by President Santiago Pe\u00f1a, whoattended the embassy reopeningin person, was\u2018\u2018a rare diplomatic victory\u2019\u2019 for Israel. As reported byReuters, Pe\u00f1a didn\u2019t mention the war in Gaza on that occasion, but declared:\u2018\u2018This step symbolizes our commitment to shared values and the strengthening of the ties that build a future of peace, development and mutual understanding.\u201d Previously, the Paraguayan embassy had been located in Tel Aviv, and went through back-and-forth changes since 2018, amid shifts in government, as also reportedby the news agency. This May, the Israeli foreign relations minister, Gideon Sa\u2019ar,calledthe gesture\u2018\u2018friendship in the harshest moment\u2019\u2019 for his country. **Categories** Latin America West Asia & North Africa Argentina Brazil Chile Israel Palestine Paraguay Uruguay Human Rights Humanitarian Response International Relations Politics War & Conflict A region on the brink: The global implications of the war on Gaza Israel's war on Gaza **Support our work** Global Voicesstands out as one of the earliest and strongest examples of how media committed to building community and defending human rights can positively influence how people experience events happening beyond their own communities and national borders.
