McCoy explores America\u2019s rise as a world power\u2014from the 1890s through the Cold War\u2014and its bid to extend its hegemony deep into the twenty-first century through a fusion of cyberwar, space warfare, trade pacts, and military alliances. McCoy then analyzes the marquee instruments of US hegemony\u2014covert intervention, client elites, psychological torture, and worldwide surveillance. Peeling back layers of secrecy, McCoy exposes a military and economic battle for global domination fought in the shadows, largely unknown to those outside the highest rungs of power. Can the United States extend the \u201cAmerican Century\u201d or will China guide the globe for the next hundred years? McCoy devotes his final chapter to these questions, boldly laying out a series of scenarios that could lead to the end of Washington\u2019s world domination by 2030. Alfred W.

Whether or not one is a believer in American power, the case that Alfred McCoy makes\u2014that much of America\u2019s decline is due to its own contradictions and failures\u2014is a sad one. He provides a glimmer of hope that America can ease into the role of a more generous, more collaborative, if less powerful, world player. Let\u2019s hope that Americans will listen to his powerful arguments.\u201d \u201c[A] brilliant and deeply informed must-read for anyone seriously interested in geopolitics, the history of Empire, and the shape of the future.\u201d \u201cWhat is the character of this American empire?\u201d Alfred McCoy asks at the outset of this provocative study. His answer not only limns the contours of the American imperium as it evolved during the twentieth century, but explains why its days are quite likely numbered. This is history with profound relevance to events that are unfolding before our eyes.\u201d \u201cAlfred McCoy offers a meticulous, eye-opening account of the rise, since 1945, and impending premature demise of the American Century of world domination. As the empire\u2019s political, economic, and military strategies unravel under cover of secrecy, America\u2019s neglected citizens would do well to read this book.\u201d \u201cSobering reading for geopolitics mavens and Risk aficionados alike\u2026\u201d \u201cMcCoy\u2019s detailed, panoramic analysis of the past, present, and future of the American empire covers all spheres of activity including not just land, sea, air, space, and cyberspace, but also the netherworld of covert operations \u2014 and seasons all of this with some fascinating personal vignettes. His new book,In The Shadows of the American Century, joins the essential short list of scrupulous historical and comparative studies of the United States as an awesome, conflicted, technologically innovative, routinely atrocious, and ultimately hubristic imperial power.\u201d \u201cOne of our best and most underappreciated historians takes a hard look at the truth of our empire, both its covert activities and the reasons for its impending decline.\u201d \u201cIn the Shadows of the American Centuryis a valuable contribution to geopolitical discourse that draws important lessons from history.\u201d \u201cMcCoy\u2019s latest book,In the Shadow of the American Century: The Rise and Decline of U.S. Global Power, provides an autopsy on a dying empire, which has squandered its moral capital by promoting wide-scale torture and mass surveillance\u2026.The end of empire scenarios relayed by McCoy in dark terms could in turn provide positive opportunities for societal change as the necessity for constant war is removed.\u201d **Newsletter** **Recent Articles** Freedom of Movement and Global ApartheidJune 10, 2025 Is Nuclear Winter a Climate Issue?June 8, 2025 A World Without iPhones?June 5, 2025 The War on Trans PeopleJune 3, 2025 Upside-Down WorldJune 1, 2025 Home Archive Authors Books About Contact Donate Privacy Policy Terms of Service Facebook Twitter Reddit RSS Feed"}
