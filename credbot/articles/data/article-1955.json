The programme aimed to enhance the international competitiveness of Georgian SMEs \u2013 particularly in the fashion, kidswear, and leather sectors \u2013 by providing them with the tools, mentorship, and direct market access needed to expand into European markets. Out of 58 SMEs admitted into the programme in September 2024, 51 companies successfully completed the entire course of activities. Over the course of seven months, participants engaged in eight training workshops \u2013 three held in person in Tbilisi and five delivered online \u2013 focusing on export readiness, brand positioning, international marketing, and negotiation strategies. Participants also benefited from two tailored mentorship sessions with industry experts from Estonia and the United Kingdom. The first session took place in person in Tbilisi, while the second followed several months later online, allowing companies to reflect on progress, receive feedback, and plan next steps for international growth. A key component of the programme was the direct participation of Georgian fashion brands in international trade fairs, including Playtime Paris and MICAM & MIPEL Milano. At these events, the Visionest Institute provided on-site guidance and immediate mentorship, supporting participants in real-time interactions with buyers, agents, and partners \u2013 offering practical insights that proved crucial to their performance and networking outcomes. The graduation ceremony in Tbilisi comprised two distinct segments. The first was a Post-Evaluation Workshop, led by Visionest Institute\u2019s CEO, Anu-Mall Naarits. The workshop provided a reflective space to assess the programme\u2019s outcomes and share experiences. Company representatives from COSMO and Nini Patsatsia offered testimonials about their journey through the programme, highlighting the value of personalised mentorship and the opportunities presented at international trade fairs. \u201cThis year, through the Visionest Institute\u2019s EU-supported trade fair assistance programme, COSMO had the chance to join some of Europe\u2019s most influential trade events. With hands-on guidance from Anu-Mall Naarits and Jaan J\u00e4rv, we learned how to better present our brand, tailor our message, and build valuable relationships. \u201cThe mentorship we received \u2013 from strategic advice to booth presentation \u2013 was a game-changer. Participating in events like MIPEL Milan reaffirmed one powerful truth: growth doesn\u2019t always come in the form of immediate orders. Often, it comes from learning, networking, exchanging ideas, and getting inspired. Every trade fair gives us the chance to reflect, adjust, and return stronger,\u201d said Giorgi Kochlamazashvili of COSMO. \u201cIn my first MICAM experience, I had the passion and a strong product. But I lacked critical elements: a structured price list, clearly prepared product information, and the know-how to speak with buyers in a professional and convincing way. This year, everything changed. I came with all materials professionally prepared, including price lists, visuals, and pre-defined discount structures for agents, boutiques, and distributors. This kind of professionalism builds immediate trust and makes a strong first impression. \u201cOne of the most important lessons I learned through the programme was how to see things from the buyer\u2019s perspective. Understanding their priorities and being able to clearly explain why my product ts their market made a significant difference. I also made follow-ups a priority \u2013 and saw immediate results,\u201d added Nini Patsatsia. The second part of the day was the Graduation Ceremony. Following the workshop, a formal ceremony was held to honour the achievements of the participants. A total of 99 individuals received certificates of successful completion in recognition of their commitment and development. \u201cOn the first day of our training programme in Georgia, we asked the participants what could make Georgia stand out in the world. The answer came quickly \u2013 creativity, said the companies from the fashion and design sectors. From that moment on, we moved forward step by step together, showing the opportunities for international cooperation and how to present oneself professionally at top European trade fairs, build relationships, and achieve sales deals. \u201cWe delved into the participants\u2019 business ideas and creativity, with mentors actively contributing to find ways to accelerate their growth. We helped them set a clear focus and introduced them to key success factors in international business. We were positively surprised at how quickly the participants began to adapt their mindset and experiment with new approaches. Even more \u2013 from an initially individualistic mindset grew a spirit of sharing and collaboration that carried throughout the entire programme. \u201cEveryone pushed through to the end to earn their international certificate, which demonstrated their commitment and professionalism. We\u2019re now moving towards the next steps of development and are sincerely grateful to all participants, partners, funders, and mentors \u2013 it is thanks to you that this programme is possible, said Anu-Mall Naarits, Visionest Institute\u2019s CEO. Anu-Mall Naarits, Visionest CEO The successful conclusion of the Trade Fair Assistance for SMEs in Georgia programme highlights the power of combining structured training, tailored mentorship, and real-world exposure to support the growth of local businesses. As Georgia\u2019s SMEs continue to explore new international markets, the Visionest Institute remains committed to supporting their journeys with innovative, high-impact programs rooted in collaboration, capacity building, and sustainability.
