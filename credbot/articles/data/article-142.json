At the event, Federal Capital Territory Minister Nyesom Wike announced renaming the Centre, which opened in 1991, as the Bola Ahmed Tinubu International Conference Centre. Recalling his previous visit to the Centre during the 2024 ECOWAS Parliament conference, President Tinubu recounted his shock at its poor state. \u201cWhen I attended the ECOWAS Parliament conference, the environment was dirty, disorganised, and uninhabitable. I turned to Mr. Wike and said, \u2018This Conference Centre does not reflect who we are. Have we sunk this low?\u2019 He replied, \u2018No, bear with us. We will do whatever we can to transform the place.\u2019 Today, I am very happy. \u201cThe International Conference Centre is part of our country\u2019s larger vision to become a hub for regional diplomacy, continental trade discussions, global partnerships, and other thoughtful, well-outlined goals that reflect our \u2018Nigeria First\u2019 principle,\u201d President Tinubu said. He praised Julius Berger Nigeria Plc, the original contractor for delivering a high-quality renovation, adding that the quality reflects what Julius Berger has been known for in this country for years. Under the Renewed Hope Agenda, President Tinubu further assured Nigerians of his administration\u2019s determination to revitalise infrastructure across key sectors, including transportation, healthcare, education, energy, and urban development. He commended the minister for completing the renovation within one year of the Centre\u2019s closure. Applauding Wike for his vision and execution, President Tinubu said: \u201cDo not pay attention to the busybodies and bystanders. Whatever they say, continue your good work. You are a transformational leader with foresight, vision, and determination.\u201d Also speaking at the event, Senate President Godswill Akpabio commended the FCT Administration for naming halls at the Centre after Senate President, Speaker House of Representatives, and the Chief Justice of Nigeria. He lauded the collaborative spirit between the executive, legislature, and judiciary under President Tinubu\u2019s leadership. Wike said the FCT transformed the facility within eight months after the president\u2019s directive. \u201cMr. President, this transformation would not have been possible without your leadership. Many presidents have come here, but none said this was not what Nigeria needed because they lacked your courage and vision,\u201d he said. Wike stressed the need for financial discipline in maintaining the newly upgraded facility. \u201cWhether you are a ministry or an agency, you must pay something to use this facility. That is the only way we can sustain it. No such thing as \u2018my brother\u2019 or \u2018my sister\u2019 wants to use it for a wedding. If you want to use a beautiful place like this, you must pay something,\u201d he said. The Bola Ahmed Tinubu International Conference Centre is among several capital projects scheduled for commissioning by President Tinubu in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) as part of activities marking his second anniversary in office. The FCT Administration is implementing the projects under Barrister Wike\u2019s leadership. **Post navigation** **Trending** Abuja International Conference Centre: Tinubu hails Julius Berger\u2019s quality work deliveryJune 11, 2025 Peter Obi, Otti reason for Labour Party crisis \u2013 FactionJune 11, 2025 2025 Anambra governorship election: Soludo, others to pay N50m on advert as campaign kicks offJune 11, 2025 Air Peace \u2018extortion drive\u2019: My story \u2013 OshiomholeJune 11, 2025 Uba Sani reads riot act to criminal gangs in KadunaJune 11, 2025 NIS: Shaibu assumes duty as DG, meets Dikko, othersJune 11, 2025 FCT coaches: NFCA chapter set to stage electionJune 11, 2025 Osayi-Samuel agrees move to Turkish Club BesiktasJune 11, 2025 CDS Democracy Day Basketball: 16 teams, academies jostle for honours in AbujaJune 11, 2025 June 12: Collaborate with progressives to deepen democracy, Afenifere tells CSOsJune 11, 2025 CUPP urges Tinubu to focus on healthcare, education, othersJune 11, 2025 8th Assembly: Enugu lawmakers pass 23 executive bills, 14 motionsJune 11, 2025 2027: Northern Yoruba group vows to give 10m votes to TinubuJune 11, 2025 June 12: UNYF urges electoral reforms for national developmentJune 11, 2025 FCCPC inaugurates joint market monitoring taskforce in 4 FCT marketsJune 11, 2025 BBNJ: Nigeria wants increased funding for blue economy initiativesJune 11, 2025 NRC affirms safety of rail tracks on Warri-Itakpe corridorJune 11, 2025 FG moves to be self-sufficient in sugar productionJune 11, 2025 TotalEnergies profit plunges 93% in Q1 2025June 11, 2025 NDIC begins payment of liquidation dividends to Premier Commercial Bank creditorsJune 11, 2025 Dangote Cement opens N100bn commercial papers for subscriptionJune 11, 2025 World Bank maintains Nigeria\u2019s economic growth outlook at 3.6%June 11, 2025 First China bishop appointed under Pope LeoJune 11, 2025 June 12: Tinubu cancels broadcast, to address National Assembly on Democracy DayJune 11, 2025 SEC speaks on \u2018CBEX resuming operation in Nigeria\u2019June 11, 2025 Ehije Ukaki: Sheffield United sign Nigeria\u2019s wingerJune 11, 2025 Immigration rule: Protests spread across US despite Trump threatsJune 11, 2025 Ponzi: CBEX remains banned in Nigeria, SEC warns investorsJune 11, 2025 Fire guts filling station in LagosJune 11, 2025 5-man US team in Nigeria for Lagos int\u2019l airport evaluationJune 11, 2025 **Opinion** **Column** Blueprint Newspapersis a Nigerian daily print newspaper founded and published in Abuja,Nigeria.
