START HERE Free Book SHOP VIP Patreon **THE DARK PATH: Conspiracy Theories of Illuminati and Occult Symbolism in Pop Culture, the New Age Alien Agenda & Satanic Transhumanism** September 9, 2017Isaac Weishaupt I\u2019ve been talking about it for months; and NOW is the time to read the most revealing effort to understand the Luciferian ways of the occult! THE DARK PATH is a comprehensive guide to decoding the \u201cIlluminati\u201d agenda of instilling occultism into the masses through entertainment. Months ago I asked YOU what topics you were interested in learning more about, and this book addresses the esoteric themes of music, film, and television. It also details the demonic deception behind the alien agenda, a concept of great importance to the hidden hand of the Illuminati. It\u2019s all here; find the light down THE DARK PATH\u2026 THE DARK PATH is considered Isaac Weishaupt\u2019s magnum opus; a result of many years delving into the recesses of occult dogma from the approach of open-minded rationalism. Isaac\u2019s journey started with an attempt to separate religion from conspiracy theories, but the agenda clearly showed a connection. The question to be considered is if the agenda of the \u201cIlluminati\u201d overlaps with the tenets of the \u201coccult,\u201d and whether or not there is an \u201cevil\u201d influence at play\u2026 Using cited references to occult literature from the likes of Aleister Crowley, Helena Blavatsky, Kenneth Grant, Jack Parsons and Alice Bailey; Isaac provides a fundamental exploration of the occult belief system and alternate version of history. Utilizing familiar examples from pop culture, film, music, and television; Isaac proves the \u201cIlluminati\u201d agenda to steer humanity down a path of Luciferianism by inserting symbolism that speaks to, and manipulates, our subconscious minds. Demonstrations of occult symbols, predictive programming, and ritual magick concepts will be evident as the reader sees the connections made between Disney, The Beatles, Star Wars, Rihanna, Led Zeppelin, Jay-Z, Katy Perry, HBO\u2019s Westworld, Harry Potter, The Rocky Horror Picture Show, the Alien films, Batman, Ancient Aliens, comic book super heroes, and many more! This work carves out a distinction between witches, satanists, magicians, occultists and the New Age, while proving the connected desires to usher in Crowley\u2019s Aeon of Horus as the New World Order. Using concepts from Gnosticism, Freemasonry, Alchemy, Kabbalah, and ceremonial magick; Isaac explains Hermetic axioms such as \u201cAs above, so below\u201d from which many occultists subscribe to mental emanations that can be used to create reality. They are all part of the Evolution of Consciousness that is being used to push mankind down the path of obliteration through transhumanism, which promises the alchemical pursuit of immortality. NASA, Adolf Hitler\u2019s Nazis, and Ancient Alien theorists are using Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution to assert the superiority of alien life forms. A coordinated effort of science-fiction beliefs is being conducted to put us in direct contact with these demonic deceptions. The unsuspecting masses will be shocked to find out the \u201cIlluminati\u201d savior of Lucifer and his desire to put us into the transhuman digital matrix; ultimately destroying God\u2019s creation by \u201cevolving\u201d us into the next entity: a globally connected digital form of consciousness. Isaac shares personal tales of Faustian bargains as well as experiences with radio shows that helped confirm his world view of the frequency battle for our souls; and this book is a testament to those observations. \u201cThe religion of the ancients is the religion of the future.\u201d -Helena Blavatsky **** To pick this book up you\u2019ve got several options (I aim to please so I\u2019ve put them on a variety of distribution points): **1.
