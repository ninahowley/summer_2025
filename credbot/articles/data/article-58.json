Officials with the Harrison County Sheriff\u2019s Office also located the mother, who was found deceased from an apparent suicide. Timeline of events: On December 21, 1993, a newborn was found deceased in 1993 near the Lorraine Road exit on I-10 in Gulfport, Mississippi. An autopsy at the time determined the cause of death to be blood loss and exposure, ruling the case as a homicide. Despite an extensive investigation, authorities were unable to locate the mother of the baby, who was given the name \u201cMary Josephine,\u201d and the case went cold. In December 2023, officials exhumed Mary Josephine\u2019s body to obtain DNA for forensic analysis. On October 10, 2024, investigators received DNA results identifying potential family members. Through subsequent interviews, they pinpointed a woman believed to be Mary Josephine\u2019s mother. A search warrant was obtained for DNA comparison. On October 11, 2024, investigators attempted to contact the woman at her home in Gautier, Mississippi, where they found her deceased from an apparent suicide. Inside her residence, a letter was discovered in which the woman claimed to be Mary Josephine\u2019s mother. On Monday, Harrison County Sheriff Matt Haley announced the identification of baby Mary Josephine, a newborn found deceased in 1993 near the Lorraine Road exit on I-10 in Gulfport, Mississippi. **You Might Like** **Movies and TV shows casting in Huntsville** **Movies and TV shows casting in Huntsville** News Sports Culture Small Business Submit a news tip Submit a photo About Us Terms of Service"}
