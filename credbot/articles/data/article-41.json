Share Options Share a link too this article Copy LinkCopy Link Email Facebook LinkedIn X It is one vainglorious outrage after another in this White House. If you write about some dumbfounding scandal in the morning, another is fairly likely to arise by the afternoon. That\u2019s the idea, of course: President Trump is trying to wear everyone out, to overload us, to atomize our attention. So, let\u2019s slow down for a moment \u2026 and focus. This weekend, instead of charging taxpayersmillions for yet another golf outing, Trump is instead charging taxpayers tens of millions to throw himself a military birthday parade. **Steno\u2019s AI Tool Steps Ahead Of The Pack** Transcript Genius is a \u2018very well-behaved\u2019 partner. ThisSaturday, June 14, dozens of military aircraft, hundreds of armored vehicles, and thousands of U.S. troops will descend upon Washington, D.C., to take part in a parade. Sycophantic feds have been parroting the lie that the parade is to honor the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Army, though we all really know it is to stroke Donald Trump\u2019s ego on his 79th birthday. There were no plans for such a military parade before Trump personally intervened weeks ago in the planning of the celebration of the Army\u2019s 250th year. Like when Trump\u2019s favorite former weekend Fox News hostrestored the name of \u201cFort Bragg\u201d from \u201cFort Liberty\u201dby finding some random brave soldier who happened to be named \u201cBragg\u201d and then pretended it was a coincidence that he shared a last name with the camp\u2019s former namesake, Confederate monster Braxton Bragg, the official fig leaf is fooling no one. The Army estimates this75-minutebirthday paradewill cost taxpayers $25 million to $45 million. Since the military quite famouslyspends way more than it thinks it is going toon almost everything, I wouldn\u2019t put too much stock in that already vague estimate. Trumpassures us that the cost will be\u201c[p]eanuts compared to the value of doing it,\u201d much ashe assured us that\u201cMexico is paying for the wall\u201d that Mexico did not actually pay one penny for. To be clear, there is no value to be gained by needlessly tearing up the streets of the nation\u2019s capital as a bunch of 60-ton Abrams tanksthat get 0.6 mpgroll over them. **How Strong Is Your Firm\u2019s Financial Visibility?** Discover how to gain more control over your firm\u2019s finances and unlock smarter growth strategies\u2014take a quick financial visibility quiz designed for law firms. I am far from the first to point out that military parades on leaders\u2019 birthdays arefar more common in weak foreign dictatorshipsthan in strong western democracies. Strong nations have not found blocks of marching soldiers to be intimidating for quite a long time. Meanwhile, in Ukraine, where our allies are actually bravely fighting a brutal war in defense of democracy rather than putting on war-themed street theater, the Trump administration continues to jerk U.S. support. Most recently, Trump\u2019s defense secretaryredirected 20,000 specialized anti-drone weaponsthat the U.S. had already promised Ukraine to the Middle East instead. Canada continues to step up to help fill the void created by the Trump administration. Instead of pointlessly driving military equipment around Ottawa, this June our neighbor to the north is sending$22 million worth of its Bison and Coyote armored vehiclesto Ukraine to be used against the Russian invaders. It is a drop in the bucket compared to the billions in aid Canada and other countries have already pledged to Ukraine, yet it\u2019s a notable one considering how American taxpayers are spending a similar amount on armored vehicles this weekend. What do you think makes a nation look stronger on the global stage: showing the world it has plenty of advanced military equipment to spare when the time comes to assist an ally in desperate need, or using tens of millions to shatter the pavement of its own capital city so that its president can feel like a big shot on his birthday? President Theodore Roosevelt, a real patriot, a combat veteran, and deservedwinner of the Nobel Peace Prize, popularized and applied to his foreign policywhat he believed was a West African proverb: \u201cSpeak softly and carry a big stick.\u201d Trump\u2019s foreign policy, on the other hand, as exemplified by his birthday military parade, could be better characterized as, \u201cSpeak loudly but carry a limp dick.\u201d Enjoy your parade, MAGA.
