proposing an early framework for a mental health intervention calleddepsychiatrization. Depsychiatrization describes the processes by which a diagnosed individual learns to expel psychiatrically induced self-concepts and substitute them for more empowering and nurturing understandings. These processes are not, in themselves, entirely novel, as they have been a part of many alternative movements throughout time. It is the ambition behind this proposal to formalize a way of helping and supporting people who would benefit from depsychiatrization, as well as supplying a legitimizing platform to stand on for those who wish to encourage growth without pathology. Much has been written on the many ways in which psychiatry does harm to individuals seeking help for mental health issues: The medical treatments are far too often more harmful than beneficial, especially in the long run. The symptom-focused therapeutic treatments rarely produce sustainable outcomes leading to better lives. For instance, electroshock therapy is a disputed method at best, a harmful, medieval practice at worst. Yet we too rarely discuss the harm that psychiatric treatment does to a person\u2019s self-concept and self-narrative. One of the purported positive effects of psychiatric diagnoses is the relief a person may feel when an expert tells them how and why they suffer. And this is sometimes true, at least in the short run. But what happens later, when the psychiatric diagnosis is ingrained in a person\u2019s understanding of themself? What does it mean for an individual to perceive of themself as pathologically disordered in the mind? It is my contention that self-concepts stemming from psychiatric diagnoses do far more harm than good. The detrimental effects of learning to think of yourself in terms of mind-pathology affect all areas of life, including employment, relationships, parenthood, finances, self-worth, and the list goes on endlessly. The purpose of depsychiatrization is to remedy this harm. Depsychiatrization was not a method I developed intentionally. Rather, it originated as a byproduct of helping clients in therapy who had been dehumanized and gaslighted into thinking of themselves as disordered or sick. Being a public critical voice, I do tend to see many clients who\u2019ve suffered at the hands of psychiatry, and in helping them I found the process of shedding psychiatrically induced ideas to be intertwined with the process of healing. Maybe the best way to explain the relevance of this novel concept is with illustrative cases. And none better to start with than the diagnoses labeledpersonality disorders. They comprise a group of diagnoses that do catastrophic damage to the person who is taught to identify with them. I was employed for two years in the Danish psychiatric system in an outpatient clinic treating people diagnosed with so-called personality disorders. In my two years of regrettable service I did not find anyone whose personality seemed to be disordered (whatever that means). The longer I spoke to my patients, the less sense their diagnoses made, and the more I came to understand their feelings and reactions as sensical and normal. I did not find any person whose personality seemed pathological. What I did find, however, was an abundance of traumatized, marginalized, discriminated, isolated, and oppressed people. Names and details have been anonymized in the following case-presentations. One of them, Lea, was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. I was assigned as Lea\u2019s therapist, and my official goal was to alleviate her of as many of her borderline symptoms as possible, and to educate her on mentalization and the ramification of her disordered personality. I opted instead to try to understand Lea. She did feel the diagnosis was a fit at first: She definitely wound up in many conflicts, she felt an emptiness inside, she did tend to feel abandoned and therefore preemptively reject others, but at the same time she felt a strong need for closeness, she did engage in frequent casual sex with men, she did engage in self-harmful practices. The diagnostic criteria seemed to fit the behavior. During the course of our year-and-a-half of therapy, we explored the many impacts that had shaped Lea\u2019s so-called \u2018symptoms\u2019. Her mother had always told her that she\u2019d inherited her troubled mind. Her father abandoned her when she was little. She\u2019d been bullied a lot growing up and had learnt to compensate by making herself hard and confrontational. This side of her existed in conflict with a strongly empathetic side of her. The more we learned about Lea\u2019s past and how she\u2019d coped with instability and abuse, the more her present behavioral patterns made sense. And the more her patterns made sense, the better equipped we were to engage those parts of her that were in conflict within her. Lea did not want to bea badass border-bitch(her words, not mine) anymore. She wanted to feel feminine without feeling weak, and masculine without acting violently aggressively. She wanted to have friendships that were bidirectional, and not just about constantly putting out fires. And she wanted to experience love, actual love, where she\u2019d dare let someone see those parts of her that she hid from other people. Those were the parts that we spent the most time engaging with in therapy. It took about a year\u2019s time to lay the foundation for fundamental change towards these goals. One day as we sat quietly and gazed out my window, Lea told me after some thought:I\u2019m not disordered\u2026 I\u2019m traumatized. We\u2019d discussed this several times before, but on this day the realization seemed to hit her as fully true. That day changed Lea\u2019s life. Her journey towards healing was not done at this point, but something fundamental had shifted. She\u2019d finally shed the psychiatric explanation for her reactions and embraced a contextualized, meaningful approach. We began to explore what else she was: Creative, caring, analytical, and also less flattering but equally important aspects. By and by she developed a nuanced and integrated understanding of herself that was defined neither by diagnoses nor trauma, but rather by just being Lea with all which that entailed, with a self-compassionate outlook on her previous (and sometimes present) modes of being in this world. The progress that Lea and I achieved would not have been possible if we\u2019d worked within the established framework of psychiatric therapeutic treatment protocols. No protocol teaches you to like your patients, to care and root for them, and to embrace all their many ways of being themselves without judgment (and, indeed, without pathologizing). David had been depressed for a long time when I met him. The psychiatric treatment for his diagnosis\u2014bipolar disorder\u2014had little effect other than to quell some of his anxiety, which, admittedly, did serve to help him cope in the short run. After a few sessions I asked David: \u201cAre you aware that you\u2019re constantly monitoring your own mood?\u201d He said: \u201cYes, of course, I\u2019m deathly scared of becoming manic again! Or becoming depressed again, like I used to be. But I\u2019ll probably kill myself if I become manic. I could never put my family and friends through that again!\u201d His first manic episode occurred a few years after he\u2019d started treatment for depression with SSRIs. This is not uncommon, as the number of manic episodes in the population has exploded since the introduction of so-called antidepressants (which, evidence-wise, can\u2019t actually be said to be antidepressive). David was also under severe stress during the time when he experienced a manic episode: He tried to balance a fast-paced career, several hobbies, independent projects and many relationships all at once. The more we explored the circumstances of his mania, that more it made sense that his mind would launch into overdrive in an attempt to cope, even to a degree where he lost his grasp of reality. David and I did therapy in the sense that we collaborated on understanding his thoughts and feelings, both past and present. But we also did something else that was very helpful on its own: I providedtruepsychoeducation. Now, psychoeducation is usually taken to mean an expert explaining this or that about mental suffering, usually in the form of diagnoses and treatments. And few diagnoses are as adamantly claimed to be biological in nature (counter to all evidence) as much as bipolar disorder. David had been psychoeducated to accept his mood swings, mania and depressive episodes as hisneurologicalhard wiring. I told him that that was just plain wrong. That no one has ever established any such thing to be true for people diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Although David trusted in me, it took a while (and some reading on his own) before he accepted that I was right. That bipolar is indeed only a name psychiatry has for a certain type of behavior. This also led to a gradual discontinuation of the medical treatment with assistance from a Danish nonprofit that offers guidance on stepping down from psychopharmaceutical drugs. If bipolar is neither a chemical imbalance nor a brain dysfunction, then there is little reason in trying to \u2018correct\u2019 a non-existent problem. For David, depsychiatrization meant re-education on some of the fallacies and flat-out lies that patients are told during psychiatric treatment. This allowed him to oppose the instructions that he\u2019d been given, including the hypermonitoring of his own mood. With his own words: \u201cI\u2019m no longer afraid to wake up in the morning. I don\u2019t fear waking a little bit sad, and I don\u2019t fear waking up a little bit glad. Those moods are natural, and it is unlikely that I will become psychotic or manic again, since my life has changed so much since I first collapsed\u201d. \u201cDo you have anything I can stir my coffee with?\u201d she asked at the beginning of our very first session. I\u2019d offered\u2014as I usually do\u2014instant coffee but had failed to provide anything to stir with. I answered \u201cYeah, sure, just grab that knife on the shelf right there and stir with the handle.\u201d She froze. She froze long enough for me to notice. I sat down and waited. She did take the knife and stir her coffee, and as she sat, I asked her \u201cIt seemed something just happened. What was that?\u201d She hesitated before saying: \u201cI\u2019m just so used to the idea that I\u2019m dangerous that I couldn\u2019t believe that you just offered me a knife\u201d. Laura had been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia earlier in life. She\u2019d been out of the system as well as out of medication for some years, but she\u2019d never found peace with herself. She sought me out through recommendation from another therapist who thought I\u2019d be a good match for the task at hand. This turned out to be true. As is true in almost all cases, that which psychiatry had labeled \u2018paranoid schizophrenia\u2019 was mostly trauma responses. Laura had had a rough childhood. She hadn\u2019t ever really thought of herself as psychotic, but she did hear voices at a point in time. Psychiatric treatment did lessen the voice hearing to an extent, but along with the voices she lost a lot of herself. She fully internalized the idea that she was mentally ill and concluded that she was therefore a burden on her family, friends and society, leading to several suicide attempts. The medication made her unhealthy and uncaring, and she gave up on her dreams, including that of having a family of her own, a career and a happy relationship. In fact, she was told by several professionals that the outlook wasn\u2019t positive with regards to those dreams. Hearing this part of her story, I reflected out loud: \u201cWell, if anything\u2019s gonna convince you to kill yourself, it\u2019d be that: Being a diagnosed burden with no possibility of a better future\u201d. Laura laughed at that. It even became a thing: \u201cHere comes the burden!\u201d she\u2019d proclaim on entering my office. But it\u2019s true: The way psychiatry defines e.g. voice hearing steals away hope, context and meaning, and it adds stigmatizing narratives such as the perceived danger of being around people diagnosed with schizophrenia. People who hear voices or have other extra-sensory experiences are not more dangerous than other people. The public just tend to hear that narrative a lot, whenever something tragic happens involving someone who is diagnosed. But voice hearing is neither dangerous nor uncommon. It\u2019s a natural phenomenon that some experience to a higher and more manifest degree than others, especially those that are exposed to childhood trauma. Trauma-informed therapy was necessary to help Laura. She needed help to deal with the adverse experiences that had landed her in psychiatry in the first place. But first we needed to deal with a lot of the harm that psychiatry itself had done to her and her way of thinking about herself. This involved active participation by both family and friends, some of whom were invited to hear a very different story about Laura from the one where she was a paranoid schizophrenic. People fear what they don\u2019t understand, and this unfortunately often goes for close relations as well as strangers. But hearing a story that you connect with and understand makes the other person\u2019s mental distress familiar and natural, and it engages empathy and connectedness which are fundamental precursors for the kind of healing and comfort that only close relationships can provide. I could tell countless more cases like Lea\u2019s, David\u2019s and Laura\u2019s. If you add onto those all of the cases that I\u2019ve read and been told outside of therapy, then that strongly indicates a staggering universality in the way in which psychiatric treatment teaches patients to understand themselves in ways that are harmful and invalidating to them. It follows naturally that learning to dispel these (mis)understandings from the mind in a safe, supportive environment paves the way for other, more constructive and compassionate self-concepts. Depsychiatrization is thus not a battleagainstsomething as much as it is a battleforsomething: It is for the right to understand yourself as a normally reacting person who deserves to be understood on your own terms. I\u2019ve mostly worked with depsychiatrization in individual therapy. I do believe, however, that the concept has just as much potential as a group intervention and even as a community intervention. In group therapy, it\u2019d be possible to systematically undo the most common misconceptions spread by psychiatry in a setting where former (or current) patients would be safe and free to ask questions and be doubtful. It\u2019d also be possible to work together on common themes that tend to arise with psychiatric internalization, for instance the loss of hope of any meaningful future. Depsychiatrization would lend itself perfectly to a group setting, where the group could also help each other mirror nonpathologizing perspectives on those sides of each group member that psychiatry has pathologized. As a community intervention, it\u2019d be interesting to see what would happen if established institutions and organizations were to adopt a fully nonpathologizing approach. This would not necessarily entail the abrupt discontinuation of all collaboration with psychiatry, especially for practical reasons seeing as how psychiatry is almost universally involved in mental suffering in our day and age. But what would happen if mental health professionals outside of psychiatry rejected the legitimacy of diagnoses to say anything at all meaningful about the person we\u2019re meant to help? Another form of nonpathologizing community intervention could be peer-run facilities. These do tend to be nonpathologizing in nature already, as they tend to grow out of a strong desire for creating a space to receive help that is not expert-driven, but rather driven by universal needs and rights that the mentally distressed individual has. I can strongly recommend looking up two places that I\u2019ve come across during my time as an activist: Leeds Survivor-Led Crisis Service in England and The Wildflower Alliance in the US. Both places excel at offering something that is fundamentally different from pathologizing, and which allows the distressed person to grow and heal out of a pathologized self-concept. Depsychiatrization is not new, not in the sense that a lot of peer-run organizations already provide the space to achieve the same. The novelty in the concept lies in the distinct choice to formalize and label the process of dispelling those psychiatrically imposed self-narratives that do the most harm. It is a way of reclaiming the right to be understood through a nonpathologizing, rehumanized lens rather than as a pathologically afflicted, disordered patient. It is my hope that depsychiatrization will inspire and provide a platform for new discussions amongst professionals and those with lived experiences alike. *** Mad in America hosts blogs by a diverse group of writers.

Report comment Moyu Watari-AlvarezJune 6, 2025 at 5:30 amDear Jonas Vennike Ditlevsen,Thank you for your article.I have received psychiatric care in Germany since 2010, when I experienced my first psychotic episode. Since then, I have been admitted to psychiatric clinics four times: Three times due to acute psychosis (in 2010, 2018, and 2019), and once due to burnout this year.My experiences in psychiatric care have varied greatly depending on whether I was recovering from psychosis or burnout.For the past eight years, I have had a trusting relationship with my psychiatrist, who treats me as an equal.From my personal perspective, I believe that psychiatry can be helpful, empowering, and healing. My diagnoses do not stand in my way.That\u2019s why I consider the question of what is meant by \u201cpsychiatry\u201d and \u201cdepsychiatrization\u201d urgent and important.When I first read your article, I found myself hoping for a more nuanced view of these terms. Perhaps one that reflects the diversity and complexity of people\u2019s experiences with psychiatric care.Best wishes,MoyuReport commentReplyCatJune 7, 2025 at 9:15 pmDear Moyu,Consider this hypothetical: if your mother was prescribed Thalidomide during her pregnancy and you were fortunate enough to be born without any physical impairments\u2014unlike the numerous infants who suffered severe congenital malformations\u2014would you still endorse the use of that drug? This scenario mirrors the criticisms levied against the field of psychiatry. While you may perceive your experiences, including your ongoing relationship with a psychiatrist and hospitalisation, as beneficial or \u201cempowering,\u201d it\u2019s critical to acknowledge that countless individuals have faced significant harm, enduring disabilities, or even fatalities as a result of psychiatric interventions, including unborn children exposed to psychiatric drugs.It may be worthwhile for you to reflect on the complexities and ethical considerations inherent in this field.Kind regards,CatReport commentReplyMoyu Watari-AlvarezJune 8, 2025 at 3:55 amDear Cat,Thank you for your response.I\u2019m wondering how you intended the comparison between psychiatry and the chemical substance thalidomide to work. The composition of a substance never changes, regardless of time or place. However, this does not align with my experience of psychiatry.To me, it is first and foremost a human construct and a product of human relationships. This is why I believe it is important to consider how we understand and interpret it. In my view, neither psychiatry nor diagnoses are inherently problematic. What matters is how they are practised and experienced.Of course, there are structural and individual issues in psychiatric care. It is crucial that platforms such as Mad in America exist to provide a space for justified and often necessary criticism. I have had very different experiences myself, and I know many people who have experienced little to no healing through psychiatry.For this reason, I hope Mad in America fosters discussion not only among like-minded critics, but also with those who have different views \u2014 including the professionals who are often criticised. Shouldn\u2019t we stand together and reflect on how to transform psychiatry into a discipline that prioritises healing over management?Perhaps we ultimately mean the same thing and I simply did not express myself clearly enough in my original comment.Best wishes,MoyuReport commentReplySteve McCreaJune 8, 2025 at 12:51 pmI\u2019m not sure psychiatry can be transformed into anything other than what it has become. I see too many conflicts of interest and too much money being made by the status quo. Having been a professional dissenter within the system, I can say that there seemed to be very little interest in changing despite demonstrating the effectiveness of a different approach. I could only conclude that healing is NOT a priority of the psychiatric system, and in fact, they tend to find it threatening to their prerogatives. The investment in biological theories of \u201cmental illness\u201d was so intense as to approach obsession in many, and attempts to soften it, I found, were more than unwelcome. How do you change a system whose basic intent is not to heal but to control?Report commentReplyMoyu Watari-AlvarezJune 8, 2025 at 4:06 pmDear Steve McCrea,Thank you for your reply, too.Your experience of being a professional dissenter within the psychiatric system provides a valuable and powerful perspective. I take your view that there may be little chance of transforming the system for the better seriously.I find the question of what \u2018healing psychiatric care\u2019 might mean, both individually and structurally, deeply complex and worth exploring. I don\u2019t have any simple solutions, but I believe it\u2019s an important conversation to continue.Having followed Mad in America on and off for over ten years, I submitted my second personal story nearly six weeks ago. It recounts a highly positive experience I had at the day clinics of the university hospital here in Heidelberg, Germany.I believed the piece offered a strong example of how psychiatry can be practised in a way that supports healing. However, to my surprise, I haven\u2019t received any acknowledgement or response from the editors.That\u2019s why I hope Mad in America will continue to welcome voices that aim to bridge the gap between critics of psychiatry and its practitioners. I believe that dialogue across that divide is vital if we want to see meaningful change.Best wishes,MoyuReport commentSteve McCreaJune 8, 2025 at 5:08 pmI hope we get to read it soon. That sounds like the kind of care we need to see encouraged!Report commentBirdsongJune 8, 2025 at 2:46 pmMoyu, if you\u2019re interested in meaningfully broadening your perspective regarding critical psychiatry, I highly recommend the following video: \u201cThis Psychiatrist Says Chemical Imbalance is a Lie\u201d, an interview with Dr. Joanna Moncrieff from Dr. Josef Witt-Doerring\u2019s video series on the psychiatric profession, its drugs, and the obstacles and challenges many people face when trying to taper from psychiatric drugs.Report commentReplyCatJune 8, 2025 at 8:50 pmDear Moyu,I disagree with your thesis that \u201cpsychiatry nor diagnoses are (not) inherently problematic.\u201d I previously compared prescribing Thalidomide to psychiatry because, like the irreversible damage Thalidomide causes, psychiatric practices also cause severe, and often irreversible damage, including to unborn humans and animals (Zanni, G., et al, 2025).Psychiatric diagnoses are not physical diseases of the brain; they are a \u201cmyth\u201d (Szasz, T. 1961) of circular reasoning fallacy. They have no known biological origin, nor are there any tests to provide independent objective data in support of any psychiatric diagnosis (CEP, 2014). Psychiatry continually fails to identify and confirm any physical or chemical abnormality as a psychiatric \u2018illness\u2019 according to the Virchowian standard of disease (Breeding, J. 2014). If an individual exhibits multiple symptoms attributed to a \u2018disorder\u2019 from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, Fifth Edition, Text Revision (American Psychiatric Association., 2022) psychiatrists can diagnose them with a \u2018mental illness\u2019. Psychiatry alleges a person has a \u2018mental illness\u2019 because they display symptoms of an unproven condition; a form of circular logic that fails to identify or explain the cause of any diagnosis (Burstow, B., 2016).The foundational approach to psychiatric treatment involves brain-disabling interventions such as tranquillisers, stimulants, hallucinogens and painkillers that do not correct or improve the alleged brain dysfunction (Breggin, P. 1991). Wrongly labelled as \u2018antidepressants\u2019, \u2018antipsychotics\u2019, \u2018mood stabilisers\u2019 or \u2018ADHD medication\u2019 (Cima, R., 2025), these drugs cause a host of serious side effects, including emotional and behavioural alterations, chronic brain impairment and atrophy, chronic illness, neurotoxicity, addiction, akathisia, tardive dyskinesia, disability and premature death (Whitaker, R. 2010, Breggin, P. 1991, & Gotzsche, P. et al, 2015).The American Psychiatric Association claims that electroshock is superior to brain-disabling drugs for a variety of unproven \u2018mental illnesses\u2019, yet it admits that the distinct mechanisms by which it wields its consequences are \u201celusive\u201d (Kritzer, M.D., et al, 2023, & Deng, Z.D., et al, 2023). Electroshock involves applying electricity to the brain of an anaesthetised individual through electrodes to induce a tonic-clonic seizure. It causes individuals to experience impaired judgment, headache, loss of personality, cardiac difficulties, emotional instability, nausea, temporary or enduring memory loss, stroke, disorientation, prolonged seizures, confusion, and death. The results worsen and are perpetual as they continue to be administered (Gotzsche, P., 2023; & Breggin, P.,1994).During psychiatric hospitalisation, an individual can legally be subjected to indefinite incarceration, physical and manual restraint, chemical restraint using brain-damaging drugs, solitary confinement, neurosurgery, and electroshock treatment. Psychiatric incarceration breaches the internationally ratified Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (United Nations, 1984) and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disability (United Nations, 2006). Furthermore, suicide in \u2018mental health\u2019 or psychiatric hospitals is fifty times higher than in the general population (Chammas, F., et al, 2022), and previous inpatients have suicide rates that are around thirty times greater than international rates (Chung, D. T., 2017).Whilst Thalidomide\u2019s composition never changes, neither does psychiatry\u2019s- it always causes harm. We should not \u201cstand together and reflect on how to transform psychiatry into a discipline that prioritises healing over management.\u201d Psychiatry is beyond repair and must be abolished. Furthermore, Mad In America is one of the few platforms that are brave enough to criticise psychiatry. People with \u201cdifferent views\u201d and \u201cprofessionals who are often criticised\u201d have plenty of support from mainstream propaganda outlets.Kind regards,CatReport commentReplyJonas Vennike DitlevsenJune 8, 2025 at 8:00 amI would, akin to @Cat, argue that whereas it absolutely is possible to receive genuinely good care within the psychiatric system, that is a result of a dissenting few working within the system. There defintitely are employees who offer compassion, understanding and equal footing. But the system and its underlying logic work in opposition to equality and empowerment. The pathologization of mental distress is a severe barrier to furthering our understanding of how to help people thrive.Report commentReplySteve McCreaJune 8, 2025 at 12:46 pmHaving been one of those dissenters, I can tell you that they get a lot of crap for offering compassion, understanding and equal footing. Those in charge seem to be categorically opposed to anything that empowers clients!Report commentReplyMoyu Watari-AlvarezJune 10, 2025 at 4:07 amThank you all again for your thoughtful feedback and references.I would just like to clarify that I am not claiming that psychiatry has never caused irreversible harm, nor that the call for depsychiatrisation presented in the article is unjustified.However, when I reflect on the history of psychiatry in Germany, I recognise significant developments over the past 80 to 90 years. These range from the systematic killing of people with mental health conditions and disabilities under the Nazi regime to the Psychiatrie-Enquete of the 1970s, which initiated important deinstitutionalisation reforms and a shift towards more patient-centred care. More recently, the S3 Guidelines on Schizophrenia have acknowledged the importance of quality of life for those affected and recommended using the lowest possible dose of neuroleptics.Such progress would hardly have been possible without the persistent efforts of psychiatry\u2019s critics. This is precisely why I think it\u2019s important that everyone is free to live life as they personally see fit. Our social fabric depends on a diversity of opinions and beliefs, shaped by individual experiences, hopes and expectations. Ultimately, only what proves to be sustainable will endure, whatever \u2018sustainable\u2019 may mean in this context.Report commentReply Dear Jonas Vennike Ditlevsen, Thank you for your article.

Best wishes,Moyu Report comment CatJune 7, 2025 at 9:15 pmDear Moyu,Consider this hypothetical: if your mother was prescribed Thalidomide during her pregnancy and you were fortunate enough to be born without any physical impairments\u2014unlike the numerous infants who suffered severe congenital malformations\u2014would you still endorse the use of that drug? This scenario mirrors the criticisms levied against the field of psychiatry. While you may perceive your experiences, including your ongoing relationship with a psychiatrist and hospitalisation, as beneficial or \u201cempowering,\u201d it\u2019s critical to acknowledge that countless individuals have faced significant harm, enduring disabilities, or even fatalities as a result of psychiatric interventions, including unborn children exposed to psychiatric drugs.It may be worthwhile for you to reflect on the complexities and ethical considerations inherent in this field.Kind regards,CatReport commentReplyMoyu Watari-AlvarezJune 8, 2025 at 3:55 amDear Cat,Thank you for your response.I\u2019m wondering how you intended the comparison between psychiatry and the chemical substance thalidomide to work. The composition of a substance never changes, regardless of time or place. However, this does not align with my experience of psychiatry.To me, it is first and foremost a human construct and a product of human relationships. This is why I believe it is important to consider how we understand and interpret it. In my view, neither psychiatry nor diagnoses are inherently problematic. What matters is how they are practised and experienced.Of course, there are structural and individual issues in psychiatric care. It is crucial that platforms such as Mad in America exist to provide a space for justified and often necessary criticism. I have had very different experiences myself, and I know many people who have experienced little to no healing through psychiatry.For this reason, I hope Mad in America fosters discussion not only among like-minded critics, but also with those who have different views \u2014 including the professionals who are often criticised. Shouldn\u2019t we stand together and reflect on how to transform psychiatry into a discipline that prioritises healing over management?Perhaps we ultimately mean the same thing and I simply did not express myself clearly enough in my original comment.Best wishes,MoyuReport commentReplySteve McCreaJune 8, 2025 at 12:51 pmI\u2019m not sure psychiatry can be transformed into anything other than what it has become. I see too many conflicts of interest and too much money being made by the status quo. Having been a professional dissenter within the system, I can say that there seemed to be very little interest in changing despite demonstrating the effectiveness of a different approach. I could only conclude that healing is NOT a priority of the psychiatric system, and in fact, they tend to find it threatening to their prerogatives. The investment in biological theories of \u201cmental illness\u201d was so intense as to approach obsession in many, and attempts to soften it, I found, were more than unwelcome. How do you change a system whose basic intent is not to heal but to control?Report commentReplyMoyu Watari-AlvarezJune 8, 2025 at 4:06 pmDear Steve McCrea,Thank you for your reply, too.Your experience of being a professional dissenter within the psychiatric system provides a valuable and powerful perspective. I take your view that there may be little chance of transforming the system for the better seriously.I find the question of what \u2018healing psychiatric care\u2019 might mean, both individually and structurally, deeply complex and worth exploring. I don\u2019t have any simple solutions, but I believe it\u2019s an important conversation to continue.Having followed Mad in America on and off for over ten years, I submitted my second personal story nearly six weeks ago. It recounts a highly positive experience I had at the day clinics of the university hospital here in Heidelberg, Germany.I believed the piece offered a strong example of how psychiatry can be practised in a way that supports healing. However, to my surprise, I haven\u2019t received any acknowledgement or response from the editors.That\u2019s why I hope Mad in America will continue to welcome voices that aim to bridge the gap between critics of psychiatry and its practitioners. I believe that dialogue across that divide is vital if we want to see meaningful change.Best wishes,MoyuReport commentSteve McCreaJune 8, 2025 at 5:08 pmI hope we get to read it soon.

They have no known biological origin, nor are there any tests to provide independent objective data in support of any psychiatric diagnosis (CEP, 2014). Psychiatry continually fails to identify and confirm any physical or chemical abnormality as a psychiatric \u2018illness\u2019 according to the Virchowian standard of disease (Breeding, J. 2014). If an individual exhibits multiple symptoms attributed to a \u2018disorder\u2019 from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, Fifth Edition, Text Revision (American Psychiatric Association., 2022) psychiatrists can diagnose them with a \u2018mental illness\u2019. Psychiatry alleges a person has a \u2018mental illness\u2019 because they display symptoms of an unproven condition; a form of circular logic that fails to identify or explain the cause of any diagnosis (Burstow, B., 2016).The foundational approach to psychiatric treatment involves brain-disabling interventions such as tranquillisers, stimulants, hallucinogens and painkillers that do not correct or improve the alleged brain dysfunction (Breggin, P. 1991). Wrongly labelled as \u2018antidepressants\u2019, \u2018antipsychotics\u2019, \u2018mood stabilisers\u2019 or \u2018ADHD medication\u2019 (Cima, R., 2025), these drugs cause a host of serious side effects, including emotional and behavioural alterations, chronic brain impairment and atrophy, chronic illness, neurotoxicity, addiction, akathisia, tardive dyskinesia, disability and premature death (Whitaker, R. 2010, Breggin, P. 1991, & Gotzsche, P. et al, 2015).The American Psychiatric Association claims that electroshock is superior to brain-disabling drugs for a variety of unproven \u2018mental illnesses\u2019, yet it admits that the distinct mechanisms by which it wields its consequences are \u201celusive\u201d (Kritzer, M.D., et al, 2023, & Deng, Z.D., et al, 2023). Electroshock involves applying electricity to the brain of an anaesthetised individual through electrodes to induce a tonic-clonic seizure. It causes individuals to experience impaired judgment, headache, loss of personality, cardiac difficulties, emotional instability, nausea, temporary or enduring memory loss, stroke, disorientation, prolonged seizures, confusion, and death. The results worsen and are perpetual as they continue to be administered (Gotzsche, P., 2023; & Breggin, P.,1994).During psychiatric hospitalisation, an individual can legally be subjected to indefinite incarceration, physical and manual restraint, chemical restraint using brain-damaging drugs, solitary confinement, neurosurgery, and electroshock treatment. Psychiatric incarceration breaches the internationally ratified Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (United Nations, 1984) and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disability (United Nations, 2006). Furthermore, suicide in \u2018mental health\u2019 or psychiatric hospitals is fifty times higher than in the general population (Chammas, F., et al, 2022), and previous inpatients have suicide rates that are around thirty times greater than international rates (Chung, D. T., 2017).Whilst Thalidomide\u2019s composition never changes, neither does psychiatry\u2019s- it always causes harm. We should not \u201cstand together and reflect on how to transform psychiatry into a discipline that prioritises healing over management.\u201d Psychiatry is beyond repair and must be abolished. Furthermore, Mad In America is one of the few platforms that are brave enough to criticise psychiatry. People with \u201cdifferent views\u201d and \u201cprofessionals who are often criticised\u201d have plenty of support from mainstream propaganda outlets.Kind regards,CatReport commentReply Dear Moyu, Consider this hypothetical: if your mother was prescribed Thalidomide during her pregnancy and you were fortunate enough to be born without any physical impairments\u2014unlike the numerous infants who suffered severe congenital malformations\u2014would you still endorse the use of that drug?

The American Psychiatric Association claims that electroshock is superior to brain-disabling drugs for a variety of unproven \u2018mental illnesses\u2019, yet it admits that the distinct mechanisms by which it wields its consequences are \u201celusive\u201d (Kritzer, M.D., et al, 2023, & Deng, Z.D., et al, 2023). Electroshock involves applying electricity to the brain of an anaesthetised individual through electrodes to induce a tonic-clonic seizure. It causes individuals to experience impaired judgment, headache, loss of personality, cardiac difficulties, emotional instability, nausea, temporary or enduring memory loss, stroke, disorientation, prolonged seizures, confusion, and death. The results worsen and are perpetual as they continue to be administered (Gotzsche, P., 2023; & Breggin, P.,1994). During psychiatric hospitalisation, an individual can legally be subjected to indefinite incarceration, physical and manual restraint, chemical restraint using brain-damaging drugs, solitary confinement, neurosurgery, and electroshock treatment. Psychiatric incarceration breaches the internationally ratified Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (United Nations, 1984) and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disability (United Nations, 2006). Furthermore, suicide in \u2018mental health\u2019 or psychiatric hospitals is fifty times higher than in the general population (Chammas, F., et al, 2022), and previous inpatients have suicide rates that are around thirty times greater than international rates (Chung, D. T., 2017). Whilst Thalidomide\u2019s composition never changes, neither does psychiatry\u2019s- it always causes harm. We should not \u201cstand together and reflect on how to transform psychiatry into a discipline that prioritises healing over management.\u201d Psychiatry is beyond repair and must be abolished. Furthermore, Mad In America is one of the few platforms that are brave enough to criticise psychiatry. People with \u201cdifferent views\u201d and \u201cprofessionals who are often criticised\u201d have plenty of support from mainstream propaganda outlets. Kind regards, Cat Report comment Jonas Vennike DitlevsenJune 8, 2025 at 8:00 amI would, akin to @Cat, argue that whereas it absolutely is possible to receive genuinely good care within the psychiatric system, that is a result of a dissenting few working within the system. There defintitely are employees who offer compassion, understanding and equal footing. But the system and its underlying logic work in opposition to equality and empowerment.

I have received psychiatric care in Germany since 2010, when I experienced my first psychotic episode. Since then, I have been admitted to psychiatric clinics four times: Three times due to acute psychosis (in 2010, 2018, and 2019), and once due to burnout this year. My experiences in psychiatric care have varied greatly depending on whether I was recovering from psychosis or burnout. For the past eight years, I have had a trusting relationship with my psychiatrist, who treats me as an equal. From my personal perspective, I believe that psychiatry can be helpful, empowering, and healing. My diagnoses do not stand in my way. That\u2019s why I consider the question of what is meant by \u201cpsychiatry\u201d and \u201cdepsychiatrization\u201d urgent and important. When I first read your article, I found myself hoping for a more nuanced view of these terms. Perhaps one that reflects the diversity and complexity of people\u2019s experiences with psychiatric care. Best wishes,Moyu Report comment CatJune 7, 2025 at 9:15 pmDear Moyu,Consider this hypothetical: if your mother was prescribed Thalidomide during her pregnancy and you were fortunate enough to be born without any physical impairments\u2014unlike the numerous infants who suffered severe congenital malformations\u2014would you still endorse the use of that drug? This scenario mirrors the criticisms levied against the field of psychiatry. While you may perceive your experiences, including your ongoing relationship with a psychiatrist and hospitalisation, as beneficial or \u201cempowering,\u201d it\u2019s critical to acknowledge that countless individuals have faced significant harm, enduring disabilities, or even fatalities as a result of psychiatric interventions, including unborn children exposed to psychiatric drugs.It may be worthwhile for you to reflect on the complexities and ethical considerations inherent in this field.Kind regards,CatReport commentReplyMoyu Watari-AlvarezJune 8, 2025 at 3:55 amDear Cat,Thank you for your response.I\u2019m wondering how you intended the comparison between psychiatry and the chemical substance thalidomide to work. The composition of a substance never changes, regardless of time or place. However, this does not align with my experience of psychiatry.To me, it is first and foremost a human construct and a product of human relationships. This is why I believe it is important to consider how we understand and interpret it. In my view, neither psychiatry nor diagnoses are inherently problematic. What matters is how they are practised and experienced.Of course, there are structural and individual issues in psychiatric care. It is crucial that platforms such as Mad in America exist to provide a space for justified and often necessary criticism. I have had very different experiences myself, and I know many people who have experienced little to no healing through psychiatry.For this reason, I hope Mad in America fosters discussion not only among like-minded critics, but also with those who have different views \u2014 including the professionals who are often criticised. Shouldn\u2019t we stand together and reflect on how to transform psychiatry into a discipline that prioritises healing over management?Perhaps we ultimately mean the same thing and I simply did not express myself clearly enough in my original comment.Best wishes,MoyuReport commentReplySteve McCreaJune 8, 2025 at 12:51 pmI\u2019m not sure psychiatry can be transformed into anything other than what it has become.

They have no known biological origin, nor are there any tests to provide independent objective data in support of any psychiatric diagnosis (CEP, 2014).

Report comment CatJune 8, 2025 at 8:50 pmDear Moyu,I disagree with your thesis that \u201cpsychiatry nor diagnoses are (not) inherently problematic.\u201d I previously compared prescribing Thalidomide to psychiatry because, like the irreversible damage Thalidomide causes, psychiatric practices also cause severe, and often irreversible damage, including to unborn humans and animals (Zanni, G., et al, 2025).Psychiatric diagnoses are not physical diseases of the brain; they are a \u201cmyth\u201d (Szasz, T. 1961) of circular reasoning fallacy. They have no known biological origin, nor are there any tests to provide independent objective data in support of any psychiatric diagnosis (CEP, 2014). Psychiatry continually fails to identify and confirm any physical or chemical abnormality as a psychiatric \u2018illness\u2019 according to the Virchowian standard of disease (Breeding, J. 2014). If an individual exhibits multiple symptoms attributed to a \u2018disorder\u2019 from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, Fifth Edition, Text Revision (American Psychiatric Association., 2022) psychiatrists can diagnose them with a \u2018mental illness\u2019. Psychiatry alleges a person has a \u2018mental illness\u2019 because they display symptoms of an unproven condition; a form of circular logic that fails to identify or explain the cause of any diagnosis (Burstow, B., 2016).The foundational approach to psychiatric treatment involves brain-disabling interventions such as tranquillisers, stimulants, hallucinogens and painkillers that do not correct or improve the alleged brain dysfunction (Breggin, P. 1991). Wrongly labelled as \u2018antidepressants\u2019, \u2018antipsychotics\u2019, \u2018mood stabilisers\u2019 or \u2018ADHD medication\u2019 (Cima, R., 2025), these drugs cause a host of serious side effects, including emotional and behavioural alterations, chronic brain impairment and atrophy, chronic illness, neurotoxicity, addiction, akathisia, tardive dyskinesia, disability and premature death (Whitaker, R. 2010, Breggin, P. 1991, & Gotzsche, P. et al, 2015).The American Psychiatric Association claims that electroshock is superior to brain-disabling drugs for a variety of unproven \u2018mental illnesses\u2019, yet it admits that the distinct mechanisms by which it wields its consequences are \u201celusive\u201d (Kritzer, M.D., et al, 2023, & Deng, Z.D., et al, 2023). Electroshock involves applying electricity to the brain of an anaesthetised individual through electrodes to induce a tonic-clonic seizure. It causes individuals to experience impaired judgment, headache, loss of personality, cardiac difficulties, emotional instability, nausea, temporary or enduring memory loss, stroke, disorientation, prolonged seizures, confusion, and death. The results worsen and are perpetual as they continue to be administered (Gotzsche, P., 2023; & Breggin, P.,1994).During psychiatric hospitalisation, an individual can legally be subjected to indefinite incarceration, physical and manual restraint, chemical restraint using brain-damaging drugs, solitary confinement, neurosurgery, and electroshock treatment. Psychiatric incarceration breaches the internationally ratified Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (United Nations, 1984) and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disability (United Nations, 2006). Furthermore, suicide in \u2018mental health\u2019 or psychiatric hospitals is fifty times higher than in the general population (Chammas, F., et al, 2022), and previous inpatients have suicide rates that are around thirty times greater than international rates (Chung, D. T., 2017).Whilst Thalidomide\u2019s composition never changes, neither does psychiatry\u2019s- it always causes harm. We should not \u201cstand together and reflect on how to transform psychiatry into a discipline that prioritises healing over management.\u201d Psychiatry is beyond repair and must be abolished.

Kind regards, Cat Report comment Dear Moyu, Consider this hypothetical: if your mother was prescribed Thalidomide during her pregnancy and you were fortunate enough to be born without any physical impairments\u2014unlike the numerous infants who suffered severe congenital malformations\u2014would you still endorse the use of that drug? This scenario mirrors the criticisms levied against the field of psychiatry. While you may perceive your experiences, including your ongoing relationship with a psychiatrist and hospitalisation, as beneficial or \u201cempowering,\u201d it\u2019s critical to acknowledge that countless individuals have faced significant harm, enduring disabilities, or even fatalities as a result of psychiatric interventions, including unborn children exposed to psychiatric drugs. It may be worthwhile for you to reflect on the complexities and ethical considerations inherent in this field. Kind regards, Cat Report comment Moyu Watari-AlvarezJune 8, 2025 at 3:55 amDear Cat,Thank you for your response.I\u2019m wondering how you intended the comparison between psychiatry and the chemical substance thalidomide to work. The composition of a substance never changes, regardless of time or place. However, this does not align with my experience of psychiatry.To me, it is first and foremost a human construct and a product of human relationships. This is why I believe it is important to consider how we understand and interpret it. In my view, neither psychiatry nor diagnoses are inherently problematic. What matters is how they are practised and experienced.Of course, there are structural and individual issues in psychiatric care. It is crucial that platforms such as Mad in America exist to provide a space for justified and often necessary criticism. I have had very different experiences myself, and I know many people who have experienced little to no healing through psychiatry.For this reason, I hope Mad in America fosters discussion not only among like-minded critics, but also with those who have different views \u2014 including the professionals who are often criticised. Shouldn\u2019t we stand together and reflect on how to transform psychiatry into a discipline that prioritises healing over management?Perhaps we ultimately mean the same thing and I simply did not express myself clearly enough in my original comment.Best wishes,MoyuReport commentReplySteve McCreaJune 8, 2025 at 12:51 pmI\u2019m not sure psychiatry can be transformed into anything other than what it has become.

Having been a professional dissenter within the system, I can say that there seemed to be very little interest in changing despite demonstrating the effectiveness of a different approach.

Wrongly labelled as \u2018antidepressants\u2019, \u2018antipsychotics\u2019, \u2018mood stabilisers\u2019 or \u2018ADHD medication\u2019 (Cima, R., 2025), these drugs cause a host of serious side effects, including emotional and behavioural alterations, chronic brain impairment and atrophy, chronic illness, neurotoxicity, addiction, akathisia, tardive dyskinesia, disability and premature death (Whitaker, R. 2010, Breggin, P. 1991, & Gotzsche, P. et al, 2015). The American Psychiatric Association claims that electroshock is superior to brain-disabling drugs for a variety of unproven \u2018mental illnesses\u2019, yet it admits that the distinct mechanisms by which it wields its consequences are \u201celusive\u201d (Kritzer, M.D., et al, 2023, & Deng, Z.D., et al, 2023). Electroshock involves applying electricity to the brain of an anaesthetised individual through electrodes to induce a tonic-clonic seizure. It causes individuals to experience impaired judgment, headache, loss of personality, cardiac difficulties, emotional instability, nausea, temporary or enduring memory loss, stroke, disorientation, prolonged seizures, confusion, and death. The results worsen and are perpetual as they continue to be administered (Gotzsche, P., 2023; & Breggin, P.,1994). During psychiatric hospitalisation, an individual can legally be subjected to indefinite incarceration, physical and manual restraint, chemical restraint using brain-damaging drugs, solitary confinement, neurosurgery, and electroshock treatment. Psychiatric incarceration breaches the internationally ratified Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (United Nations, 1984) and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disability (United Nations, 2006). Furthermore, suicide in \u2018mental health\u2019 or psychiatric hospitals is fifty times higher than in the general population (Chammas, F., et al, 2022), and previous inpatients have suicide rates that are around thirty times greater than international rates (Chung, D. T., 2017). Whilst Thalidomide\u2019s composition never changes, neither does psychiatry\u2019s- it always causes harm. We should not \u201cstand together and reflect on how to transform psychiatry into a discipline that prioritises healing over management.\u201d Psychiatry is beyond repair and must be abolished. Furthermore, Mad In America is one of the few platforms that are brave enough to criticise psychiatry. People with \u201cdifferent views\u201d and \u201cprofessionals who are often criticised\u201d have plenty of support from mainstream propaganda outlets. Kind regards, Cat Report comment Dear Cat, Thank you for your response. I\u2019m wondering how you intended the comparison between psychiatry and the chemical substance thalidomide to work. The composition of a substance never changes, regardless of time or place. However, this does not align with my experience of psychiatry. To me, it is first and foremost a human construct and a product of human relationships. This is why I believe it is important to consider how we understand and interpret it. In my view, neither psychiatry nor diagnoses are inherently problematic. What matters is how they are practised and experienced. Of course, there are structural and individual issues in psychiatric care. It is crucial that platforms such as Mad in America exist to provide a space for justified and often necessary criticism. I have had very different experiences myself, and I know many people who have experienced little to no healing through psychiatry. For this reason, I hope Mad in America fosters discussion not only among like-minded critics, but also with those who have different views \u2014 including the professionals who are often criticised. Shouldn\u2019t we stand together and reflect on how to transform psychiatry into a discipline that prioritises healing over management? Perhaps we ultimately mean the same thing and I simply did not express myself clearly enough in my original comment. Best wishes,Moyu Report comment Steve McCreaJune 8, 2025 at 12:51 pmI\u2019m not sure psychiatry can be transformed into anything other than what it has become. I see too many conflicts of interest and too much money being made by the status quo. Having been a professional dissenter within the system, I can say that there seemed to be very little interest in changing despite demonstrating the effectiveness of a different approach. I could only conclude that healing is NOT a priority of the psychiatric system, and in fact, they tend to find it threatening to their prerogatives. The investment in biological theories of \u201cmental illness\u201d was so intense as to approach obsession in many, and attempts to soften it, I found, were more than unwelcome.

Report comment Moyu Watari-AlvarezJune 10, 2025 at 4:07 amThank you all again for your thoughtful feedback and references.I would just like to clarify that I am not claiming that psychiatry has never caused irreversible harm, nor that the call for depsychiatrisation presented in the article is unjustified.However, when I reflect on the history of psychiatry in Germany, I recognise significant developments over the past 80 to 90 years. These range from the systematic killing of people with mental health conditions and disabilities under the Nazi regime to the Psychiatrie-Enquete of the 1970s, which initiated important deinstitutionalisation reforms and a shift towards more patient-centred care. More recently, the S3 Guidelines on Schizophrenia have acknowledged the importance of quality of life for those affected and recommended using the lowest possible dose of neuroleptics.Such progress would hardly have been possible without the persistent efforts of psychiatry\u2019s critics.

I would just like to clarify that I am not claiming that psychiatry has never caused irreversible harm, nor that the call for depsychiatrisation presented in the article is unjustified. However, when I reflect on the history of psychiatry in Germany, I recognise significant developments over the past 80 to 90 years. These range from the systematic killing of people with mental health conditions and disabilities under the Nazi regime to the Psychiatrie-Enquete of the 1970s, which initiated important deinstitutionalisation reforms and a shift towards more patient-centred care. More recently, the S3 Guidelines on Schizophrenia have acknowledged the importance of quality of life for those affected and recommended using the lowest possible dose of neuroleptics. Such progress would hardly have been possible without the persistent efforts of psychiatry\u2019s critics.

Report comment BirdsongJune 6, 2025 at 4:14 pmThank you very much for writing such a sensitive, thoughtfully crafted article. Rehumanization is the only way to undo the extensive harm psychiatric labeling, and psychiatrization in general, keeps doing to people\u2019s self-concept, especially over time, not to mention the harmful dynamics psychiatrization creates in the minds of the people in their orbit and beyond.The key is seeing people as people, NOT as a psychiatric label in any way, shape, or form. Psychiatrization is a social malady practiced on the daily by psych professionals of all stripes. Indeed, today we live in the dark ages in this regard. It\u2019s a worldwide case of thought pollution and soul denigration.Hopefully enough people will eventually get to a place where psych professionals of any kind are rarely needed. This would be an important element of depsychiatrization because the very idea of a \u201cpsych \u201cprofessional\u201d of any kind comes with the harmful assumption that a power imbalance is necessary for \u201ctherapy\u201d to be \u201clegitimate\u201d.P.S.

Report comment CatJune 7, 2025 at 9:04 pmDear Jonas,You mentioned the role of individual therapy alongside the possibilities for group and community-based depsychiatrization. It\u2019s crucial to recognise, however, that many individuals embark on this journey alone.In my own experience, I ultimately decided to cease consultations with my psychiatrist, psychologist, and medical doctor after developing severe akathisia. This distressing symptom culminated in an involuntary hospitalization characterized by coercive practices, violence, and the administration of excessive pharmacological interventions. As a result, I undertook self-directed depsychiatrization, conducting a comprehensive review of relevant literature, including peer-reviewed articles and online resources, as well as engaging with insights from the psychiatry-survivor community. After a duration of twenty-two years on a regimen of three neurotoxic drugs, I successfully tapered off these substances with the assistance of microdoses of cannabis, achieved without any professional intervention.I urge you to consider the diverse and multifaceted pathways through which individuals can attain similar outcomes, particularly those that are self-initiated.

It\u2019s crucial to recognise, however, that many individuals embark on this journey alone. In my own experience, I ultimately decided to cease consultations with my psychiatrist, psychologist, and medical doctor after developing severe akathisia. This distressing symptom culminated in an involuntary hospitalization characterized by coercive practices, violence, and the administration of excessive pharmacological interventions. As a result, I undertook self-directed depsychiatrization, conducting a comprehensive review of relevant literature, including peer-reviewed articles and online resources, as well as engaging with insights from the psychiatry-survivor community. After a duration of twenty-two years on a regimen of three neurotoxic drugs, I successfully tapered off these substances with the assistance of microdoses of cannabis, achieved without any professional intervention. I urge you to consider the diverse and multifaceted pathways through which individuals can attain similar outcomes, particularly those that are self-initiated.

Report comment DogworldJune 9, 2025 at 2:57 pmThe problem with depsychiatrization as it\u2019s often practiced is that we remove the language of psychiatry but keep its structure.We take away the diagnosis but keep the hierarchy.We reject the chemical imbalance, but accept the benevolent expert.Now, instead of being managed by a psychiatrist, we are guided by a therapist, a coach, a group leader\u2014someone still in a position of power, still interpreting our pain for us, still being paid to help us become something better.This is where the story begins to repeat itself.It\u2019s like the colonizer who changes his clothes and says:\u201cI no longer bring chains or guns. I bring presence. I bring listening. I bring compassion.\u201dAnd the colonized says:\u201cYes, but you still stand above me. You still ask me to speak so you can understand. You still position yourself as the one who gives me something I need\u2014peace, healing, perspective. But I was not broken until I trusted someone like you the first time.\u201d\u201cIf we are to depsychiatrize, then let\u2019s truly de-internalize it. Let us not just replace the harshness of the institution with the warmth of a professional. Let us not treat your gentleness as liberation.\u201dBecause if we don\u2019t name how the therapist fills the same emotional role psychiatry once did\u2014offering regulated care in exchange for obedience, silence, or gratitude\u2014then we are simply modernizing the colonizer\u2019s strategy.Real depsychiatrization means not just removing the diagnosis.It means refusing to let anyone\u2014no matter how kind\u2014stand in the place where our own voice should be.It means remembering and recognizing:Even care can be a weapon.Even compassion can colonize.And even healing can be control\u2014when it doesn\u2019t come from within.Report commentReplyChristine BurnettJune 10, 2025 at 3:35 pmHi Dogworld,You said it well!! If we are going to have something better, I believe we would need a collective sharing of knowledge and working together. Personally, I feel that I have much more information of value from lived experience but I can see that isn\u2019t valued. I found that professionals involved in critical psychiatry aren\u2019t any more interested in what someone with lived experience can tell them than those who practice in the statue quo. They seem to equally push their view as proclaim experts.Report commentReply The problem with depsychiatrization as it\u2019s often practiced is that we remove the language of psychiatry but keep its structure.

I found that professionals involved in critical psychiatry aren\u2019t any more interested in what someone with lived experience can tell them than those who practice in the statue quo. They seem to equally push their view as proclaim experts.Report commentReply Hi Dogworld,You said it well!!

Report comment The problem with depsychiatrization as it\u2019s often practiced is that we remove the language of psychiatry but keep its structure. We take away the diagnosis but keep the hierarchy.We reject the chemical imbalance, but accept the benevolent expert.Now, instead of being managed by a psychiatrist, we are guided by a therapist, a coach, a group leader\u2014someone still in a position of power, still interpreting our pain for us, still being paid to help us become something better. This is where the story begins to repeat itself. It\u2019s like the colonizer who changes his clothes and says:\u201cI no longer bring chains or guns. I bring presence. I bring listening. I bring compassion.\u201d And the colonized says:\u201cYes, but you still stand above me. You still ask me to speak so you can understand. You still position yourself as the one who gives me something I need\u2014peace, healing, perspective. But I was not broken until I trusted someone like you the first time.\u201d \u201cIf we are to depsychiatrize, then let\u2019s truly de-internalize it. Let us not just replace the harshness of the institution with the warmth of a professional. Let us not treat your gentleness as liberation.\u201d Because if we don\u2019t name how the therapist fills the same emotional role psychiatry once did\u2014offering regulated care in exchange for obedience, silence, or gratitude\u2014then we are simply modernizing the colonizer\u2019s strategy. Real depsychiatrization means not just removing the diagnosis.It means refusing to let anyone\u2014no matter how kind\u2014stand in the place where our own voice should be. It means remembering and recognizing:Even care can be a weapon.Even compassion can colonize.And even healing can be control\u2014when it doesn\u2019t come from within.
