January 28:We\u2019re reviewing whether you can keep your TPS protections. February 5:Your TPS protections will expire on April 7, 2025. March 31:Your TPS protections can remain valid while a lawsuit about them is pending. May 19:Your TPS protections have already been revoked. Probably. We assume. With that last one \u2013 a single-page unsigned order, which, technically speaking, overruled an order to postpone the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s termination of TPS for Venezuela \u2013 the Supreme Court achieved what law professors believe to be the biggest instantaneous \u201cde-documentation\u201d of immigrants in U.S. history. 350,000 people who woke up on Monday with legal status in the U.S. went to bed Monday without it. Probably. We assume. The lack of clarity is maddening. But it\u2019s, in a way, the logical endpoint of the way TPS holders have always had to live their lives \u2013 18 months at a time \u2013 and of the Trump administration\u2019s insistence on pulling the rug out from under people who had filed their papers with the U.S. in exchange for permission to stay. **The Supreme Court\u2019s Legal Triple Negative** Going into the procedural details of how all of this happened will not exactly make the constant flip-flops any less confusing, but here goes: In 2023, President Biden decided that conditions in Venezuela were bad enough that it would be inappropriate to deport anyone there, and therefore Venezuelans in the United States neededTemporary Protected Status(if they lacked other legal status) to remain here legally until conditions improved. He both extended TPS for Venezuela \u2013 allowing people who had received TPS after it was first offered in 2021 to renew it for an additional 18 months, which would be added to the end of their existing TPS period \u2013 and redesignated it, allowing Venezuelans who had arrived since 2021 to apply for TPS for the first time and receive 18 months of protections. As many as 350,000people took the government up on the offer, receiving protections through April 2025. Many of them \u2013 about 67,000 \u2013 had arrived in the United States with a different form of temporary protection: they were paroled in under the Biden administration\u2019s\u201cCHNV\u201d (Cuban, Haitian, Nicaraguan and Venezuelan) program,with protections that expired after two years. Applying for TPS allowed someone whose parole was set to expire in January 2025, for example, to give themselves an extra few months, a more durable form of protection, and the potential for further extensions if the executive branch chose to give them. A few days before leaving office, the Biden administration publisheda noticethat essentially combined the 2021 and 2023 TPS timelines, and allowed both to reapply for TPS through September 2026. The Trump administration seized on this move, and moved within days of its inauguration to vacate Biden\u2019s decision; a few days later, it issuedits own proclamation, saying it would be ending TPS for the 2023-protected Venezuelans after all, and they would lose their legal status on April 7. TPS holders sued the administration over the bait-and-switch. In an order issued mere weeks before the expiration date, a federal judgeordered DHSto \u201cpostpone the effective date\u201d of its decision to end TPS for Venezuela, while the lawsuit over the legality of the decision was ongoing. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the postponement. The Supreme Court, on Monday,overturned it. So if the termination of TPS would have gone into effect already, but it was postponed, and now it\u2019s been unpostponed, that means it\u2019s implicitly already in effect\u2026right? Here\u2019s the problem: the Supreme Court didn\u2019t actually clarify whether the termination is in effect now, or whether the government has to do something to make the original April 7 termination effective. Litigators in the case say thatit\u2019s up to the government to make the next move, and announce how it is interpreting the court\u2019s order \u2013 which is to say, whether it considers all 350,000 Venezuelans to be already out of status and potentially subject to removal, or whether it\u2019s going to set a new date by which they will become so. (The litigators aren\u2019t saying that whatever the government does will be legallycorrect, just that they have to take the initiative.) As of Tuesday evening, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Serviceswebpage about TPS for Venezuelahad not been updated to reflect Monday\u2019s ruling. It still said that work permits issued to 2023 TPS holders would be auto-extended through next April \u2013 \u201cunder protest pursuant to court order.\u201d **Leaving TPS Holders To Gamble with Their Freedom** TPS holders are already in a\u201climinal status\u201dthat they can never convert to permanent residency, and every expiration date brings with it the possibility that the president won\u2019t grant another extension \u2013 underlined during Trump\u2019s first term when he tried to do just that for hundreds of thousands of people from Haiti, El Salvador, and others. Those terminations wereheld up in courtuntil President Biden took office and undid them. Telling people they would be able to plan for another 18 months of life in the United States, then telling them they had just over 60 days to leave, is a different category of arbitrariness. (Technically, the Supreme Court acknowledged, people who had already applied for and received new TPS grants between January 17 and February 5 might legally be allowed to keep them \u2013 but given the processing time for TPS applications, it is highly unlikely any such people exist.) The cruelty is especially apparent given that, in the weeks before the April 7 expiration date, TPS holders in the US saw their compatriots deported without hearings and sent to a notorious Salvadoran prison under theAlien Enemies Act\u2014 includingat least four peoplewith active TPS. The threat of detention and deportation was terrifying. The court ruling postponing the termination offered little psychological relief to Venezuelan TPS holders. One Venezuelan advocate described her state of mind this wayto Politicoin the days following the reprieve: \u201cIt\u2019s exhausting, it\u2019s disheartening, it\u2019s painful and I\u2019m not going to lie, last night I cried.\u201d The Supreme Court\u2019s order shows why they were uncomforted. What courts grant, courts can take away. Probably. We assume. Add to this the fact that some Venezuelans who have TPS may also still be within the two-year window for their CHNV parole to be valid \u2013 except that the Trump administration is trying to kill that, too. That termination hasalsobeen held up in court (for now), but the Trump administration isasking the Supreme Courtto overturn that ruling, too. A decision could come any day. The lack of clarity on the question of whether TPS has already been terminated has enormous real-world stakes. Should someone with TPS show up to work their next shift, on a work permit that was valid on Monday morning but may now be (in legal terms) six weeks past its expiration date? Should they cancel their leases and buy plane tickets, or keep studying for their final exams at school? If they are arrested, will the ICE agents accept the explanation that no one appears to know if they have valid papers or not? The strategy of this administration is to cast as broad a net of enforcement as possible \u2013 and to make it clear even to those who aren\u2019t caught up in it today that they could be caught up in it tomorrow. But the rule of law is built on certainty and predictability. A legal regime under which people can have their status taken away from them in a day, without even a clear explanation that that\u2019s happened, fully undermines both of those. A law that can\u2019t be relied on isn\u2019t a law anyone can live by. **Sign up for our weekly emails** Myths and misinformation too often dominate the immigration debate.
