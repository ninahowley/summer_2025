(Editor\u2019s note: This story was updated multiple times throughout the day with results and photos from Saturday\u2019s event.) COLUMBUS \u2014 Faith Brown of Beavercreek won an individual state title Saturday at the 2025 OHSAA State Track and Field Championships. Brown was triumphant, and dominant, in the Division I girls 300 meter hurdles final. She ran a final time of 41 seconds flat, setting a new meet record at Jesse Owens Stadium in Columbus in the process. She entered the race with the best time out of Friday\u2019s prelim heats and wasted no time speeding ahead in Saturday\u2019s final. Brown won by 1.13 seconds and was only .21 seconds off the state meet record. Six total local athletes reached the podium Saturday during day two of the OHSAA State Track and Field Championships. During the Division III competition, Cedarville\u2019s Bradyn Long finished in eighth place in the boys 300 meter hurdles final with a time of 39.76. Legacy Christian\u2019s Caroline Hamilton got seventh in the girls 3200 meter run running the race in 11:18.75. In D-II, Carroll\u2019s Ruby Gross made a late push to secure a podium spot, finishing eighth in the girls 1600 meter run by running a time of 4:56.32. Beavercreek had multiple placers in D-I. Enora McEllroy got third in both the seated girls 400 and 100 meters, and Zoe Roll finished fourth in the seated girls 100 meter dash. Brown was also the runner-up in the girls 100 meter hurdles after taking third a year ago. Jackson Davis made a surge out of the final turn to pass three others and get fourth place in the boys 1600 meter run. He later joined Aaden Hildebrand, Aiden Howard, and Gio Louprasong for an eighth place run in the boys 4 x 400 meter relay to close the meet. Beavercreek finished in a tie for ninth place in the girls team competition. Check out our Tuesday print edition for more stories and podium photos from the event.
