Generally speaking, they say that it must be a faith that has works. In light of this, many quote James 2:24 in order to argue against Romans 3:28, 4:5, Galatians 2:16, etc. They set scripture against scripture and fail to analyze contexts. Therefore, this article is a defense of justification by faith alone.I hope it helps you stand firm in the truth of God\u2019s word. Justification before God is either by faith alone or it is not by faith alone.By \u2018faith\u2019 alone is meant the belief/trust that is granted by God (Phil. 1:29) that is in Jesus (John 6:29). Because this faith is granted by God and is in Jesus, the faith is real and genuine. It is not mere mental assent. It accompanies regeneration.Phil. 1:29, \u201cFor to you it has been granted for Christ\u2019s sake, not only to believe in Him, but also to suffer for His sake.\u201dJohn 6:29, \u201cJesus answered and said to them, \u2018This is the work of God, that you believe in Him whom He has sent.'\u201dBy \u2018justification\u2019 is meant the crediting of righteousness that is received by faith (Rom. 4:5) apart from the works of the Law (Rom. 3:28; Gal. 2:16; Phil. 3:9).Rom. 4:5, \u201cBut to the one who does not work, but believes in Him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is credited as righteousness.\u201dRom. 3:28, \u201cFor we maintain that a man is justified by faith apart from works of the Law.\u201dGal. 2:16, \u201cnevertheless knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the Law but through faith in Christ Jesus, even we have believed in Christ Jesus, so that we may be justified by faith in Christ and not by the works of the Law; since by the works of the Law no flesh will be justified.\u201dPhil. 3:9, \u201cand may be found in Him, not having a righteousness of my own derived from the Law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness which comes from God on the basis of faith,\u201dNote: Roman Catholics and Eastern Orthodox often claim that the \u201cLaw\u201d in Romans 3:28, 4:5, and Galatians 2:16 refers to the ceremonial law. However, this interpretation is flawed for several reasons.First, Romans 3:20 states that \u201cthrough the Law comes the knowledge of sin.\u201d The ceremonial law does not define sin (Rom. 5:20; 1 John 3:4); it responds to it. Romans 7:7 reinforces this by citing the command \u201cYou shall not covet,\u201d which comes from the Ten Commandments (Exodus 20:17). This is moral law, not ceremonial law.Second, Rom. 3:19 says the Law makes \u201call the world accountable to God.\u201d The ceremonial law was given only to Israel and cannot universally condemn the world. Only the moral law can apply to all humanity.Third, in Rom\u2019. 4:1-5, Paul presents Abraham as the exemplar of justification by faith, and Abraham lived before the ceremonial law was instituted through Moses.Finally, Rom. 5:13-14 says, \u201csin is not imputed when there is no law,\u201d yet \u201cdeath reigned from Adam to Moses.\u201d This implies that people were still judged for sin before the ceremonial law existed; therefore, another kind of law must have been in effect besides the ceremonial law, namely the moral law. Therefore, the broader context shows that Paul\u2019s references to \u201cthe Law\u201d in these chapters cannot be restricted to the ceremonial law, but must refer to the moral law which condemns all humanity.Short:All the world is accountable to God not by the ceremonial law, but by the moral law (Rom. 3:19). It is through the moral law that we have the knowledge of sin (Rom. 3:20). Therefore it cannot be the ceremonial law that brings wrath (Rom. 4:15) since not all people had the ceremonial law. Death reigned from Adam to Moses before the ceremonial law was given, so the moral law must have been in effect (Rom. 5:13-14). Paul refers to the moral law (Rom. 7:7). So, Romans 3:28; 4:5; Gal. 2:16; Phil. 3:9, etc., cannot be about the ceremonial law.Exodus 20:17, \u201cYou shall not covet your neighbor\u2019s house; you shall not covet your neighbor\u2019s wife or his male servant or his female servant or his ox or his donkey or anything that belongs to your neighbor.\u201dRom. 3:19, \u201cNow we know that whatever the Law says, it speaks to those who are under the Law, so that every mouth may be closed and all the world may become accountable to God.\u201dRom. 3:20, \u201cbecause by the works of the Law no flesh will be justified in His sight; for through the Law comes the knowledge of sin.\u201dRom. 3:28, \u201cFor we maintain that a man is justified by faith apart from works of the Law.\u201dRom. 4:1\u20135, \u201cWhat then shall we say that Abraham, our forefather according to the flesh, has found? 2 For if Abraham was justified by works, he has something to boast about, but not before God. 3 For what does the Scripture say? \u201cAbraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness.\u201d 4 Now to the one who works, his wage is not credited as a favor, but as what is due. 5 But to the one who does not work, but believes in Him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is credited as righteousness.\u201dRom. 4:15, \u201cfor the Law brings about wrath, but where there is no law, there also is no violation.\u201dRom. 5:13\u201314, \u201cfor until the Law sin was in the world, but sin is not imputed when there is no law. 14 Nevertheless, death reigned from Adam until Moses, even over those who had not sinned in the likeness of the offense of Adam, who is a type of Him who was to come.\u201dRom. 5:20, \u201cThe Law came in so that the transgression would increase; but where sin increased, grace abounded all the more,\u201dRom. 7:7, \u201cWhat shall we say then? Is the Law sin? May it never be! On the contrary, I would not have come to know sin except through the Law; for I would not have known about coveting if the Law had not said, \u201cYou shall not covet.\u201dGal. 2:16, \u201cnevertheless knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the Law but through faith in Christ Jesus, even we have believed in Christ Jesus, so that we may be justified by faith in Christ and not by the works of the Law; since by the works of the Law no flesh will be justified.\u201dPhil. 3:9, \u201cand may be found in Him, not having a righteousness of my own derived from the Law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness which comes from God on the basis of faith,\u201d1 John 3:4, \u201cEveryone who practices sin also practices lawlessness; and sin is lawlessness.\u201d By \u2018faith\u2019 alone is meant the belief/trust that is granted by God (Phil. 1:29) that is in Jesus (John 6:29). Because this faith is granted by God and is in Jesus, the faith is real and genuine. It is not mere mental assent.

However, this interpretation is flawed for several reasons.First, Romans 3:20 states that \u201cthrough the Law comes the knowledge of sin.\u201d The ceremonial law does not define sin (Rom. 5:20; 1 John 3:4); it responds to it. Romans 7:7 reinforces this by citing the command \u201cYou shall not covet,\u201d which comes from the Ten Commandments (Exodus 20:17). This is moral law, not ceremonial law.Second, Rom. 3:19 says the Law makes \u201call the world accountable to God.\u201d The ceremonial law was given only to Israel and cannot universally condemn the world. Only the moral law can apply to all humanity.Third, in Rom\u2019. 4:1-5, Paul presents Abraham as the exemplar of justification by faith, and Abraham lived before the ceremonial law was instituted through Moses.Finally, Rom. 5:13-14 says, \u201csin is not imputed when there is no law,\u201d yet \u201cdeath reigned from Adam to Moses.\u201d This implies that people were still judged for sin before the ceremonial law existed; therefore, another kind of law must have been in effect besides the ceremonial law, namely the moral law. Therefore, the broader context shows that Paul\u2019s references to \u201cthe Law\u201d in these chapters cannot be restricted to the ceremonial law, but must refer to the moral law which condemns all humanity. Short:All the world is accountable to God not by the ceremonial law, but by the moral law (Rom. 3:19). It is through the moral law that we have the knowledge of sin (Rom. 3:20). Therefore it cannot be the ceremonial law that brings wrath (Rom. 4:15) since not all people had the ceremonial law. Death reigned from Adam to Moses before the ceremonial law was given, so the moral law must have been in effect (Rom. 5:13-14). Paul refers to the moral law (Rom. 7:7). So, Romans 3:28; 4:5; Gal. 2:16; Phil. 3:9, etc., cannot be about the ceremonial law.Exodus 20:17, \u201cYou shall not covet your neighbor\u2019s house; you shall not covet your neighbor\u2019s wife or his male servant or his female servant or his ox or his donkey or anything that belongs to your neighbor.\u201dRom. 3:19, \u201cNow we know that whatever the Law says, it speaks to those who are under the Law, so that every mouth may be closed and all the world may become accountable to God.\u201dRom. 3:20, \u201cbecause by the works of the Law no flesh will be justified in His sight; for through the Law comes the knowledge of sin.\u201dRom. 3:28, \u201cFor we maintain that a man is justified by faith apart from works of the Law.\u201dRom. 4:1\u20135, \u201cWhat then shall we say that Abraham, our forefather according to the flesh, has found? 2 For if Abraham was justified by works, he has something to boast about, but not before God. 3 For what does the Scripture say? \u201cAbraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness.\u201d 4 Now to the one who works, his wage is not credited as a favor, but as what is due. 5 But to the one who does not work, but believes in Him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is credited as righteousness.\u201dRom. 4:15, \u201cfor the Law brings about wrath, but where there is no law, there also is no violation.\u201dRom. 5:13\u201314, \u201cfor until the Law sin was in the world, but sin is not imputed when there is no law. 14 Nevertheless, death reigned from Adam until Moses, even over those who had not sinned in the likeness of the offense of Adam, who is a type of Him who was to come.\u201dRom. 5:20, \u201cThe Law came in so that the transgression would increase; but where sin increased, grace abounded all the more,\u201dRom. 7:7, \u201cWhat shall we say then?

This is a true dichotomy.A true dichotomy is when there are only two possibilities. So, our justification is by the faith that God grants us alone or is not the case that is by the faith that God grants us alone.James 2:24, \u201cYou see that a man is justified by works and not by faith alone.\u201dThe context of James 2:24 begins in verse 14, where James talks about a faith that has no works, and he says, \u201cCan that faith save him?\u201d What faith? The faith that is dead (ascentia \u2013 mental acknowledgment), v. 17. Furthermore, James is talking about works presented to people, not before God, because in verse 18 he says, \u201cShow me your faith without the works, and I will show you my faith by my works.\u201d This is dealing with the horizontal, that is, between people. This is talking about justification before people, not before God. James declares that even the demons have faith (v. 19). He again is mentioning false faith; that is, faith that has no true manifestation of good works. V. 21 is where Paul says Abraham was justified by works. Now, no Roman Catholic would say that works justify before God. Paul, of course, contradicts that as well (Rom. 3:28; 4:5, etc.) Again, since this is about justification before people, not before God (v. 18) as is consistent with other Scriptures (Rom. 3:28; 4:1-5; Gal. 2:16, 21), we can then understand that the works that James is talking about are not works that save you or contribute to salvation, but works that are the manifestation of true faith (fiducia \u2013 heartfelt faith and trust). Furthermore, when it says that \u201ca man it is justified by works and not by faith alone, the context is justification before people (v. 18), not before God (Rom. 4:1-5). In other words, \u201cshow me your faith without the works, and I will show you my faith by my works\u201d (James 2:18). So, James is consistent with the rest of Scripture. All you need to do is look at the context.In light of this, many people appeal to James 2:24 to state that justification before God is by works, and not faith alone.Furthermore, if they use James 2:24 as a statement in support of their position that works and faith save, then,from their perspective, they must be consistent and say that their justification before God is by works, as the text says, and not by faith alone. So then, do they agree that they are justified before God by their works of faith and good works? They would have to say that works justify us before God, along with our faith. But that, of course, contradicts what is clearly taught above in point 1. For more on this, see the CARM article \u201cAre we justified by faith (Romans) or by works (James)?\u201c A true dichotomy is when there are only two possibilities. So, our justification is by the faith that God grants us alone or is not the case that is by the faith that God grants us alone.James 2:24, \u201cYou see that a man is justified by works and not by faith alone.\u201dThe context of James 2:24 begins in verse 14, where James talks about a faith that has no works, and he says, \u201cCan that faith save him?\u201d What faith? The faith that is dead (ascentia \u2013 mental acknowledgment), v. 17. Furthermore, James is talking about works presented to people, not before God, because in verse 18 he says, \u201cShow me your faith without the works, and I will show you my faith by my works.\u201d This is dealing with the horizontal, that is, between people. This is talking about justification before people, not before God. James declares that even the demons have faith (v. 19). He again is mentioning false faith; that is, faith that has no true manifestation of good works. V. 21 is where Paul says Abraham was justified by works. Now, no Roman Catholic would say that works justify before God. Paul, of course, contradicts that as well (Rom. 3:28; 4:5, etc.) Again, since this is about justification before people, not before God (v. 18) as is consistent with other Scriptures (Rom. 3:28; 4:1-5; Gal. 2:16, 21), we can then understand that the works that James is talking about are not works that save you or contribute to salvation, but works that are the manifestation of true faith (fiducia \u2013 heartfelt faith and trust). Furthermore, when it says that \u201ca man it is justified by works and not by faith alone, the context is justification before people (v. 18), not before God (Rom. 4:1-5). In other words, \u201cshow me your faith without the works, and I will show you my faith by my works\u201d (James 2:18). So, James is consistent with the rest of Scripture. All you need to do is look at the context.In light of this, many people appeal to James 2:24 to state that justification before God is by works, and not faith alone. James 2:24, \u201cYou see that a man is justified by works and not by faith alone.\u201d The context of James 2:24 begins in verse 14, where James talks about a faith that has no works, and he says, \u201cCan that faith save him?\u201d What faith?

Furthermore, if they use James 2:24 as a statement in support of their position that works and faith save, then,from their perspective, they must be consistent and say that their justification before God is by works, as the text says, and not by faith alone. So then, do they agree that they are justified before God by their works of faith and good works? They would have to say that works justify us before God, along with our faith. But that, of course, contradicts what is clearly taught above in point 1.

For more on this, see the CARM article \u201cAre we justified by faith (Romans) or by works (James)?\u201c **Roman Catholic documentation** Heaven is a reward for good works\u201cIn every circumstance, each one of us should hope, with the grace of God, to persevere \u2018to the end\u2019 andto obtain the joy of heaven, as God\u2019s eternal reward for the good works accomplished with the grace of Christ\u201d(Catechism of the Catholic Church 1821). Attain salvation through commandments\u201c\u2026the mission of teaching all peoples, and of preaching the Gospel to every creature, sothat all men may attain salvation through faith, Baptism and the observance of the Commandments\u201d(CCC 2068). Keeping the 10 commandments is necessary for salvation\u201cThe authority of the Magisterium extends also tothe specific precepts of the natural law [i.e., 10 Commandments, CCC 2070], because their observance, demanded by the Creator, is necessary for salvation\u201d(CCC 2036). **Eastern Orthodoxy documentation** Not by faith alone, but through faith and works\u201cWe believe a man to be not simply justified through faith alone, but through faith which works through love, that is to say, through faith and works.But [the idea] that faith can fulfill the function of a hand that lays hold on the righteousness which is in Christ, and can then apply it unto us for salvation, we know to be far from all Orthodoxy\u2026we rather believe that it is not the correlative of faith, but the faith which is in us, justifies through works\u201d (Confession of Dositheus, 1672, Decree 13). Salvation by persevering in faith and good works\u201cTo wit, thatif we persevere with constancy in faith and good works, we shall finally become partakers of salvation and eternal life.(Confession of Mogila, 1642, Part 1, Question 101). Good works are necessary to save your soul.\u201cWhat is necessary in order to please God and to save one\u2019s own soul? In the first place, a knowledge of the true God, and a right faith in him; in the second place, a life according to faith,and good works.\u201d(Longer Catechism Q. 3, pravoslavieto.com/docs/eng/Orthodox_Catechism_of_Philaret.htm) **Related Articles** Go to the Doctrine and Theology main page What are the core beliefs of Christianity?
