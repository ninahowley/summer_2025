In a final planned press conference as Oakland schools superintendent, Kyla Johnson-Trammell talked about bringing the district back from the brink of insolvency, raising graduation and academic achievement rates, fostering millions of dollars in philanthropic support, and what\u2019s on the horizon for the next district leader. One topic she refrained from discussing was the circumstances around her early departure. Thursday was the last day of school in Oakland Unified School District, and marked the end of Johnson-Trammell\u2019s last academic year as superintendent. In August, shesigned an extensionthat would\u2019ve lasted through 2027, but about a month ago, the OUSD boardannounced a separation agreementwith the superintendent. She will be stepping down from that role on June 30.

The financial turnaround marked her tenure. When she became superintendent in 2017, the district had reserves lower than the 2% required by the state. They have now grown to over 15%, she said. But in order to remain on that path, the district\u2019s next leader must consider closing schools. \u201cWe have absolutely no reason to be in fiscal crisis ever again, right? And part of making sure that\u2019s possible is we have to reduce the number of schools,\u201d Johnson-Trammell said. \u201cThat is not an option to not do that. Is it painful? Yes. Does it need to be done with the community? Yes. Do we need to make sure we\u2019re not putting undue harm on Black and brown and immigrant families? Yes. But keeping things the way they are is hurting those communities.\u201d Under her leadership, OUSD\u2019s graduation rate has risen from 70% to 79%, the college completion rate has increased by 14%, and the share of students graduating who are eligible to enroll in the state\u2019s public four-year colleges has grown from 35% to 50%, she said. Along with media, district administrators, current and former school board members, and community leaders were also in the room. Johnson-Trammell gave her remarks from the district\u2019s new West Oakland headquarters, which following Wednesday night\u2019s school board meeting, has been named the Marcus A. Foster Leadership Center. Oakland\u2019s first Black superintendent and among the first Black superintendents of any urban school district, Foster is a revered educator who championed student success, especially for students of color. He was assassinated by the Symbionese Liberation Army in 1973. \u201cIt\u2019s a fitting tribute to a remarkable leader and a leader who definitely shaped my leadership journey here, both as an educator and as a superintendent,\u201d Johnson-Trammell said. \u201cIt has been an honor to serve the district that has raised me, both as a student and an educator. Today is not an ending. It is simply a handoff grounded in gratitude and an unshakeable belief in what Oakland will accomplish next.\u201d The headquarters were built with Measure Y dollars, a $735 million facilities bond that Oakland voters approved in 2020 and has gone towards renovations at several school campuses. The school board is expected to name an interim superintendent to step in on July 1, and then begin a search for a permanent superintendent. Johnson-Trammell will remain in an advisory role as superintendent emeritus from July 1 to January 15, 2026. When asked, she declined to go into detail about her exit, stating: \u201cWe have to be aligned in terms of what it takes to continue to sustain financial stability, to get to the academic outcomes that I\u2019ve talked about in great detail. So if we\u2019re not on the same page, then it\u2019s time to respectfully part ways.\u201d Johnson-Trammell emphasized that the community must take an active role in the search and hiring of the next superintendent. \u201cI have faith that folks will do whatever coalition building they need to hold the board accountable the same way they held me accountable for eight years. That\u2019s their role.\u201d **\u2026 We rely on your support** Hey, we know that most readers only scan a headline and a couple of paragraphs. Thank you for reading to the end of our story.
