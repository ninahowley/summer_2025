HARRISBURG \u2014 President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cbig, beautiful\u201d budget bill could have a disastrous effect on the health of rural Pennsylvanians and the operations of the hospitals and other medical centers that care for them. Thefederal budget proposal, which passed the U.S. House by aone-vote marginin May, calls for nearly $800 billion inMedicaid cuts over the next decade. It alsoincludesa new 80-hour-per-month work or service requirement for Medicaid recipients between the ages of 19 and 64 who aren\u2019t caregivers or who have disabilities. Among other changes, the bill would require verification of coverage eligibility every six months rather than annually. While supporters of the budget bill argue that it would slow spending and safeguard government programs, critics say the cuts andnew requirementswould create more paperwork for states and make it harder to access essential care. Opponents also argue the changes would push struggling rural hospitals and other providers to the brink, and force them to scale back services or close entirely. More than 3 million people in Pennsylvania \u2014 23% \u2014 are covered by Medicaid, according todatafrom the state Department of Human Services, which administers the program. The agency estimates that more than 300,000 would lose Medicaid coverage under the proposal. Val Arkoosh, secretary of the department, said the bill would not only hurt those losing coverage but \u201call of us who would face the real-life consequences of crowded emergency departments, increases in the cost of health insurance, and the catastrophic effects on economies and health systems in rural areas.\u201d More than 737,000 Medicaid recipients live in rural counties, where residents are typically older and more reliant on government-funded insurance programs. Such programs reimburse at lower rates compared with private insurance companies and haven\u2019t kept up with inflation. Cameron County Commissioner James Moate, a Republican, said the Medicaid reimbursement rate should have never been less than 100%. \u201cThat\u2019s why we have struggling hospitals,\u201d he told Spotlight PA. On average, Pennsylvania hospitals absorb a loss of 18 cents on the dollar for care provided to Medicaid patients, said Nicole Stallings, president and CEO of the Hospital and Healthsystem Association of Pennsylvania, which represents more than 230 hospitals statewide. In rural communities, the average loss is 26 cents on the dollar, she added in aMay statement. \u201cMedicaid plays a vital role in the health of rural residents, and it is important to preserve this funding so that families can continue to access the care they need for healthier lives,\u201d said Douglas Winner, chief financial officer for Penn Highlands Healthcare, a nonprofit system with nine hospitals in rural counties. Penn Highlands President and CEO Steve Fontaine has told lawmakers that consolidating with other health systems and expanding into new areas has helped facilities survive. This strategy, which has helped Penn Highlands diversify its patient and insurance bases, is why the system expanded into Centre County, where resident numbers are expected to grow, he told lawmakerslast year. Still, the health system hasshuttered servicesand reportedoperating lossesover the past year. Winner said Penn Highlands is \u201cgreatly concerned\u201d about the proposed Medicaid cuts. \u201cRural hospitals have experienced substantial cost increases for labor, drugs, and supplies,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cCoupled with decreasing volumes, inadequate reimbursement rates, and ongoing staffing shortages \u2014 recruitment and retention \u2014 we are struggling financially.\u201d Advocates worry the cuts in the federal budget will force rural hospitals to slash services even more or close altogether. And once facilities end a service or shut down, they rarely reopen, Stallings told Spotlight PA. Community health centers could also be strained. These facilities, also known as federally qualified health centers, provide services regardless of someone\u2019s ability to pay and primarily see patients who use Medicaid and PENNIE, the state\u2019s Affordable Care Act marketplace. More uninsured people will likely lead to an increase in uncompensated care, said Eric Kiehl, director of policy and partnership for the Pennsylvania Association of Community Health Centers. And these facilities are already strapped for resources, he told Spotlight PA. A surge in demand could cause these health centers to shutter core services \u2014 such as medical, dental or behavioral health \u2014 reduce hours or close, Kiehl said. Pennsylvania\u2019s U.S. House delegationvotedalong party lines on the federal budget bill, with Republicans supporting and Democrats opposing the proposal. Medicaid spending totaled roughly$44 billionin fiscal year 2023. The federal government provided almost $28 billion of those dollars. Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro has said the state won\u2019t be able to make up those dollars to support the Medicaid program. In a statement, Shapiro said he hopes \u201ccommon sense and a concern for the people of Pennsylvania\u201d will prevail in the U.S. Senate, where Democratic U.S. Sen. John Fetterman and Republican U.S. Sen. Dave McCormick disagree on aspects of the bill. McCormick did not respond to a request for comment for this story. He hasexpressed supportfor the budget bill, which he says would reduce and slow government spending. During aFox News forum, McCormick said he isn\u2019t advocating for taking benefits from \u201cvulnerable people\u201d but is trying to ensure \u201cpeople for whom the program was designed\u201d benefit. Fetterman called the plan \u201ca bad bill,\u201d telling Spotlight PA in a statement: \u201cRepublicans want to put more money in the pockets of the ultra-rich at the expense of hundreds of thousands of Pennsylvanians who will lose access to Medicaid if this disastrous bill is passed.\u201d SUPPORT THIS JOURNALISMand help us reinvigorate local news in north-central Pennsylvania atspotlightpa.org/donate.
