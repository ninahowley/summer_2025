New Quinnipiac Poll on Dem Party Approval Delivers Some BRUTAL News** It's time to check in and see how the Democratic Party is doing when it comes to public approval after spending the last several weeks going to the mat to keep criminal illegals in the country and insisting that men should be able to compete in women's sports. How crazy have the Dems gotten? This crazy: LA MAYOR: The looting of the Nike store was \"provoked by the White House.\"pic.twitter.com/cObTZ5sQkC These Democrats have reached \"Trump enforcing immigration laws has caused law-abiding people to loot a Nike store\" levels of deranged. It's showing up in the polls as well. A new Quinnipiac survey has some news that shows the Dem Party is on the right path... as far as the Republican Party is concerned: Democratic Party Approval Rating\ud83d\udfe2 Approve: 21% (-49)\ud83d\udd34 Disapprove: 70%Quinnipiac | June 5-9 | 1,283 RVpic.twitter.com/akG3iBTiDm You know what the Dems' problem is? They haven't had enough margaritas with illegal aliens and made Tim Walz and Jasmine Crockett the faces of their party nearly aggressively enough.
