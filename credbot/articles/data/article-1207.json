As censorship and book bans continue to rise across the United States,a new blog seriesfrom Sage features nine academic librarian thought leaders address how they navigate current challenges. Librarians play a vital role in teaching, learning, and research across educational landscapes, and Sage recognizes them as crucial arbiters of knowledge. In this series, collected in 2024, our writers call on their colleagues, coworkers, and the public to protect the freedom to read and learn. Offering insights into the current climate and the future of scholarship, the librarians responded to the following questions: Why is academic freedom so important? How do you think book bans and other forms of censorship in higher education and books will impact the future of scholarship, research, learning? How will it impact librarians more specifically? What do you want your colleagues in higher ed to know and what can they do to help? Their responses highlighted the importance of inclusivity, support, and collective action. \u201cFellow academics,\u201d writes contributor Amanda Bosch, \u201crally and support academic freedom and library initiatives!
