In such a heightened situation, McGhee says that a lack of communication between agencies can create a dangerous situation. \u201cTypically, when you have outside resources into a municipality, that is a coordinated response from the level of the governor\u2019s office. It appears that White House had deployed these troops as an unwelcomed resource. This could be problematic on the ground, because you don\u2019t have proper coordination. Anytime you have an incident like this, there\u2019s always Incident Command to allow the responding agencies to coordinate,\u201d McGhee said. \u201cWhenever you have any type of conflicting objective, that\u2019s an opportunity for a disaster. So, hopefully cooler heads will prevail, allow Governor [Gavin] Newsom to make those decisions moving forward, and allow different agencies at municipal, state, and county level to be able to coordinate and work together and to be able to bring some type of quell to the rioting that\u2019s happening,\u201d he continued. McGhee says people have a right to assemble, as long as it is done safely. (Copyright (c) 2024 Sunbeam Television. All Rights Reserved.
