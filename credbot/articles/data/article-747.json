Medicaid Watch ACA Marketplaces Global Health\u2019s Future Home Newsroom How the Trump Administration and Congress Are Reshaping the Affordable Care Act's\u2026 **How the Trump Administration and Congress Are Reshaping the Affordable Care Act\u2019s Marketplaces: Views from the States** Published:Jun 11, 2025 Through regulations and the House budget reconciliation bill, significant changes are being considered by Congress and the Trump Administration for how the Affordable Care Act\u2019s health insurance Marketplaces would work. At the same time, the enhanced tax credits that have made Marketplace coverage more affordable and driven record enrollment are set to expire at the end of the year unless extended by Congress. To examine how these changes could reshape the ACA\u2019s Marketplaces, KFF held a virtual briefing on June 11 featuring leaders from two state-based Marketplaces to get perspectives from the field. The briefing examined the Trump administration\u2019s administrative changes; the ACA provisions in the House-passed reconciliation bill; the expected impact on Marketplace premiums and what consumers could pay out of pocket; the potential impact on federal spending and fraud, waste, and abuse; and how the changes could affect enrollment and the number of people uninsured. Participants included: Michele Eberle, executive director of the Maryland Health Benefit Exchange Pat Kelly, executive director of Your Health Idaho Cynthia Cox, KFF vice president and director of its Program on the ACA Larry Levitt, KFF Executive Vice President for Health Policy Affordable Care Act Marketplaces State Level Affordability Coverage **Event Materials** Slides Transcript **Also of Interest** Tracking the Affordable Care Act Provisions in the 2025 Reconciliation Bill Congressional District Interactive Map: How Much Will ACA Premium Payments Rise if Enhanced Subsidies Expire?
