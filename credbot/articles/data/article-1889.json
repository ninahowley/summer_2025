it\u2019s called THE INTERNET, and it\u2019schock-full of queer-owned businesses who have designed and produced their very own t-shirtsthat you could potentially purchase for yourself and wear to a Pride celebration or really anywhere t-shirts are worn. Plus, these indies have also been known to produce social justice and LGBTQ+ apparel that goes beyond straight-up rainbows! Imagine that. Last year, a lot of shops from the year before had to be removed because they\u2019d shut down or didn\u2019t have anything in stock. Meanwhile on Etsy,in line with etsy trends already acknowledged across the entire platform, the carefully-curated maker-centric stores are getting drowned out by massive, print-on-demand shirt-makers (print-on-demand is a less risky and more efficient \u2014 but less profitable on a price-per-item basis \u2014way to sell merchandise) who, rather than developing an intentional line of designs are just throwing 200 slogans out there and seeing what sticks. This isn\u2019t a criticism of the makers themselves, but of the way the indie queer merch-schilling market has evolved into one where it\u2019s not profitable to do it any other way. Those of us who have bothered to create original designs have long given up on trying to control the massive amount of copycat makers out there, too. Which is just to say \u2014if you can, don\u2019t buy your Pride Tees from Target or from straight people or CustomTrendyShirts or HappyCustomTee, buy them from the queer people acknowledged in this post. If you are a writer using this list as a reference tool to write your own list of queer-owned businesses for a mainstream (not queer) website or a website that makes more money than we do, we would very much appreciate it if you couldinclude our storeor credit our list! This post was originally written in 2017 and has been updated for 2025. **Autostraddle: Our #1 Most Favorite Queer-Owned Business** Up top is our #1 most favorite queer-owned business store on the entire internet even though we haven\u2019t made any new shirts since 2023. Regardless, there is no other store in the world that will make you as happy as theAutostraddle store.The people who you support by shopping at the Autostraddle Store are some of the best people to have ever existed in the world! Wow, where do I begin? All these shirts look great on a body that contains a head that contains a face that is pretty bummed about Wells Fargo sponsoring Pride. Many of the slogans that are now common on queer tees, like the \u201cGal Pal\u201d t-shirt, were pioneered right here on Autostraddle! I could go on and on because there are so many shirts from Autostraddle that will pop at Pride, but you can make your own choices! **Ash & Chess** Ash & Chess is a joyful, eye-popping stationary shop run by a queer and trans couple in Richmond, VA. They \u201ccreate greeting cards and art prints that are bold, retro color palettes and they often use their artwork to make a political statement and to uplift the queer community.\u201d Their t-shirt selection encourages all to support trans kids and reminds people that all bodies are good bodies and boys do cry. **Flavnt** FLAVNT Streetwear is an independent clothing brand based in Austin, Texas created with \u201cthe goal of creating clothes that promote confidence and pride.\u201d They sell binders, stickers and sweats and run fundraisers for organizations like Black Lives Matter as well as individual trans people who need money for surgery. Flavnt\u2019s LGBTQ+ relevant t-shirt selection is pretty vast, ranging from a \u201cHot Trans Boy Summer\u201d to \u201cWill Bottom For Femmes.\u201d **AngiePeaon etsy** Angie is a self-identified \u201cqueer, neurodivergent woman of color\u201d who hopes her shirts can show people in her community that feel forgotten that they\u2019re not alone \u2014they\u2019re loved and they\u2019re safe and they belong. She has hundreds of designs across social justice movements, including nearly 200 for queer causes specifically. **Culture Flock** Missouri-based apparel, accessories and gifts store Culture Flock designs and creates colorful and inclusive apparel, goods, and accessories for friends of every shape, size, color, gender, and orientation. **March for the Movementon etsy** Selling \u201csoft tees for loud voices,\u201d this LGBTQ-owened, AAPI-owned business focused on creating high-quality apparel that aims to empower its wearers to make a statement and raise social awareness. Their IYKYK scissoring tarot lesbian pride shirt is a winner, and this year they\u2019ve added shirts on topics such as gender affirming health care saving lives! **heycolandaon etsy** based in Illinois, heycolanda describe themselves as \u201ca couple of queers who do screen-printed things.\u201d These \u201clesbian starter kit\u201d tees are very cute I think. **A Tribe Called Queer** Created by Black, Indigenous hard femme Sabine Maxine Lopez; a Tribe Called Queer is a multidisciplinary brand featuring gender-netural and size-inclusive clothing as well as a podcast, zine, virtual events and a blog.
