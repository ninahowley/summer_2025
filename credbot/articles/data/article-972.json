At the same time, a senior US military official emphasised the importance of maintaining relations with Pakistan, citing its military\u2019s role in countering the Islamic State \u2013 Khorasan Province (IS-KP). State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said on Tuesday that Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau \u201cmet with the Indian parliamentary delegation last week, and he also reaffirmed the United States\u2019 strong support for India in the fight against terrorism, and the strategic partnership between the two countries.\u201d The multi-party delegation, led by Congress MP Shashi Tharoor, visited Washington as part of India\u2019s global outreach campaign followingOperation Sindoor. India launched this operation in response to the Pahalgam terror attack on April 22, which claimed 26 lives. Meanwhile, during aHouse Armed Services Committee hearing, General Michael Kurilla,chief of US Central Command, described Pakistan as \u201cphenomenal partner\u201d in counter-terrorism efforts. He highlighted Pakistan\u2019s military and Army Chief Asim Munir for their work against IS-KP. \u201cThe actions of our Pakistani partners that led to the arrest and extradition of Mohammad Sharifullah, the IS-K planner behind the August 26, 2021 suicide attack at Abbey Gate that killed 13 US service members and approximately 160 civilians, underscore Pakistan\u2019s value in countering global terror threats,\u201d Kurilla said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we need to maintain relationships with both Pakistan and India. I do not believe it\u2019s a binary choice, you can\u2019t choose one at the expense of the other,\u201d he added. \u201cWe should evaluate these relationships based on their merits.\u201d Bruce also confirmed that a Pakistani parliamentary delegation, led by Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, met with State Department officials, including Under Secretary for Political Affairs Allison Hooker, during their Washington visit. Hooker reiterated US support for the ongoing cessation of hostilities between India and Pakistan and emphasized discussions on counterterrorism cooperation. When asked whether Pakistan had committed to taking action against terrorists, Bruce declined to provide specifics about the conversation. Responding to a question aboutPresident Donald Trumpoffering to mediate on Kashmir, Bruce said, \u201cI can\u2019t speak to what\u2019s on his mind or his plans. What I do know is that President Trump has consistently aimed to resolve generational conflicts between countries. While I can\u2019t discuss details of any plans, it wouldn\u2019t surprise anyone that he would be interested in addressing a conflict like that.\u201d She described the current moment as \u201ca very exciting time\u201d for potential progress. India, however, has rejected any third-party mediation regarding Jammu and Kashmir, maintaining that the region is and will remain an integral part of the country.
