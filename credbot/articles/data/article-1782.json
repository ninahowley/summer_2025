The Party for Socialism and Liberation(PSL) \u2014 which openly calls for revolution to bring down the current American system and which publicly sympathizes with murderous Communist regimes \u2014 has been a leader in organizing and fueling anti-ICE demonstrations in LA as well as in other cities nationwide. President Donald Trump activated elements of the California National Guard to help quell the anti-ICE violence in Los Angeles. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Marines stationed at Camp Pendleton are being deployed \u201cto restore order\u201d as well. First Amendment or a right to riot? \u201cStop the raids! National Guard OUT of LA!\u201d PSLsaidin a lengthy Sunday statement. \u201cThe National Guard deployment is a desperate attempt to intimidate people out of exercising their First Amendment rights. If they can get away with it in Los Angeles, then that will only embolden the Trump administration to use greater and greater repressive force all across the country, against any expression of dissent regardless of the issue in question. For those who believe in immigrant rights, for those who believe in democracy, for the entire working class \u2014 now is the time to take to the streets in protest!\u201d \u201cIf I didn\u2019t \u2018SEND IN THE TROOPS\u2019 to Los Angeles the last three nights, that once beautiful and great City would be burning to the ground right now,\u201d Trumpsaidon his Truth Social account on Tuesday. PSL has also been running a\u201cDon\u2019t Open for ICE\u201dcampaign in both English and Spanish, which says, \u201cDon\u2019t let Trump and ICE win without a fight! Papers or not, everyone has certain rights they can use when an agent is trying to deport them. We are workers with dignity and we deserve to stay where we are.\u201d The leadership and activities of PSL are closely tied to far-left groups bolstered by the financial network ofwealthy Marxist businessmanNeville Roy Singham, whosoldhis ThoughtWorks tech company in 2017 and has used the money to fund openly Communist endeavors globally. A communist \u201cincubator\u201d Singham has been described as a \u201ccomrade\u201d of \u2014 and is a financial backer of \u2014the People\u2019s Forum, a Marxist revolutionary group based in New York City. The group calls itself \u201ca movement incubator for working class and marginalized communities to build unity across historic lines of division at home and abroad.\u201d That incubation has been integral to backing the illegal Columbia University encampments and the protests for Mahmoud Khalil, asJust the Newsdetailed inmultipleextensive investigative reports.The forum and PSL share a number of connections. Singham has also financially backed a number of other Marxist groups with links to PSL. \u201cWe are united in our belief that capitalism \u2014 the system in which all wealth and power is held by a tiny group of billionaires and their state \u2014 is the source of the main problems confronting humanity today,\u201d PSLsayson their website. \u201cIt must be replaced by socialism.\u201d PSL did not respond to a request for comment fromJust the News. Singham did not respond to a request for comment sent to him byJust the Newsthrough his ThoughtWorks company website. The PSLsaysit has dozens of chapters nationwide \u2014 and it has activated them to combat the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to crack down on illegal immigration. PSL and the violent riots in Los Angeles PSL played akey rolein organizing some of LA\u2019s anti-ICE protests and demonstrations this weekend. Photographs taken by theLos Angeles Timesshowsome of the signs waved by protesters were reportedly produced by PSL. \u201cThe people of Los Angeles and surrounding areas have taken a courageous stand against Trump\u2019s reign of terror targeting immigrant families. In response, the administration has falsely labeled those taking to the streets in protest of the brutal war on immigrants as \u2018rioters\u2019 and called in thousands of National Guard soldiers for a crackdown,\u201d PSL said in along screedon Monday. \u201cBut the people are not deterred \u2014 in Los Angeles and across the country, protest is continuing with even more determination. This could be a turning point where the entire working class unites to push back Trump\u2019s efforts to shred our basic rights and dignity.\u201d The Communist group hadtweetedon Friday that \u201cthousands march in Los Angeles against a blitz of multiple ICE raids\u201d and included video of the demonstration. PSLtweetedon Sunday about \u201cMASS MOBILIZATION. ICE OUT OF LA. NATIONAL GUARD GO AWAY.\u201d It then organized a demonstration that day outside LA City Hall. The groupthensharednumerousvideosof the anti-ICE rallies across the city, with numerous captions putting PSL\u2019s slant on the day\u2019s events: \u201cThe people continue to righteously stand up for justice for immigrant communities in the face of growing state repression! \u2026 Thousands in Los Angeles have made clear that they will continue to stand up for immigrant families against deportations, even in the face of growing repression! \u2026 Thousands have taken the highway and halted traffic in LA to send the Trump administration a powerful message that the people demand an end to the war being waged on immigrant communities. \u2026 Cops in full riot gear deployed against protesters in LA demanding an end to deportations.\u201d PSL continued its efforts on Monday,tweetingthat \u201cthousands are rallying in downtown LA against ICE, as the agency continues to terrorize the people of Los Angeles, kidnapping our neighbors, friends and families.\u201d PSL also leads anti-ICE protests elsewhere PSL has also organized, hosted, or participated in multiple other anti-ICE protests and demonstrations elsewhere in California \u2014 includingSan Francisco,Sacramento, andFresno\u2014 and across the country. On its social media accounts, PSL touted such anti-ICE demonstrations held in the Texas cities ofAustinandHouston; in the Ohio cities ofClevelandandColumbus; inProvidence, Rhode Island; inChicago, Illinois; and inWashington, DC. It wasreportedbyBreitbart Newsthat PSL organized an anti-ICE protest in San Antonio, Texas \u2014 and the outlet \u201cnoted the signs provided and carried by PSL members in San Antonio were identical to those held by PSL members in the Los Angeles demonstrations.\u201d Media outlets have noted PSL\u2019s role in other anti-ICE protests in Texas, including inDallas,Waco, andSan Antonio. The media has also reported on PSL\u2019s role in such demonstrations inLouisville,Kentucky, andRaleigh, North Carolina.PSL said on Instagram that it was planning demonstrations inRichmond, Virginialater this week. The group is also reportedly planning an anti-ICE rally inAnchorage,Alaskathis weekend. The Marxist group also issued a lengthy statement on Monday criticizing the broad sweep of the illegal immigration crackdown \u2014 dubbedOperation Tidal Wave\u2014 carried out by ICE in coordination with Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-Fla.). \u201cI\u2019ve insisted that Florida be the tip of the spear when it comes to state support of federal immigration enforcement,\u201d DeSantissaidin May. \u201cThe success of Operation Tidal Wave is proof of our commitment.\u201d PSL was not pleased. PSL\u2019s ties to the CCP-linked funding network exposed PSL is closely tied to a number of groups which are part of Neville Singham\u2019s funding network, including theMarxist-orientedPeople\u2019s Forum, thefar-leftBreakThrough Newsmedia outlet, and Singham\u2019s Justice and Education Fund. The Network Contagion Research Institute (NCRI), whichsaysits platform plays a \u201ccritical role in the identification and forecasting of emerging threats\u201d to the U.S.,assessedlast year that PSL \u201cshares considerable fiscal and personnel connections\u201d with \u201cmembers of the \u2018Singham Network\u2019 donor portfolio.\u201d The People\u2019s Forum is aMarxist revolutionary groupthat is pro-Communism, pro-China, and anti-Israel. The group has produced dozens of what it describes as teaching materials, many of them pro-CCP. The forumtaggedPSL on Twitter in March in a post about upcoming protests on \u201cAll Out for Mahmoud Khalil\u201d and \u201cShut It Down For Palestine.\u201d The NCRIarguedlast year that 2024 the People\u2019s Forum is \u201cclosely allied\u201d with PSL. Brian Becker isreportedlya \u201cfounding member\u201d of PSL as well as a national organizer for the far-left ANSWER Coalition. He is also listed as an\u201cinstructor\u201don the People\u2019s Forum website, where he has taught classes on \u201cLenin and the Path to Revolution\u201d and the \u201cHistory of theCommunist Manifesto.\u201d \u201cWhat part of Marx\u2019s diagnosis of capitalism is not correct?\u201d Beckerasked rhetoricallyon Twitter in 2023. Becker\u2019s X accountdescribes himas \u201cDirector @answercoalition [ANSWER Coalition], a founder of @pslweb [the Party for Socialism and Liberation], and show host of @TheSocProgram [the Socialist Program].\u201d The Heritage Foundationassessedin 2024 that \u201canother Singham-funded group, ANSWER, is a front operation for the Party for Socialism and Liberation.\u201d Marxist leader Claudia De La Cruz said in a2024 interviewabout her campaign as the PSL nominee to be U.S. president that \u201cI co-founded and co-directed \u2026 the People\u2019s Forum.\u201d The forumsaysthat De la Cruz \u201cis a central committee member of The Party for Socialism and Liberation\u201d and that \u201cin 2018, she co-founded The People\u2019s Forum.\u201d De La Cruz is listed as a director at the forum intax records. ThetaxformsforBreakThrough Mediashow that many of the group\u2019s top leaders are all tied to PSL as well. The NCRI also detailed more deep links between PSL and Singham\u2019s Marxist efforts in itsreportlast year, noting that \u201cBT Media was founded in 2020 by Ben Becker, a founding member of PSL\u201d and that \u201cthe key offices and editorial team of BT News are likewise dominated by PSL members.\u201d This includes De La Cruz serving as \u201cBT Media\u2019s Secretary and Director, as well as PSL\u2019s candidate for the 2024 Presidential election\u201d; Karla Reyes serving as \u201cBT Media\u2019s Chair and Director and De la Cruz\u2019s 2024 PSL Presidential campaign running mate\u201d; Yari Osorio serving as \u201cBT Media\u2019s Treasurer and Director and PSL\u2019s 2012 Vice-Presidential candidate\u201d; and Eugene Puryear serving as \u201cBT Media\u2019s Host and Producer\u201d and also running as \u201ca PSL Vice-Presidential candidate in 2008 and 2016.\u201d The group assessed that \u201cthe degree of overlap between BT Media and PSL on their executive and editorial teams is so significant that one can easily conclude that the former is functionally serving as a mouthpiece for the latter.\u201d The far-leftBreakThrough Newshas shared anti-ICE content in recent days that is similar to \u2014 and sometimes identical to \u2014 that shared by PSL, and BreakThrough has promoted PSL\u2019s work directlymultiple times. Network ContagionreportedPSL founding member Ben Becker as having foundedBreakThroughin 2020. The Network Contagionreleaseda 2024 report which found that BT Media is \u201cknown for promoting pro-CCP geopolitical interests through its outletBreakThrough News, shares numerous fiscal and organizational connections with other core organizations of the Singham Network.\u201d The People\u2019s Forum also \u201cprovided grants to BT Media in 2021 and 2022, in addition to significant financial support that BT Media received from other Singham-linked entities,\u201d the report found, and \u201cthese grants account for a substantial portion of BT Media\u2019s revenue, which nearly doubled year-over-year from $253,000 in 2020 to a total of $951,000 in 2022.\u201d The Heritage Foundation alsoassessedlast year thatBreakThrough News\u201cexemplifies the internal coordination among all the tentacles of the Singham network and of the ecosystem in general.\u201d A \u201ctorrent of dark money\u201d BreakThroughNewsis also part of the International People\u2019s Media Network, whichdescribes itselfas \u201ca network of independent media projects from across the globe that collaborate, working collectively to uplift people\u2019s voices and stories.\u201d A report by theDaily Beastrevealedthat \u201call of the International People\u2019s Media Network\u2019s affiliates \u2026 appear to drink from the same torrent of dark money pouring out of the bank accounts and nonprofits of tech mogul Neville \u2018Roy\u2019 Singham.\u201d The outlet said that \u201cfilings submitted to the Internal Revenue Service and the New York State Charities Bureau show BreakThrough News is a nonprofit that has drawn the bulk of its funding from the Justice and Education Fund.\u201d The outletsaidPSL \u201cappears as an allied group to the International People\u2019s Media Network on its webpage.\u201d The People\u2019s Forum andBreakThrough Newsalsolistthemselvesas sharing the same address in New York City.New Lines MagazinedescribesBreakThrough News as being \u201choused within The People\u2019s Forum New York office.\u201d TheFree Beaconpreviously alsoreportedthat key leaders for the People\u2019s Forum \u201cserve in top positions at Singham\u2019s Justice and Education Fund.\u201d The forum\u2019sexecutive director, Manolo De Los Santos, is also listed as the director and secretary at the fund, according totax records.

PSL and the Communist Revolution in America The \u201cProgram of the Party for Socialism and Liberation\u201d \u2014 essentially PSL\u2019s political platform \u2014declaresthat the group\u2019s members are \u201cMarxists in the United States.\u201d The platform is heavy on calls for Communist revolution. \u201cCapitalism cannot be voted out of power \u2014 it will take a revolution,\u201d PSL says, adding, \u201cThe Party for Socialism and Liberation is dedicated to building a revolutionary workers\u2019 party in the United States [\u2026] For the working class, revolution is a necessity and a right. The most brutal aspects of capitalism will not go away unless there is a socialist revolution. Only a revolution can do away with the rule of the capitalists once and for all.\u201d The far-left group\u2019s 2024presidential platformopposed essentially all U.S. foreign policy efforts to confront U.S. adversaries. \u201cThe new Cold War against China and Russia must end, along with associated aggression like the proxy war in Ukraine, massive military shipments to Taiwan, or any and all military build up against any targeted nation,\u201d PSL said. \u201cThe vast network of military bases the Pentagon maintains in other countries should be immediately closed. We demand the abolition of the NATO military alliance and AFRICOM. Cruel economic sanctions imposed on countries around the world \u2013 including Cuba, Venezuela, Zimbabwe, Eritrea, North Korea and Iran \u2013 must be lifted. All U.S. aid to apartheid Israel must immediately end.\u201d PSL\u2019s \u201cLiberation School\u201d The Communist group also hosts an online\u201cLiberation School\u201dwhich it says is an \u201ceducational site for activists and fighters.\u201d \u201cIn addition to in-depth articles, analysis, and Party documents, Liberation School features a growing number of online courses as well as study and discussion guides to help a new generation of revolutionaries learn, study, and apply Marxist theory,\u201d PSL says. There are dozens of lessons under the category of\u201cFundamentals of Marxism\u201dand dozens of lessons under the category of\u201cMarxist Theory\u201das well as more than a dozen lessons under the category of\u201cThe Soviet Union.\u201d PSL says that in one lesson \u2014\u201cLenin and the Path to Revolution\u201d\u2014 PSL\u2019s Becker \u201cteaches the life and legacy of Lenin, the formation of Leninism, and the revolutionary paths it generated across the world.\u201d Becker also put together a lesson for PSL and the People\u2019s Forum on\u201cThe History of theCommunist Manifesto.\u201d \u201cTravel with The People\u2019s Forum through a time machine to when theCommunist Manifestowas written!\u201d the website says. \u201cYou will learn about the political and economic forces that made writing theManifestonot only possible, but necessary. This text created international and timeless ripples, inspiring the masses to organize themselves to fight for a worker-led society across the world.\u201d PSL embraces Communist dictatorships The far-left group has also celebrated a number of Communist dictators. PSL has praised the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s takeover of China. \u201cVictory would have been unimaginable without the existence of the Chinese Communist Party and the extraordinary military it created, the People\u2019s Liberation Army,\u201d PSL\u2019swebsitesays. \u201cThe CCP-led government charted a course to build a new, socialist society.\u201d Becker, the co-founder of PSL, also wrote a piece for the communist group\u2019s website attempting to whitewash the Tiananmen Square Massacre of 1989. \u201cThe hysteria generated about the Tiananmen Square \u2018massacre\u2019 was based on a fictitious narrative about what actually happened when the Chinese government finally cleared the square of protestors on June 4, 1989,\u201d Beckerclaims. \u201cThe demonization of China was highly effective. Nearly all sectors of U.S. society, including most of the \u2018left,\u2019 accepted the imperialist presentation of what happened.\u201d PSL has also repeatedly declared its love for Communist-led Cuba,writingin January, \u201cWe stand with the Cuban Revolution! \u2026 Today, on the 66th anniversary of the victory of the great Cuban Revolution, we in the Party for Socialism and Liberation send our warm greetings and solidarity to the Cuban people.\u201d PSL\u2019s Marxist \u201cLiberation\u201d merch store Despite being avowedly Marxist, PSL still features a\u201cLiberation\u201d merchonline store. Some of the merchandise is fairly standard leftwing fare: a\u201cCancel the Rent\u201dposter, a\u201cBuild Schools Not Prisons\u201dhat, and\u201cFreedom for Palestine\u201dgear.But much of it displays the group\u2019s Communist and revolutionary aims.

Andthereis a \u201chand-designed poster uplifting Vietnamese anti-colonial revolutionary leader and fighter Nguyen Thi Binh.\u201d The National Museum of American Historysaidthat she was a \u201cVietnamese communist leader and politician who negotiated at the Paris Peace Conference on behalf of the Viet Cong.\u201d PSL\u2019s pro-Hamas stance PSL is openly hostile to Israel and defended the Hamas terrorist attacks which murdered hundreds of innocent civilians on October 7, 2023. \u201cThe unrelenting oppression, murder, torture and occupation carried out by the Israeli apartheid regime has precipitated a counter-offensive by Palestinian resistance forces. \u2026 The \u2026 false \u2018terrorism\u2019 label is being applied to the Palestinian people,\u201d the Communist groupsaidthe day of the deadly jihadist attack. The PSL also says: \u201cResistance to apartheid and fascist-type oppression is not a crime! It is the inevitable outcome for all people who demand self-determination rather than living with the boot-heel of the oppressors on their necks.\u201d PSLsaidon the one-year anniversary of the Hamas attacks that \u201cone year ago, a mass movement in solidarity with Palestine emerged in the United States that transformed the political landscape of this country\u2026 The Party for Socialism and Liberation joins with so many other people around the world in this commitment: we will keep up the struggle until the occupation falls and Palestine is free from the river to the sea!\u201d Backing away from Elias Rodriguez Elias Rodriguez, the confessed murderer of two Israeli Embassy staff members in the nation\u2019s capital in May, had a previous association with one of PSL\u2019s local chapters. \u201cThis brutal, anti-Semitic violence has no place in our country or anywhere in civilization,\u201d Attorney General Pamela Bondisaidlast month when announcing murder charges. \u201cWe will follow the facts and secure the most severe possible punishment for the perpetrator of this heinous crime, which robbed two wonderful young people of a bright future together.\u201d Rodriguez shot and killed Yaron Lischinsky, an Israeli national, and Sarah Lynn Milgrim, an American citizen, on the street outside an event for the American Jewish Committee.He reportedly shouted\u201dI did this for Gaza. Free Palestine. There\u2019s only one solution, intifada revolution\u201d after the shooting. In a 2017 article on PSL\u2019s Liberation News website, Rodriguez wasreportedlyphotographed at a protest holding signs distributed by ANSWER Coalition Chicago, and Rodriguez was quoted and described as being a member of PSL. The article has since been deleted, and PSL has denied any association with the murderer. \u201cWe reject any attempt to associate the PSL with the DC shooting,\u201d PSLtweetedon May 22. \u201cElias Rodriguez is not a member of the PSL. He had a brief association with one branch of the PSL that ended in 2017. We know of no contact with him in over 7 years. We have nothing to do with this shooting and do not support it.\u201d Neville \u201cComrade\u201d Singham PSL\u2019s links to Singham\u2019s funding network are not surprising \u2014 the tech billionaire is a true Marxist. \u201cFor months we\u2019ve been the target of a campaign that alleges our funding comes from \u2018dark money.\u2019 A few years ago we met Roy Singham, a Marxist comrade who sold his company & donated most of his wealth to non-profits that focus on political education, culture, & internationalism,\u201d the People\u2019s Forumtweetedin December 2021. SinghammarriedJodie Evans, the co-founder of the radical left-wing group Code Pink, in 2017. Her group touts itself as antiwar and has become increasingly pro-China in recent years. The New York Timesreportedthat Singham works in Shanghai, that his efforts there are linked to the CCP, and that he has attended at least one CCP workshop on promoting the party globally. The outlet also said Singham shares offices with a Chinese media company called Maku Group.
