The recently concluded first race weekend of the TGR Philippine Cup, the mobility company\u2019s premier racing series, shows that motorsports is alive more than ever in the country. What started with the locally made Vios OMR or one-make-race car has grown into a vibrant motorsports platform that brings together competition, community and accessibility among Filipino motoring fans. This year\u2019s first TGR Philippine Cup race weekend, held at the Clark International Speedway last March 22, roared to life with thrilling battles on the track and an even bigger goal off it: to make motorsports something everyone can be part of\u2014whether you're a seasoned driver, a rookie or simply a fan of speed. \u201cIt is my wish that more people can share the motorsport experience and the inspiration to always be pushing their limits for the better. We are all part of this mission by continuously innovating and providing opportunities for both aspiring and seasoned racers to showcase their skills,\u201d shared Toyota Motor Philippines President Masando Hashimoto. \u201cOur recent feats prove that our dedication to test and develop more capable and better cars is real. At TGR Philippines, we stay committed to growing an inclusive and exciting motorsports community where we can all come together and celebrate our love for cars and motorsports,\u201d he added. **A starting line for everyone** Every racing journey has to start somewhere. For most racers in the TGR Philippine Cup, that \u201csomewhere\u201d is the TOYOTA GAZOO Racing Academy Philippines (TGRA)\u2014a program built for aspiring racers who want to experience the thrill of the track for the very first time. Held at the Clark International Speedway, this year\u2019s TGRA guided new racers through classroom and on-track sessions, turning nervous energy into confidence behind the wheel. Professional coaches taught students the ropes of racing and showed them how to apply them on the racetrack. But this season isn\u2019t just about fresh starts\u2014it\u2019s also about comebacks. The newly introduced Legacy Class in the TGR Philippine Cup brought former Vios Cup racers back into the fold, adding a new layer of excitement as seasoned drivers returned to relive the thrill of competition and get another shot at glory. \u201cPreviously named the Vios Cup, the now TOYOTA GAZOO Racing Philippine Cup has been running for 11 years now, and we always target to make it even more thrilling, more exciting for racers, thrill-seekers and motorsports fans,\u201d shared TMP AVP for Marketing Services Andy Ty. Beyond the track, Toyota ensured there was something for every kind of motorsport enthusiast. Spectators experienced heart-racing side activities, including drifting demonstrations and high-speed hot laps featuring the new GR Yaris and GR Supra. Fans also got to see up-close Toyota\u2019s GR lineup and Lexus\u2019 F SPORT lineup and enjoy sim and remote control racing. \u201cWith our motorsports program, we believe that seeing is believing\u2014and experiencing it is another level entirely,\u201d Ty said, adding, \u201cWe hope you can join us at our events to truly see and feel what it\u2019s like to be on track and push your limits for better.\u201d **Representation and the rise of new faces** Once seen as a niche or elite pursuit, motorsports is becoming more diverse and inclusive\u2014thanks in large part to Toyota\u2019s efforts. From celebrities and influencers to executives like TMP President Hashimoto himself, the TGR Philippine Cup is proof that the thrill of racing knows no bounds. This year\u2019s grid also made room for a growing number of women racers like Arianne Bautista, Maila Alivia and Julia de los Angeles who raced shoulder to shoulder with veterans and newcomers alike, making a powerful statement that motorsports is for everyone. \u201cRight now, in this season, we\u2019re just three girls, and we\u2019re really competing for our lives here. It\u2019s a sign that anybody can do this sport, as long as you have the will and the skills, you can. This is genderless,\u201d Bautista toldPhilstar.com. Also back on the grid, content creator and motoring enthusiast Reph Bangsil couldn\u2019t hide his excitement about racing again in the TGR Philippine Cup. \u201cI love everything about racing in the TGR Philippine Cup. I love the thrill, the adrenaline\u2014every time I go out there, my heart beats so fast. It\u2019s like you\u2019re in a different dimension whenever you\u2019re around the track. It really is the thrill of a lifetime,\u201d he said in an interview. **Bringing the GR spirit to the Philippines** Toyota's journey in motorsports has been one of bold moves and continuous innovation, both globally and in the Philippines. It all began in 2007 when then-Vice President Akio Toyoda drove a second-hand Altezza through the grueling N\u00fcrburgring 24 Hours with a small team of mechanics. This race sparked the creation of Team GAZOO and marked the beginning of Toyota\u2019s vision for performance: \"Roads build people, and people build cars.\" By 2009, Team GAZOO was already competing in global championships, solidifying its presence on the international motorsports stage. Fast forward to 2017, GAZOO Racing Company was established, expanding its reach to include the design and retailing of performance parts as well as reproducing components for Toyota\u2019s iconic sports cars from the 1970s to 1980s. As we know it, the Vios Cup has evolved into the TGR Philippine Cup, aligning the Philippines\u2019 premier racing series with Toyota's global GAZOO Racing brand and signaling a deeper commitment to motorsports excellence in the country. Reaching a new milestone this 2025 season, it introduced the all-new Club Race, providing a platform to GR performance cars such as the GR Supra, GR 86, and GR Yaris. Drivers can compete in their respective models, further taking the Philippine motorsports scene to new heights. In its 11 seasons, the TGR Philippine Cup has also cultivated racing talent and grown their love for the sport, both in sim racing and real-world competition. Drivers like Luis Moreno, who transitioned from virtual racing to the Novice Class after securing the championship at the 2024 TOYOTA GAZOO Racing GT Cup Philippines, and second place at the 2023 TOYOTA GAZOO Racing GT Cup Asia Finals, are proof of the program's success. Similarly, 2024 Novice Class champion Russel Reyes has advanced to the Sporting Class, showcasing the progression from sim racing to the racetrack. **The road ahead** By fostering inclusivity and ensuring the sport\u2019s continuous evolution, TOYOTA GAZOO Racing Philippines is solidifying its pivotal role in shaping the future of motorsports in the country. With the first race weekend setting a high standard for the season, anticipation continues to build for the next two race weekends. Happening on May 24 and 25 in the South of Manila, Villar City, the second race weekend is promising even more intense rivalries, high-speed action and unforgettable moments\u2014on the streets. Stay tuned as TOYOTA GAZOO Racing Philippines continues to push the limits of speed, skill and sportsmanship.
