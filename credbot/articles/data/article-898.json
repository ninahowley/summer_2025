Over the course of my sports writing career I covered Walter Payton, Jerry Rice and Brett Favre essentially from high school through the Super Bowl. You\u2019re talking about the leading receiver and scorer, the second leading passer and the second leading rusher in NFL history, all from rural Mississippi. What other state can come close to that? It\u2019s a story we need to tell, tell well and keep telling.\u201d Cleveland has received numerous state, regional and national awards for telling those stories. In 2011, he became the first sportswriter to receive the Richard Wright Award for Literary Excellence.
