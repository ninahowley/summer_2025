The left-wing gender insanity being pushed on our children is an act of child abuse,\u201d Donald Trump declared in a 2024 campaign video. \u201cOn Day One,\u201d Trump vowed, he would sign an \u201cexecutive order instructing every federal agency to cease all programs that promote the concept of sex and gender transition at any age.\u201d He would also ask Congress to ban child sex-change procedures, prohibit the use of taxpayer dollars \u201cto promote or pay for these procedures\u201d in adults, \u201csupport the creation of a private right of action for victims to sue doctors who have unforgivably performed these procedures on minor children.\u201d He pledged to unleash the Department of Justice to \u201cinvestigate Big Pharma and the big hospital networks to determine whether they have deliberately covered up horrific long-term side effects of sex transitions in order to get rich at the expense of vulnerable patients.\u201d Demonstrating how even gender ideology\u2019s critics have been conditioned to use its language, Trump said that he would ask Congress to pass a bill declaring that there are only \u201ctwo genders,\u201d which are \u201cassigned at birth.\u201d Presumably, he meant twosexes, which aredeterminedat conception andrecognizedat or before birth.

Assuming that these are not empty promises, Trump\u2019s victory in November poses a serious threat to the gender medicine industry. That industry, however, was already on the defensive on the eve of the presidential election. Since 2021,24 stateshave passed laws banning the use of puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones, and surgeries for youth who feel discomfort with their sex. An additional two\u2014Arizona and New Hampshire\u2014have prohibited the use of surgeries, but not hormones. A challenge to one of these laws, from Tennessee, is on the Supreme Court\u2019s 2025 docket. The case,U.S.v.Skrmetti, will determine how states can regulate gender medicine\u2014and, with its 6\u20133 conservative majority, the Court likely will rule in Tennessee\u2019s favor. Nearly two dozen de-transitioners\u2014young men and (more often) women who were given drugs and surgeries, only to realize later that what they really needed was counseling and time to mature\u2014are now suing their doctors and clinics for medical mistreatment. Though these lawsuits are tough to win, even a single multimillion-dollar verdict or out-of-court settlement could send malpractice insurance premiums soaring and create a chilling effect in states where \u201cgender-affirming care\u201d remains legal. The gender medicine industry\u2019s most powerful argument\u2014that kids will commit suicide without access to \u201cgender-affirming care\u201d\u2014suffered another serious blow in February, when aFinnish studyfound that gender-dysphoric minors and young adults\u2019 suicide risk, while higher than the general population\u2019s, was still thankfully low. Crucially, the study was the first of its kind to control for psychiatric comorbidities. The researchers found that gender-dysphoric young people were not statistically significantly more likely to commit suicide relative to non-dysphoric individualswith similar levels of psychiatric problems. In other words, comorbid mental-health challenges, extremely common in gender-dysphoric youth, explain that population\u2019s elevated suicide risk\u2014not gender issues per se. At the oral arguments inU.S.v.Skrmetti, Chase Strangio, the ACLU\u2019s star transgender litigator, admitted that suicide among trans-identified youths is \u201cthankfully and admittedly rare.\u201dAdmittedly? Between April and August of 2024, three events sent shockwaves through the world of gender medicine. In April, pediatrician Hilary Cass submitted a scathing 388-page report on the U.K.\u2019s Gender Identity Development Service (GIDS) to the National Health Service of England. Dubbed the \u201cCass Review,\u201d the report\u2019s findings and conclusions were based on a multiyear investigation of GIDS and interviews with more than 1,000 people and groups and included seven new systematic reviews of evidence on various topics related to youth gender transition. The review\u2019s conclusions were unambiguous: the evidence for the safety and efficacy of medical transition is \u201cremarkably weak\u201d and cannot support the continued routine use of puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones. The \u201cgender-affirming\u201d model of care, centered on an adolescent\u2019s self-declared identity, is at odds with the standard tools of clinical assessment, to say nothing of accumulated knowledge about adolescent development. Since the Cass Review\u2019s publication, the U.K. has banned puberty blockers as a routine intervention for adolescent gender dysphoria\u2014a move endorsed by Tory and Labour governments alike. Further use of the drugs for treatment of gender dysphoria in minors is subject to strict research protocols. The powerful British Medical Association at first opposed the Cass Review\u2019s recommendations but later retreated from that position. If the Netherlands is the midwife that brought pediatric transition into this world, England is the undertaker that may help bring it to its final rest. The review has been unevenly received in the United States. On the one hand, its release gave liberal newspapers an unprecedented opportunity to admit that Republicans were not alone in their concerns about \u201cgender-affirming care.\u201d Cass joined WBUR\u2019s Meghna Chakrabarti for a sympathetic and thoughtful interview on her show,On Point. TheNew York Times\u2019s initial coverage, while passable, buried some of the report\u2019s critical insights and implications under distracting asides about its political context. In a follow-up Q&A with Cass, however, theTimesgave the former president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health space to reflect on the growing divergence between the U.S. and Europe. Cass said that while she has \u201cenormous respect\u201d for the American Academy of Pediatrics, she noted that the group is \u201cholding on to a position that is now demonstrated to be out of date by multiple systematic reviews.\u201d TheTimeseventually ran an opinion piece by Pamela Paul, \u201cWhy Is the U.S. Still Pretending We Know Gender-Affirming Care Works?\u201d Even theWashington Posthas started to come around. On December 15, the editorial board published an article criticizing the gender industry for its failure to study these interventions properly and maintaining that red-state laws are a response to that failure. \u201cThe failure to adequately assess these treatments,\u201d the authors wrote, \u201cgives Tennessee reason to worry about them\u2014and legal room to restrict them.\u201d A sentence like this would have been unthinkable even six months ago. But the Cass Review\u2019s reception among other liberal media outlets and most medical associations was disappointing. STAT News and CNN\u2019s news desks largely ignored the report\u2019s release, despite its being the most significant development in the field of youth gender medicine since the Dutch began the experiment with puberty blockers in the 1990s. The Endocrine Society, meantime, told theNew York Timesthat the review \u201cdoes not contain any new research\u201d that would lead it to update its guidelines\u2014a clever evasion, since the Cass Review\u2019s seven systematic reviews of evidence and guideline quality, though tops in the field of evidence-based medicine, are not primary \u201cresearch.\u201d The World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH) criticized the review partly because Cass and her team are not gender clinicians\u2014in other words, because they were not personally invested in the treatments whose evidence they were evaluating and were thus free of conflicts of interest. \u201cThe U.K. has banned puberty blockers for adolescent gender dysphoria\u2014a move endorsed by Tory and Labour governments alike.\u201d Recognizing that ignoring the Cass Review wouldn\u2019t make it go away, some U.S. medical groups banned its very discussion on their professional e-mail chains. When Shlomit Gorin, a Bay Area psychologist, posted information about the report and its evidence reviews on the Listserv of a formal division of the American Psychological Association, the moderator blocked her post on the grounds that it violated the group\u2019s 2020 \u201cLetter of Apology to LGBTQ+ Communities,\u201d which forbids \u201cspeech that is injurious to LGBTQ+ members.\u201d A similar episode unfolded in the APA\u2019s Pennsylvania chapter, where moderators shut down posts about the Cass Review because \u201cLGBTQIA+\u201d members might feel \u201ctargeted, harmed, and hurt by this literature being repeatedly shared.\u201d \u201cWe need to regulate our own behavior,\u201d the group told its members. These examples illustrate how professional medical associations often serve more aptly as associations for medical professionals. Professionals who put their patients first would consider it essential to hear robust debate about scientific developments as significant as the Cass Review. Unfortunately, at the APA and elsewhere, the feelings of dues-paying adult members trump the interests of patients. The second landmark event that roiled gender medicine was the disclosure of internal WPATH communications as part ofBoev.Marshall, a lawsuit challenging Alabama\u2019s ban on \u201cgender-affirming care\u201d for minors. When historians look back and ask what led to the downfall of this medical pseudo-experiment on children, the activists\u2019 decision to sue Alabama will be seen as their most significant blunder. TheBoeplaintiffs argue that Alabama\u2019s Vulnerable Child Compassion and Protection Act unconstitutionally deprives \u201ctransgender adolescents\u201d of \u201cmedically necessary\u201d care. Because their chief piece of evidence for this proposition is WPATH\u2019s Standards of Care for the Health of Transgender and Gender Diverse People, Version 8 (SOC-8), the court granted Alabama\u2019s request to subpoena all internal WPATH communications related to SOC-8\u2019s development. Here is a taste of what those documents revealed: In 2019, WPATH commissioned numerous systematic reviews of evidence from experts at Johns Hopkins University. However, after consulting \u201csocial justice lawyers\u201d who advised that conducting evidence reviews would \u201creveal little or no evidence and put us in an untenable position in terms of affecting policy or winning lawsuits,\u201d and after seeing indications that the evidence was indeed lacking, WPATH suppressed the publication of these reviews. It further demanded that the JHU team henceforth submit any manuscript for WPATH\u2019s approval prior to submission in a medical journal and that authors of these submissions declare in their manuscript that their work was free of any external influence. In the final version of SOC-8, WPATH wrote that conducting a systematic review of evidence for adolescent medical transition \u201cis not possible.\u201d The chair and lead author of SOC-8 admitted in a deposition that \u201cmost\u201d of the standards\u2019 chapter authors were chosen because they had previously favored the \u201cgender-affirming\u201d medical pathway over psychotherapeutic alternatives\u2014a clear violation of the widely accepted principle that guideline development should be free from financial or intellectual conflicts of interest. WPATH\u2019s former president, surgeon Marci Bowers, said that when considering potential members for the SOC-8 development team, it was \u201cimportant\u201d that a candidate be \u201can advocate for [gender transition] treatments.\u201d Bowers was aware of the organization\u2019s misrepresentations of medical science. In a private e-mail to colleagues, Bowers wrote that SOC-8 \u201cis a balancing act between what I feel to be true and what we need to say.\u201d Bowers also admitted in the deposition to making over $1 million performing gender surgeries in 2023. WPATH caved to pressure from the American Academy of Pediatrics and then\u2013Health and Human Services assistant secretary Rachel Levine to strike from SOC-8 any mention of age minimums for hormones and surgeries. The organization had already shirked a bedrock principle of guideline development\u2014reliance on systematic evidence reviews\u2014and instead used a consensus-based process with (conflicted) authors. Several days after SOC-8\u2019s publication, WPATH issued the correction, eliminating age minimums, without going through its consensus-building process. The organization did not, however, amend its statement in SOC-8 that its recommendations are the product of consensus\u2014a serious violation of transparency. Privately, one WPATH leader complained that the organization was \u201callowing US politics to dictate international professional clinical guidelines.\u201d SOC-8 included a chapter on \u201ceunuchs,\u201d which WPATH defines as a \u201cgender identity\u201d found in people (including children) \u201cassigned male at birth\u201d who desire castration. WPATH recommends that such individuals undergo castration if they so desire. The standards refer to an online forum called \u201cEunuch Archive,\u201d which they say contains \u201cthe greatest wealth of information about contemporary eunuch-identified people.\u201d According to Alabama\u2019s summary of the website, men can go there to find fetishistic stories of, among other things, \u201cpedophilic fantasies of children who have been castrated to halt their puberty.\u201d Within days of the unsealing of theBoedocuments, the Biden White House told theNew York Timesthat it no longer supported gender surgeries for minors. A week later, the White House told 19th News, a progressive outlet, that it \u201ccontinue[s] to support gender-affirming care for minorslike mental health care\u201d (my emphasis). The apparent emphasis on psychotherapy rather than on hormones outraged transgender activist groups. \u201cThe Biden administration is flat wrong on this,\u201dwrote the Human Rights Campaign, the largest transgender lobby group.Leaked e-mailsshowed that HRC immediately kicked into action, organizing its network of LGBT groups and activists to pressure the administration. Five hours after 19th News published the press release, the White House issued a new statement that replaced \u201cmental health care\u201d with \u201ccontinuum of care.\u201d On November 5, Democrats saw the fruits of their repeated concessions to transgender activists. A third major blow landed in August, when the American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS) broke from the supposed consensus of U.S. medical groups in support of \u201cgender-affirming care\u201d for minors. It did so in a press release sent to me, in response to questions that I had sent about the Cass Review, the WPATH discovery from Alabama, and ongoing lawsuits by former patients against ASPS-affiliated gender surgeons. The ASPS responded that it had \u201cnot endorsed any organization\u2019s practice recommendations for the treatment of adolescents with gender dysphoria,\u201d that there is \u201cconsiderable uncertainty as to the long-term efficacy for the use of chest and genital surgical interventions,\u201d and that \u201cthe existing evidence base is viewed as low quality/low certainty.\u201d ASPS is the largest medical association representing plastic surgeons in the U.S. and Canada, boasting more than 11,000 members. One would think that of all subspecialties, plastic surgery would be the last publicly to question the evidence for pediatric \u201ctransition.\u201d But due partly to the bold leadership of its president, Steven Williams, it was the first. In a podcast with a gender surgeon and ASPS member who criticized the organization\u2019s move, Williams, the ASPS\u2019s first black president, cited the Tuskegee experiments as evidence that doctors should not blindly be trusted to self-correct. I broke the news about ASPS in an article in which I also presented findings from an ongoing insurance database analysis about the incidence of mastectomy as a treatment for gender dysphoria in teen girls. At least 5,000 teen girls in the U.S. had their breasts amputated for \u201cgender transition\u201d purposes between 2017 and 2023. This includes at least 50 girls aged 12\u00bd or younger at the time of surgery. Because our database did not include closed-billing health systems like Kaiser Permanente, the largest provider in California, or procedures paid for out of pocket, the true number of girls who have received \u201ctop surgery\u201d is almost certainly higher. U.S.v.Skrmettiis the Supreme Court\u2019s highest-profile case of this term. The mere existence of the lawsuit is a political liability for the Democratic Party, which the American public now correctly recognizes as unable or unwilling to stand up to transgender pressure groups. According toa recent YouGov poll, 54 percent of American voters believe that minors should not have access to puberty blockers, compared with only 19 percent who say that they should. Though support for laws that ban these drugs is less strong (45 percent), even fewer Americans oppose such laws (32 percent). In 2019, Kamala Harris infamously expressed support for taxpayer-funded sex-change surgeries for detained illegal immigrants. Her answer exemplifies the chokehold that transgender pressure groups\u2014whose leaders are accountable to foundations and deep-pocket donors, not to the electorate, and who thus have no incentive to moderate their positions\u2014have on the Democratic Party. Smelling blood in the water, the Trump campaign spentabout $20 millionon attack ads focused on transgenderism, with Republicans spendingover $65 millionnationally. One of the ads, which memorably claimed, \u201cKamala is for they/them. President Trump is for you,\u201d may have been decisive in November. According to theNew York Times, Harris\u2019s most important super PAC found that a version of the \u201cthey/them\u201d ad \u201cshifted the race 2.7 percentage points in . . . Trump\u2019s favor after viewers watched it.\u201d Following their party\u2019s sweeping losses, two congressional Democrats\u2014Tom Suozzi of New York and Seth Moulton of Massachusetts\u2014expressed frustration over how Democrats have handled the trans issue. \u201cDemocrats spend way too much time trying not to offend anyone rather than being brutally honest about the challenges many Americans face,\u201d Moulton told theNew York Times. \u201cI have two little girls, I don\u2019t want them getting run over on a playing field by a male or formerly male athlete, but as a Democrat I\u2019m supposed to be afraid to say that.\u201d Donald Trump returns to office with a clear mandate to use executive power and leadership in Congress to undo some of the most radical and damaging policies and social practices of the past decade. This will require putting common sense and science forward. It will also require building consensus with liberals and moderates who are aligned on this issue to ensure a lasting policy coalition. It\u2019s important to recognize that transgender activism in medicine and education flourished during Trump\u2019s first term in office. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality in the Department of Health and Human Services had no trouble supporting \u201cgender-affirming care\u201d during these years. Transgender-focused NGOs ran extremely lucrative fund-raising campaigns, filling their coffers and staffing their ranks with ambitious young lawyers eager for a fight. Medical associations issued guidelines recommending hormones and surgeries. Democratic states passed laws prohibiting \u201cconversion therapy,\u201d which they defined as any approach that is not \u201cgender-affirming.\u201d The number of kids seeking body modification as a solution to their woes skyrocketed. None of this happened with Trump\u2019s blessing, of course, but it illustrates the challenge of reining in a large and sprawling bureaucracy staffed only partially with political appointments. A second Trump administration will thus need to get serious about tackling the roots of the crisis. This will mean appointing individuals with experience combating transgender activism and finding ways to remove or curb the influence of unappointed bureaucrats. The American public is hungry for a return to sanity. With Democrats facing a civil war over trans issues and the gender medicine industry\u2019s back to the wall, now is the time for smart and principled leadership.
