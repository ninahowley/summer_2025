The committee \u201cgratefully received his repentance and apology\u201d and recognized \u201cthe seriousness of the situation.\u201d It also expressed regret for the fallout and thanked Chapell for decades of service. The committee unanimously appointed John Bise as Chapell\u2019s temporary replacement, pending the Theological Examination Committee\u2019s review of his qualifications. The committee said it did not have time to nominate a full replacement for Chapell in time for the denomination\u2019s General Assembly meeting, which is scheduled to begin June 23 in Chattanooga, Tenn., but plans to nominate someone before the 2026 meeting. On theGospelboundpodcast last month, Chapellheld up a Post-it notelisting names of individuals he said were \u201cscandalizers\u201d who had all left their families, left the faith, or taken their own lives. Viewers then took screenshots of the list and shared the image across social media, prompting rebuttals that multiple people on the list are still living with their families and involved in the church. Pastor Andy Webb\u2019s name was on the list. While he is no longer with the PCA, he serves in North Carolina with the Associate Reformed Presbyterian Church. Webbsaidin a public statement that Chapell called him after the interview to apologize and that he forgave him. Carl Trueman, who writes for WORLD Opinions and whose name was also on the list, likewise received an apology from Chapell. Doug Hart was close friends with an individual on the list, David Winecoff, who died in a mountain climbing accident in 1993. Hart filed a formal request for an investigation into Chapell, saying that he violated the Ninth Commandment\u2019s prohibition on testifying falsely about one\u2019s neighbor. He told WORLD on Friday that he thought both Chapell and the Administrative Committee made the right decision. Before the Administrative Committee released its statement on Friday, a few pastors expressed support for Chapell. PCA teaching elder David F. Coffin Jr. said earlier this week that Chapell did not lie and that the individuals who took screenshots of the list and spread them around the internet committed greater wrong than Chapell. \u201cThe fact is, on the evidence, I do not believe you lied,\u201d Coffin wrote intheAquila Report, an independent religious publication, earlier this week, relaying remarks he\u2019d sent to Chapell. \u201cYour departure, in these circumstances, will profoundly debilitate the office of the stated clerk, an office that you have adorned by your labors.\u201d Bise, who will serve temporarily as Chapell\u2019s replacement, has decades of experience in church courts at all levels of the PCA, the Administrative Committee said. He served as the moderator of the PCA\u2019s General Assembly in Birmingham, Ala., in 2022, and, according to the statement, he is currently a ruling elder at Cornerstone Presbyterian Church in Huntsville, Ala.
