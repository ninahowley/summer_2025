An analysis of recent decisions found that some judges rely on what juvenile justice advocates say is unfair reasoning to keep those young people in adult court. Facebook Twitter Email March 20, 2024 Each year, hundreds of Maryland teens find themselves face to face with a judge and two possible outcomes: a judgment in adult court and possible prison time, or a transfer to the juvenile court and the opportunity to get therapy. It\u2019s up to the judge to decide. An investigation by WYPR and APM Reports found that some judges are using what juvenile justice advocates say are arbitrary and inconsistent reasons to keep teenagers charged with serious crimes in adult court. A review of more than three dozen court hearings over the past three years found a process that subjects teenagers to adult jails, courts and sentences despite decades of research showing these tactics push teens to commit more crimes. When deciding whether to treat these children as adults, judges sometimes relied on questionable reasoning. The findings include: A Baltimore City judge said a teenager\u2019s large size was an argument to keep him in the adult system.

Advocates who reviewed the findings called the judges\u2019 statements \u201cappalling\u201d and \u201cunfair.\u201d \u201cThe first word that comes to mind is \u2018horrendous,\u2019\u201d said Natasha Dartigue, head of the Maryland Office of the Public Defender. \u201cA second word that comes to mind is \u2018heartbreaking.\u2019\u201d When asked about the rulings, a spokesman for the Maryland Judiciary said in an email that the judiciary cannot comment on individual cases but noted that judges face a difficult task and must evaluate \u201ca myriad of factors for each case\u2019s unique circumstances.\u201d Maryland law has long required teens charged with any one of more than 30 different crimes to be placed in adult court. As a result, the state automatically charges more youth as adults than almost any other state, according to data from The Sentencing Project. The vast majority are Black. These findings come in the wake of a 2021 Supreme Court of Maryland ruling that says teens charged as adults should be placed in the juvenile system if they're likely to benefit from its therapeutic programs. The analysis also comes as communities across the region grapple with fears of elevated juvenile crime, although data shows juvenile arrests are on the decline. Nearly half of the teens whose cases remain in adult court end up having their charges dropped or are otherwise not convicted. Youth also spend an average of 7 1/2 months waiting \u2014 sometimes in adult jail \u2014 for their cases to be resolved, according to an analysis of data from the Maryland judiciary and jail records. Advocates have been trying to repeal the state\u2019s automatic charging law for years. But those efforts have met fierce resistance from elected prosecutors who say reform will undermine public safety. While testifying in opposition to one such bill last year, Baltimore County State\u2019s Attorney Scott Shellenberger hearkened back to a notorious 1995 rape of a school nurse by a student. \u201cThese are not children. These are not children!\u201d he shouted, enunciating each word as he invoked some of the most egregious crimes caused by teens. Prosecutors and judges are tasked with keeping the public safe, and few would envy the decisions each must make. Many of the cases reviewed by WYPR and APM Reports detail teens behaving in troubling and dangerous ways. But only a small minority of teens affected by this law were charged with such horrific crimes as rape or murder. Each year, Maryland prosecutors automatically charge an average of roughly 700 cases involving juvenile defendants in the adult court system for a range of crimes including misdemeanor gun possession and first-degree assault. The juvenile system provides youth and their families with treatment designed to prevent future offenses. The adult system is more punitive. It offers fewer treatment options, and none specifically for minors. For at least two decades, studies have repeatedly shown that charging juveniles as adults increases rates of reoffending. Youth who spend time in adult jails or prisons are more likely to reoffend and to reoffend faster, were arrested more times on average, and had longer criminal careers than those who did not spend time in adult detention facilities, according to a 2022 study that followed roughly 13,000 16- and 17-year-olds arrested in New York in 1987 and charged as adults. Yet prosecutors say too many youth commit crimes after spending time in Maryland\u2019s juvenile system. They argue the adult system does a better job of keeping the public safe, in part because courts can keep tabs on defendants for lengthy probation and parole periods. And to keep young people in the adult system, some prosecutors made arguments that discounted scientific research. In southern Maryland, Charles County prosecutor John Stackhouse suggested in at least two cases that judges disregard well-established research showing adolescent brains continue developing until age 25. \u201cYou can find a study that says anything,\u201d he told the judge. Tony Covington, the state\u2019s attorney in Charles County and Stackhouse\u2019s boss, has \u201cno reason to doubt the research,\u201d but said the judge in each case should consider \u201cwhat is the extent of [the defendant\u2019s] lack of development?\u201d **Traumatized teen or \u2018robot\u2019 made for crime?** In Maryland, a child charged as an adult can ask a judge to transfer his or her case to the juvenile system, which offers extensive treatment services. A 2021 decision from the Supreme Court of Maryland,Davis vs. State, says during these transfer hearings, judges must prioritize the child\u2019s likelihood of benefitting from therapeutic programming in the juvenile system. Other factors, including public safety and the severity of the alleged crime, must \u201cconverge on amenability to treatment,\u201d according to the ruling. Since that decision, judges have transferred about two-thirds of cases to juvenile court. Last spring, a 16-year-old was facing carjacking charges in the courtroom of Prince George\u2019s County Judge Michael Whalen. According to police, the teenager walked up to a man in a parked car at a 7-Eleven convenience store, showed him a gun, then took his car. Kevin, who we\u2019re identifying by his middle name because he\u2019s a minor, had already experienced more traumatic events than many people face in their lives. He was sexually abused at age 6, according to expert testimony. Three friends died, one in his arms. Kevin was shot, too, and while he was recovering became addicted to opioids. His stepfather was murdered about a month after Kevin was shot. Kevin was charged with carjacking just three months after that. \u201cI felt like the world wasn\u2019t giving me no chances, so why give anybody else a chance?\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cI felt like it wasn\u2019t getting no better.\u201d In a report, a social worker told the court that Kevin\u2019s traumatic experiences \u201cwere likely significant contributing factors\u201d to his actions. Kevin had not had \u201cappropriate mental health care,\u201d she wrote, and his risk factors \u201care able to be best mitigated and treated through the services available within the Department of Juvenile Services.\u201d A psychologist recommended Kevin receive several mental health services, including individual cognitive behavioral therapy and intensive family counseling. Based in part on her report, the Department of Juvenile Services recommended placing Kevin in a residential program. Kevin\u2019s family and friends came to the transfer hearing. Some told Whalen about Kevin\u2019s supportive home environment and his kind, respectful nature. But Kevin\u2019s family support and good behavior worked against him. Whalen pointed out that Kevin was respectful and courteous to his family during the same time period he was committing crimes, \u201cso I think he can be as manipulative as anyone.\u201d Whalen also noted that Kevin continued to get passing grades at school despite \u201call this apparent emotional instability,\u201d and said he didn\u2019t believe Kevin\u2019s behavior changed significantly from the time he was shot until he was arrested. \u201cHaving the support that he did,\u201d Whalen ruled from the bench, \u201cI do not believe that he is amenable for treatment.\u201d On a Zoom call from a special prison in Baltimore for people under age 18, Kevin recalled hearing Whalen\u2019s decision. \u201cIt didn\u2019t add up to me,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was almost like he was just making it seem like I was a robot made specifically for crime.\u201d After Kevin lost his transfer hearing, he pleaded guilty to robbery. Had he initially been charged with robbery instead of carjacking, his case would have started in juvenile court and would havebeen resolved within 60 days, as required by law. Instead, Kevin spent 347 days in detention, including a few months in adult jail. Eventually, another judge sentenced Kevin to time already served, plus a year and a half in prison: much more than the three months to a year teens typically receive in juvenile facilities. Kevin, now 17, said he did commit a crime and deserved to be held accountable. But he said he wishes people would understand that he\u2019s still a child, and when he has nightmares, he still crawls into his mom\u2019s bed. Kevin\u2019s case was one of more than three dozen transfer hearings reviewed by WYPR and APM Reports. Throughout the hearings, judges struggled to find objective ways to measure amenability, and prosecutors made forceful, and at times, dubious claims in their efforts to keep cases in adult court. Whalen, the judge in Kevin\u2019s case, repeated a refrain at multiple hearings as he announced his decisions to keep youth in adult court. He said he acknowledged the requirement to consider a youth\u2019s amenability to treatment. \u201cHowever,\u201d he said, \u201cI believe that the appellate courts expect trial judges to execute some common sense when they make their decisions.\u201d **\u2018Completely, utterly absurd\u2019** There are so many children charged as adults in Maryland that some adult courts have their own juvenile divisions. Circuit Court Judge Emanuel Brown was the \u201cjudge-in-charge\u201d of one such division in Baltimore City between 2018 and his retirement last fall. In a 2021 case, Brown denied a transfer to the juvenile court in part because of the teen\u2019s size. The teen, he said, \u201cis listed physically as being 6 feet, 1 inches tall and 164.4 pounds. That factor weighs against transfer.\u201d Marsha Levick, chief legal officer and co-founder of the Juvenile Law Center, said raising a child\u2019s physical size in the context of whether they are amenable to treatment is \u201ccompletely, utterly absurd.\u201d \u201cBy any measure, it has zero to do with their capacity for rehabilitation,\u201d she said. State law requires judges consider \u201cthe mental and physical condition of the child\u201d when deciding whether to transfer a youth to the juvenile court. But Aisha Braveboy, the state\u2019s attorney in Prince George\u2019s County, said using size as a reason to deny transfer is \u201cunfair\u201d and \u201ccould lead to outcomes that are problematic.\u201d In another case, Brown declined to transfer a 17-year-old with no prior record, although he acknowledged the teen had asked for treatment and \u201chas some mental health challenges that would better be treated in the juvenile justice system.\u201d As a child, the boy had repeatedly broken his father\u2019s rules forbidding him from leaving the house except to attend school. Because of this, his father kicked him out at age 12, making him homeless. In his decision, Brown said the teen\u2019s decision not to return home was evidence he didn\u2019t respect authority and therefore would not be amenable to treatment. At other hearings in Baltimore City, prosecutors argued that teens who decided to get tattoos or have sex had made adult decisions and therefore should be tried as adults. Baltimore City State\u2019s Attorney Ivan Bates defended the practices of his staff. In a written statement, he claimed Baltimore prosecutors based their arguments on legal precedence. \u201cIt is unfair to take snippets of an argument that, taken out of context, does a disservice to the youth and the law,\u201d Bates wrote. **\u2018Arbitrary\u2019 decisions stem from an \u2018arbitrary\u2019 standard** Judges including Brown at times seemed to disagree on whether teens\u2019 mental health diagnoses should weigh for or against transfer to juvenile court. In one case, Brown chose to keep a 16-year-old charged with a misdemeanor gun offense in the adult system \u2014 which offers little mental health or substance-use treatment \u2014 in part because the teen struggled with mental illness. \u201cThe juvenile system regularly addresses these kinds of offenses,\u201d Brown said. \u201cHowever, public safety concerns increase exponentially when the juvenile possessing a loaded handgun has mental health challenges, and reportedly use marijuana.\u201d But in Montgomery County, Judge Kevin Hessler opted not to send a teen charged with misdemeanor gun possession to juvenile court because his mental illness wasn\u2019t severe enough. The defendant, evaluated as low risk, was on track to graduate high school and wanted to go to college. He was diagnosed with generalized anxiety and a trauma- and stressor-related disorder. Hessler acknowledged that the defendant seemed likely to participate in treatment but said the defendant\u2019s mental health conditions were not severe enough \u201cto militate significantly against trying him as an adult.\u201d He denied the transfer to juvenile court. Kids\u2019 school records were one of the most frequently cited reasons judges gave for denying transfer \u2014 second only to the severity of the alleged offense, according to the analysis of transfer hearings. Last June, Baltimore County Judge Colleen Cavanaugh said a defendant found to pose a \u201clow to moderate risk of reoffending\u201d should stay in the adult court largely because he had missed a lot of school. \u201cWhat gets me,\u201d she said, is \u201cjust the lack of participating in that structure.\u201d Ronald Means, a forensic psychiatrist working with Baltimore youth, said kids charged in adult court often have low IQs or intellectual disabilities. If a defendant\u2019s school doesn\u2019t provide appropriate resources, he said \u201cthey\u2019re gonna start skipping school because they have no chance of success.\u201d Juvenile justice advocates who reviewed the rulings say they\u2019re disturbed by the reasoning offered by Cavanaugh and others for keeping youth in the adult system. But they also cast blame on the law and theDavisdecision that judges must rely on. \u201cLinking the future of a young person to this word \u2018amenability\u2019\u201d is arbitrary, because \u201cit can be defined in any way,\u201d said Mary Ann Scali with the Gault Center, a juvenile justice advocacy group. Judges rarely discuss their cases with the media, and none of those named in this report responded to an email asking them about their rulings. Spokesman Bradley Tanner emailed a statement on behalf of the Maryland Judiciary. While he wouldn\u2019t discuss specific rulings, Tanner noted \u201ca judge must consider many factors rather than just\u201d amenability. Maryland law specifically requires judges address a child\u2019s age, mental and physical condition, the nature of the alleged crime, and public safety in their decisions. Additionally, Tanner said, judges must \u201cdetermine whether a defendant has met their burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that they are amenable to treatment and service available through the Department of Juvenile Services.\u201d An analysis of juveniles who remain in adult court found that most of those who stay in adult court faced felony charges \u2014 some for very violent crimes. In one case, a teenager fired a weapon at a car, missed his target and permanently injured a 73-year-old woman inside a nearby home. In another, a 17-year-old was charged with participating in three carjackings and robberies in a matter of weeks, at one point hitting an Uber driver repeatedly with a gun. In a third, a 17-year-old robbed a woman at gunpoint and led police on a high-speed chase that ended in a crash. During hearings and in interviews, judges and prosecutors questioned the juvenile system\u2019s ability to protect the public. The Department of Juvenile Services estimates 50% of kids who receive their services are rearrested within two years, and 20% are convicted of a crime. Braveboy, the Prince George\u2019s County prosecutor, says the system is broken. \u201cIf I could wave my magic wand, what I would do is have a more robust juvenile system that we could all agree will hold kids accountable, will make public safety the priority, while giving treatment to young people in a way that is holistic,\u201d Braveboy said. \u201cBut that\u2019s not happening in many cases.\u201d Strengthening the juvenile justice system is a top priority for legislative leaders and Maryland Gov. Wes Moore. But the reform bill they\u2019re backing during this year\u2019s General Assembly session does not change the law that lands several hundred teens in adult court each year. Instead, legislative leaders say they want to focus on improving the Department of Juvenile Services. The person Moore appointed to run that system, Secretary Vincent Schiraldi, has said he wants all juvenile cases to start in juvenile court. \u201cMaryland has one of the nation\u2019s highest rates of incarcerating young people in our adult prisons,\u201d Schiraldi told South Baltimore residents at a town hall in December. \u201cSo if simply locking kids up in adult prisons was a solution, we\u2019d already be feeling much safer now.\u201d Although research shows longer sentences do not improve juvenile recidivism rates, judges and prosecutors frequently cite the juvenile system\u2019s shorter periods of probation and detention as reasons to deny transfer. In a transfer hearing early last year, an attorney noted his client\u2019s documented intellectual disability and mental health disorders. He listed the many treatments offered by DJS that medical experts had said would help. But Baltimore City Judge Paul Cucuzzella questioned whether, \u201cgiven the defendant\u2019s extensive needs,\u201d a sentence in juvenile court would \u201cbe of sufficient duration\u201d to prevent the teen from committing another crime. He then ruled that the case should remain in the adult system, which offers little to no treatment. **Policy fails to see \u2018Black and brown children as children\u2019** Initially, only youth charged with crimes like first-degree murder and rape were automatically charged in Maryland\u2019s adult courts. Then, during the \u201ctough on crime\u201d era of the 1990s, state lawmakers added crimes such as carjacking, assault and misdemeanor firearms charges to those excluded from the juvenile system. In 2001, a legislative commission found the changes disproportionately punished Black boys with histories of trauma, mental health needs, and educational difficulties. Since then, little has changed. In 2017, a 16-year-old named Howard Jimmy Davis was charged as an adult after a home invasion. Experts said he was at low risk for future violence and was open and amenable to treatment, but a judge denied his transfer request to the juvenile system. Davis appealed and won his case, and in July 2021, the Supreme Court of Maryland ruled that judges must weigh a teen\u2019s \u201camenability to treatment\u201d above other factors. Since the ruling, judges have transferred more cases to juvenile court. In the six years before theDavisruling, roughly half of the cases involving teens charged automatically as adults were transferred to juvenile court, according to state data. In the two years followingDavis, about two-thirds of cases were transferred. Roughly 8 in 10 juveniles automatically charged as adults over the past five years were Black. Nearly all \u2014 92% \u2014 were male, according to an analysis of state data. Charging children as adults \u201cfeeds into the historic racist practices that we saw \u2014 that started decades and decades ago,\u201d said Natasha Dartigue, head of the Maryland Office of the Public Defender. \u201cIt further feeds into the narrative that fails to recognize our children, especially our Black and brown children, as children.\u201d **Being in prison \u2018makes me want to just give up\u2019** Twenty-one-year-old Dazier Wilson has been locked up since she was charged as an adult with armed carjacking at age 16 in Baltimore City. Wilson had a tough early life. Her father \u201cbasically disowned her\u201d for being gay, and both her father and her stepfather physically abused her, a psychologist told the court. As one of the youngest inmates at an adult prison, Wilson said she became the target of bullying, and experienced depression and thoughts of harming herself throughout her time behind bars. \u201cI'm tired of going through the same thing,\u201d she said. \u201cI can't do nothing about it, and it just makes me want to just give up.\u201d Wilson said she has not had access to therapy but was given antidepressant medication, which she claims is not working. Like Wilson, nearly all of the teens whose cases WYPR and APM Reports reviewed experienced significant trauma before being charged in adult court. Their cases detailed stories of homelessness, physical or sexual abuse, the loss of relatives to gun violence or prison, and acute poverty. The Department of Juvenile Services offers programs specifically designed to treat trauma in adolescents. Each year Maryland taxpayers spend more than $25 million on a long list of programs including mentoring, dialectical behavioral therapy and family systems therapy, both in the community and at its residential facilities. Research shows that therapy reduces individuals\u2019 likelihood of reoffending. Almost every transfer hearing WYPR and APM Reports reviewed included a discussion of the services available in the juvenile and adult systems. At times, judges seemed to believe youth could access programs in the adult system that are rarely \u2014 if ever \u2014 offered. In Maryland\u2019s adult prisons, mental health treatment is generally \u201cself-directed,\u201d social worker Melinda Merlo testified at a transfer hearing last year. \u201cHere\u2019s your workbook, work through this, and then here\u2019s your certificate we give you,\u201d she told a judge. \u201cIt\u2019s not like an actual therapist or an actual person.\u201d One maximum security adult prison has a special program for which teens charged as adults can apply after they turn 18. If accepted, facility officials have said they receive once-a-week group therapy. Prosecutors and judges often held up the existence of the Patuxent Youth Program as an argument to deny teens transfer to the juvenile system. But Means, the psychiatrist, said Patuxent doesn\u2019t have the capacity to treat youth as successfully as the juvenile system, and its staff members are not trained to work with teens. \u201cHaving a youth receive services at the Department of Juvenile Services is always more beneficial than anything they would receive in the adult system,\u201d Means said. Wilson expects to be released from the Maryland Correctional Institution for Women at the end of next month. Because she was locked up so young, Wilson said she doesn\u2019t know how to make a doctor\u2019s appointment, apply for a job or pay a bill. She said she wishes she had access to programs that would help her \u201cmove in the right direction.\u201d \u201cWe all make mistakes and we go through things,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I don't feel as though they should just throw us behind bars.\u201d Emily Haavik, Ellie Roth and Allison Herrera contributed to this report.
