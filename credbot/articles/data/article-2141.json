Who are Erin Patterson and the other key figures in Australia\u2019s mushroom trial? Who are Erin Patterson and the other key figures in Australia\u2019s mushroom trial? Erin Patterson has denied leading health officials on a \u201cwild goose chase\u201d, and that she foraged death cap mushrooms two hours before buying a food dehydrator, a Victorian court has heard. Patterson, 50,faces three charges of murder and one charge of attempted murderrelating to poisoning four lunch guests with beef wellington served at her house in Leongatha, Victoria, on 29 July 2023. Patterson has pleaded not guilty to murdering her estranged husband Simon Patterson\u2019s parents, Don and Gail Patterson, and his aunt Heather Wilkinson, and attempting to murder Ian Wilkinson, Simon\u2019s uncle and Heather\u2019s husband. Lawyers for Patterson say the death cap mushroom poisoning was a tragic and terrible accident. In her seventh day in the witness box, Patterson was again asked repeatedly by Nanette Rogers SC, for the prosecution, whether she agreed with a series of suggestions about the lunch, and her behaviour in the weeks before and after it. Patterson denied that she lied when she told the jury she had an interest in foraging for wild mushrooms, that she told that lie to explain why she put foraged death cap mushrooms in the meal after realising that buying death cap mushrooms was unlikely, and that she changed her position, after telling police she never foraged for wild mushrooms, when she realised that didn\u2019t \u201cstack up\u201d. \u201cForaging for non-toxic mushrooms was not something you did,\u201d Rogers asked her. \u201cDisagree,\u201d Patterson replied. Patterson also denied that she had made up evidence about foraging for mushrooms with her children, despite them saying in interviews with police that they could not recall having done so. \u201cThis is a story you have made up for this jury, agree or disagree,\u201d Rogers asked. \u201cDisagree,\u201d she responded. Patterson also denied that she deliberately bought separate eye fillet steaks as she wanted to make individual beef wellingtons and not because she could not source a single larger \u201clog\u201d of eye fillet, as the recipe had called for. She agreed that she may not have needed to put additional dried mushrooms in the dish, given she had bought enough mushrooms from the supermarket for the recipe, but denied that the dried mushrooms were too \u201coverpowering\u201d to be included in the \u201cspecial\u201d beef wellingtons. \u201cI thought it was the perfect dish for them,\u201d Patterson said. Patterson also denied she had been wrong to tell police she had been \u201cvery helpful\u201d to health authorities who were trying to find an Asian grocer she had bought dried mushrooms from, nor that she lied about buying these mushrooms. Erin Patterson hosts lunch for estranged husband Simon\u2019s parents, Don and Gail Patterson, and his aunt and uncle Heather and Ian Wilkinson. Patterson serves beef wellington. All four lunch guests are admitted to hospital with gastro-like symptoms. Gail Patterson and Heather Wilkinson die in hospital. Don Patterson dies in hospital. Victoria police search Erin Patterson\u2019s home and interview her. Ian Wilkinson is discharged from hospital after weeks in intensive care. Police again search Erin Patterson\u2019s home, and she is arrested and interviewed. She is charged with three counts of murder relating to the deaths of Don and Gail Patterson and Heather Wilkinson, and the attempted murder of Ian Wilkinson. Jury is sworn in. Murder trial begins. Jury hears that charges of attempting to murder her estranged husband Simon are dropped. \u201cYou sent them on a wild goose chase, trying to locate this Asian grocer, correct or incorrect?\u201d Rogers asked. \u201cIncorrect,\u201d Patterson replied. She also said she did not know or suspect that Don and Gail were ill because of eating the beef wellington at the time she decided to feed leftovers of the dish to her children for dinner the night after the lunch. Rogers said it was alleged Pattersonvisited Loch in April and Outtrim in Mayafter posts were made on the website iNaturalist identifying sightings of death cap mushrooms in the nearby towns. Rogers said that Patterson picked death cap mushrooms in Loch on 28 April 2023, and within two hours of finding them went and bought a Sunbeam food dehydrator to dry them. Patterson denied that she had seen the iNaturalist posts, or deliberately visited the towns on the dates in which the prosecution alleges her phone data suggests she did so. The court has previously heard that Patterson dumped the food dehydrator at a local tip the week after the lunch. It was later recovered by police and a forensic examination uncovered her fingerprints and traces of death cap mushrooms. Patterson admits she dumped the food dehydrator, saying she did so in a panic about a visit child protection authorities were planning to make, and the fact she says Simon accused her of using it to poison his parents. Patterson\u2019s supreme court trial at the Latrobe Valley law courts in Morwell will continue on Thursday, when she is expected to give evidence for an eighth day. It is the seventh week of a trial that had been estimated to last five to six weeks.
