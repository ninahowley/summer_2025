What does that mean for Washington?** ByImran Bayoumi It\u2019s not just the money. On Monday, Mark Carney gave his first major defense and security speech as Canadian prime minister. In thespeech, Carney pledged that Canada would reach the NATO benchmark of spending 2 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) on defense this year, well ahead of the previous government\u2019s 2032 deadline. While this announcement garneredheadlines, less attention went to Carney\u2019s reasoning for the increase, which included both an unraveling international order and an increasingly unreliable United States. What might Carney\u2019s view of the current moment and of Washington mean for the United States? Below,Imran Bayoumi, an associate director with the GeoStrategy Initiative in the Scowcroft Center for Strategy and Security, puts the new spending in its full context. **Why is Carney calling for changes now?** Speaking at the University of Toronto, Carneydescribedthe current era as a \u201chinge moment\u201d in Canada\u2019s history. As \u201cthreats from a more dangerous and divided world are unraveling the rules-based international order,\u201d Carney is doing what many leaders of all political stripes in Canada havepledged and failedto do\u2014increase military and defense spending. Recognizing the increasingly volatile international security environment that Canada finds itself in, Carneyannouncedsweeping plans for the government of Canada to increase its defense spending to the NATO target of 2 percent of its GDP by March 2026, ahead of the goal set by the government of former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Canada\u2019s lagging defense spending haslongdrawn the ire of the United States and other NATO allies and served as atargetfor US President Donald Trump earlier this year. Carney likely timed this announcement for this weekend\u2019s G7 Summit, during which Trump will travel to Alberta, and in advance of the NATO Summit in the Hague later this month. Aside from addressing short-term priorities with this month\u2019s summitry, Carney also framed his announcement around the threats to Canada at this moment in history,stating, \u201ca new imperialism threatens. Middle powers must compete for interests and attention, knowing that if they\u2019re not at the table, they\u2019re on the menu.\u201d **What exactly is Canada doing on defense spending?** Canadacurrentlyspends 1.37 percent of its GDP on defense, but the low spending numbers do not tell the full story of Canada\u2019s defense woes. Ottawaonlyhas one operational submarine, out of four, and only half of the Canada\u2019s maritime and land vehicles are operational. Questions surround Canada\u2019s ability to ramp up its domestic defense production at a scale needed to meet Carney\u2019s new goals. Theequipmentused by the Canadian Armed Forces and Canada\u2019s broader defense production as a whole are closely integrated with the United States. Despite this, Carney haspledgedto diversify future defense spending away from an overreliance on the United States and look towards new partners, including Europe, as well as boosting its own capacity for domestic production. **Where will this increased spending go?** In fiscal year 2025-26 alone, the Carney government willinvestan additional $6.5 billion across the Department of National Defence (DND), the Canadian Armed Forces, and the Communications Security Establishment (Canada\u2019s signals intelligence agency). The Canadian governmentaimsto increase the number of full-time armed forces members and reservists alongside investing in the civilian workforce. Part of the spending increase will also come frommovingthe oversight of Canadian Coast Guard from the Ministries of Fisheries and Oceans to the DND. The investment strategy calls forfurthermodernizing Canada\u2019s military capabilities with a focus on the Arctic, such as Canada\u2019srecentacquisition of a new over-the horizon radar system from Australia. To further Canada\u2019s domestic defense production and innovation, the government plans toestablishBOREALIS, the Bureau of Research, Engineering, and Advanced Leadership in Science, which will focus on focus on furthering research in frontier technologies such as artificial intelligence and quantum computing. **How should the United States view Canada\u2019s plans?** Washington has already welcomed Ottawa\u2019s announcement, with US Ambassador to Canada Pete Hoekstrapostingon X that the plan is \u201can important step toward strengthening the Alliance and reinforcing our shared security.\u201d However, a key part of Carney\u2019s strategy is to diversify Canada\u2019s defense investments and partnerships away from the United States. The purchase of the JORN radar system from Australia was Canberra\u2019sbiggestever defense export and took the United States bysurprise. Ottawa is considering bids from bothSouth Koreaand ajointGerman and Norwegian bid to purchase new submarines. Canada\u2019s planned purchase of eighty-eight F-35 fighter jets from the United States is also beingreconsidered, with the DND now potentially looking toward European suppliers. While Washington will welcome Ottawa\u2019s clear, if long-delayed, commitment to investing in its national defense and security, the era when Canada buys heavily from the United States is likely over. As Carneystated, \u201cit is time for Canada to chart its own path and assert itself on the international stage,\u201d and Washington should not take for granted its potential role in Canada\u2019s defense future.
