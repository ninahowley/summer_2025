They were active in over half a dozen theatres: from the Arctic north to the Caspian Sea in the south, from the Far East Pacific to Poland in the west. The intervening armies formed part of what Victor Serge called \u201cthe circle of death of the counter-revolution\u201d.2At times very close to success, the intervention ultimately failed to overthrow the Bolsheviks, ending in a humiliating defeat, which its participants were keen to forget. Both Richard Nixon and Margaret Thatcher gaffed at Cold War summits with their ignorance of this history. It remains relatively unknown today. Anna Reid\u2019s new history, aimed at the general reader and hoping to redress what she describes as the \u201cwilled forgetting\u201d, is therefore to be welcomed.3 One of the chief merits of Reid\u2019s book is its extensive use of participant diaries, some of which are from previously inaccessible private collections and thus new to the existing literature. For example, in December 1919, members of the British Military Mission in South Russia were supporting the White general Pyotr Wrangel, at that time retreating from the revolutionary Red Army in Ukraine. A British sergeant witnessed the savage violence of the counter-revolution: The whole army is running hard and not fighting at all. Wrangel is hanging people all over the place\u2026[for three nights running] men and women accused of being pro-Bolsheviks [were] hanged in the town square. They were not given a drop, but were simply strung up, and drunken Cossacks hewed their arms and legs off with their swords, while the wretched people were still alive.4 In the summer of 1919, Wrangel\u2019s Whites were attacking the Red-held city of Tsaritsyn (later renamed Stalingrad, now Volgograd). They were assisted by the British 47 Squadron Royal Air Force (RAF) flying daily raids over the city. Reid writes: \u201c[A] lucky hit knocked out most of the town Soviet. (A day earlier and it might have got Trotsky on one of his lightning visits to the front.)\u201d Tsaritsyn subsequently fell to the Whites and the 47 Squadron helped Wrangel hold the city for the next six months, \u201cstrafing enemy troop concentrations and bombing trains, depots and a Red river flotilla. Since the enemy lacked planes and air defences it was relatively straightforward work.\u201d Officially, none of these RAF operations were taking place. The British Military Mission in Southern Russia was only supposed to be training and supplying the Whites, but \u201cMinisters dodged questions in parliament with the assurance that it had orders not to join in combat, and [47 Squadron] was renamed and officially merged with a flying school\u201d to maintain the deception. Squadron leader, the Canadian air ace Raymond Collishaw, wrote in a letter: \u201cNone of this made the slightest difference to any of us nor to the squadron\u2019s operations.\u201d They found the Red flotilla riverboats especially easy targets as their anti-aircraft guns had a maximum range of 200 feet: \u201cWe go above at 2,500 feet and laugh at them.\u201d Reid notes the consequent low casualty rate made it easier to carry on the cover up back in Britain. Another RAF veteran, Leslie Kemp, recalled: \u201cWe had no detailed briefings but we were told that there were Bolshevik uprisings in various parts and flew over these villages firing guns and what have you.\u201d Reid writes there is broad agreement among military historians that these RAF operations \u201cterrified and demoralised\u201d the revolutionaries. Sometimes, they made a significant difference. For instance, when a Red Army thrust almost recaptured Tsaritsyn in September 1919, Wrangel\u2019s men were barely saved.5 British air power was also at work in the northern theatre of the intervention, around the Arctic ports of Murmansk and Archangel, deploying a new type of weapon. The \u201cM Device\u201d was an arsenic-based gas canister that could be dropped from the air. From August to September 1919, the British general William Edmund Ironside oversaw the use of almost 3,000 \u201cM Device\u201d canisters on \u201cBolo\u201d (Bolshevik) villages. Ironside confided to his diary: \u201cWe have no evidence as to what effect these things are having\u2026I am certain that they can\u2019t be nice.\u201d Reid writes: The bombs certainly incapacitated, causing violent symptoms\u2014bleeding from ears, nose and mouth, vomiting, giddiness\u2014for up to forty-eight hours, and crippling lassitude after. A member of the British gas team whose respirator failed during a test was still in hospital four months later, and a pilot who crash-landed and got the powder in his wounds lost the use of his arms. What the long-term health damage was to Russian civilians, we do not know. When the British withdrew from Archangel in late September 1919, they refused to hand over their remaining stock of \u201cM Device\u201d to their White Russian allies, instead dumping 47,000 canisters in the White Sea, \u201cWhere\u201d, Reid writes, \u201cthey have presumably been poisoning marine life ever since\u201d.6 One key reason why the intervention failed was the mutinies amongst the White armies. The Allies believed that the Bolshevik regime had little popular support and could be easily toppled. In the north, they oversaw the organising of White Russian forces, only for these efforts to blow up in their face. At Archangel in December 1918, 2,000 Russians mutinied. General Ironside put it down by machine gunning and mortaring the barracks building, then executing 13 of the ringleaders. Reid points out that Ironside\u2019s later published memoirs lied about this, falsely claiming that he had commuted the death sentences. Other mutinies and executions followed, each time the British arrogantly diagnosing poor White Russian leadership as the cause. That diagnosis was exploded when the British-officered \u201cSlavo-British Legion\u201d (aka \u201cDyer\u2019s Battalion\u201d) mutinied in July 1919, killing five British officers. This was a deep humiliation for the British. Reid quotes the diary evidence of major Edward Allfrey\u2019s account of his part in the public execution of 12 mutineers: The execution itself was not a very pleasant sight, as the machine-guns, with their five rounds, only killed about four out of the twelve, and the remainder were left kicking, tied onto big posts. One sergeant had not been touched at all, and I am sure the man behind the gun missed him on purpose. Anyhow, the end of it was that the machine-gunners were doubled off the parade, and we all had to go with our revolvers and polish the prisoners off. When the sergeant, who behaved like a man although he is a murderer, realised that he had been missed, he took the bandage off his eyes and shouted out \u201cLong live the Bolsheviks!\u201d I was glad when somebody fired at him and killed him, for he was uncannily cool and collected. Reid notes how Ironside, very much \u201cgung-ho\u201d when he first got out to Russia, now became \u201cdowncast, stiff and aloof\u201d, turning \u201cabruptly and completely against the Intervention.\u201d Two weeks later, Ironside told the War Office he wanted to evacuate Archangel by 1 October 1918. His diary shows that, by this time, he was less worried about the Reds than the possibility of the whole White army turning on him.7 Things really started to fall apart for the allied forces when mutinies broke out amongst their own troops. The French had despatched 45,000 soldiers to Odessa in December 1918 to overthrow the Bolsheviks and recover the huge investments they had made in Tsarist Russia. Red Army attacks and anti-Intervention sentiment back home forced prime minister Georges Clemenceau into a complete reversal of policy, ordering a total evacuation from Odessa in April 1919. It was then, along the Black Sea coast at Sebastopol, that a full-scale French naval mutiny broke out. Reid writes: Hosing unpopular officers out of their cabins, they announced that they would no longer fire on the Bolsheviks, nor obey any other orders until a date was fixed for their return home. The next morning, to loud cheers, the Red Flag replaced the French tricolour at the two ships\u2019 jack-staffs, and some five hundred French sailors went ashore and joined a pro-Bolshevik demonstration\u2026the crews of all the other French ships in harbour also tore down their tricolours. There followed a panic evacuation: \u201cSubmarines were towed out to sea and sunk, and a wireless station and eight seaplanes smashed with sledgehammers.\u201d By the end of April, France had quit the intervention. Its troops had lasted five months. France now moved to a \u201ccordon sanitaire\u201d policy, leaving the British to continue the fight in the south alone.8 Mutinies broke out among the British forces. In the north, at Seletskoye in February 1919, troops of the Yorkshire Regiment held a mass meeting demanding instant demobilisation and an end to censorship of outgoing letters. Two sergeants were court martialled and each given ten years, but Ironside suspended the sentences. Reports back to London on the low morale and growing indiscipline prompted Winston Churchill, war secretary at that time, to send a message to his troops, urging them to hold out for \u201ca few months more\u201d and to \u201ccarry on like Britons fighting for dear life and dearer honour.\u201d Yet, by late summer 1919, patience had evaporated and the unthinkable happened\u2014a mutiny by the Royal Marines. Reid notes there had been signs of trouble amongst the Marines back in February but oddly omits the episode of the more serious \u201cMarine Mutiny\u201d in August. Another intervention historian, Clifford Kinvig, has detailed what happened. He quotes an investigation report: The men either refused to advance, or if they did, retired as soon as they were fired on; Lewis gun sections threw down their guns in the presence of foreign troops, and, in short, the Royal Corps went through the blackest day in its history.9 It was all too much for the British general Charles Maynard at Murmansk, who \u201cnearly died of a serious heart attack.\u201d Over 90 marines were court martialled and 13 condemned to death but commuted to five years in prison. Kinvig concludes: It was the most substantial and severe disciplinary verdict ever passed on Royal Marines. Thereafter 6 RMLI disappeared from the Royal Marine order of battle and the numeral \u201c6\u201d has not since been connected with any of its combat units.10 One of the most valuable parts of the book is Reid\u2019s documentation of what she calls \u201cthe great stain on the White movement and the Intervention in general\u2014the Whites\u2019 massacres of Jews, and Britain\u2019s connivance in them\u201d.11Reid is right in saying some intervention histories have not given this sufficient attention. The ferocity of White hatred for Jews and Bolsheviks\u2014seen by them as synonymous\u2014resulted in horrific pogroms. One estimate has the Whites being responsible for 200,000 Jewish dead, 700,000 maimed and 300,00 orphans.12The worst of it was in Ukraine. General Anton Denikin\u2019s White armies, ascendant in the south from July to December 1919, directly killed 8,000 Jews in just this six-month period alone. Eyewitnesses stressed how \u201cmethodical\u201d the White pogroms were. Reid documents that the British government was fully aware of what was going on. Unlike some historical accounts, Reid does not take at face value the condemnations of the pogroms by government ministers or their telegram appeals to Denikin to stop them.13Reid\u2019s assessment: For the British government, in short, Denikin\u2019s massacres and mass rapes were a side issue, only of serious concern in so far as they caused political embarrassment. The admonitory telegrams were gestures, not taken seriously and not expected to be. At no stage did the government tell Denikin that unless the pogroms ceased it would withdraw military aid, nor did it even consider doing so. On the contrary, right up to his final defeat new loans and deliveries continued to flow.14 In fact, many of the British senior military personnel in Russia were themselves rabid antisemites. Reid gives several examples, including general Herbert Holman, head of the Military Mission in the South with Denikin. He was \u201cnotoriously antisemitic even by the standards of the time\u2014according to an expatriate clergyman, \u2018obsessed by the idea of wiping out the Jews everywhere and can talk of little else\u2019\u201d.15Reid\u2019s final verdict is suitably damning: Even at the distance of a century, with 1919\u2019s killings long overshadowed by the Holocaust, the fact that Britain knowingly funded, supplied, trained and sent men to fight alongside the armies that committed them is shocking and shameful.16 There is, however, a problem with Reid\u2019s discussion of antisemitic pogroms, specifically on the fact that there were several instances of Red Army pogroms in Ukraine in 1919 and the Polish-Soviet War 1920. Reid quite rightly notes these but the statement \u201cnot only the Whites were responsible; the attacks came from all sides\u201d is much too vague. Why? Firstly, because it skirts over the important fact that the pogroms were overwhelmingly carried out by the Whites. Although no progrom can be justified, a detailed study calculates that only 8.6 percent of those in Ukraine were perpetrated by forces associ\u00adated with the Reds.17Secondly, because there is no recognition of the fact that pogroms were completely contrary to Red policy. A much better analysis is offered by Bruce Lincoln: Certain that they faced extermination if the Whites remained, the Jews of the Ukraine turned to the Bolsheviks, who shot pogromists and outlawed antisemitic writings. From time to time, sporadic pogroms occurred in areas held by the Reds to be sure, but when compared with the tens of thousands of murders by the Whites, the few hundred pogrom deaths that Jews suffered in Bolshevik-held territory left few among them in doubt that Lenin\u2019s regime offered better chances for survival. It therefore was no accident that entire Jewish settlements began to follow Red Army units when they retreated rather than face the tender mercies of Denikin\u2019s soldiers.18 Followers of what Tariq Ali has dubbed the \u201cChurchill Cult\u201d will find little of solace in Reid\u2019s book.19From the moment he was appointed war secretary, Churchill was obsessed with achieving the military overthrow of the Bolsheviks, sometimes provoking rows in Cabinet with his more cautious colleagues. Prime minister David Lloyd George became exasperated, imploring Churchill: \u201cto throw off this obsession, which, if you will forgive me for saying so, is upsetting your balance\u201d.20Lloyd George himself was balancing between giving continued backing to the Whites and the increasingly powerful pressure of the anti-Interventionist \u201cHands off Russia!\u201d movement developing in the British working class\u2014a dimension that receives too little consideration by Reid.21Yet, Churchill persisted, even after the fervent interventionists Clemenceau and Marshall Ferdinand Foch had thrown in the towel.22When Denikin won a spate of victories, Churchill fantasised about being British ambassador in Moscow, helping to write a White Russia constitution. The White advances stalled and turned into a total rout. Churchill privately lamented that the south had become \u201ca complete smash-up\u201d.23Reid fittingly contrasts the chaotic scenes of the March 1920 British evacuation at Novorossiysk with a dejected Churchill sojourned in a French villa, painting watercolours and writing to Lloyd George: \u201cI have been having a complete holiday and trying to forget all the disagreeable things that are going on\u201d.24 The intervention prolonged the civil war by sustaining the Whites with huge levels of military supplies. Take the example of allied support for the White admiral Alexander Kolchak in Siberia. Historian Orlando Figes writes: In the first six months of 1919 his White army received from them: one million rifles; 15,000 machine-guns; 700 field guns; 800 million rounds of ammunition; and clothing and equipment for half a million men. This was roughly equivalent to the Soviet production of munitions for the whole of 1919.25 The prolonged civil war distorted the young Bolshevik regime as it was forced to prioritise a basic struggle for survival. Arthur Ransome, a British journalist in Russia in 1919, reported: \u201cEverywhere I heard the same story: \u2018We cannot get things straight while we have to fight all the time\u2019\u201d.26This journal stands in the tradition that contends it was in these civil war years that the roots of Stalinism first appeared.27Reid rejects this view. To conclude, this book is a liberal history and has weaknesses. Nevertheless, it has merit in that it brings attention to the widely unknown fact of the Allied Intervention. Most valuably, it exposes the complicity and deceit of the British ruling class\u2014above all Churchill\u2014in arming the White counter-revolution and its massacres of Jews. Reid\u2019s book, if read critically, can therefore be usefully studied by socialists seeking to defend the Bolshevik Revolution.
