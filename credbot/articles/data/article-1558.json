Still, Trump\u2019s statement left it vague as to whether he is approving Nippon Steel\u2019s bid after he vowed repeatedly to block the deal to prevent U.S. Steel from being foreign-owned. More recently, Trump suggested that Nippon Steelwould invest in U.S. Steel, not buy it. But investors seemed to take his statement as a sign that he\u2019s approving some sort of merger, sharply pushing up U.S. Steel\u2019s shares, and the companies issued approving statements. Nippon Steel said the partnership is a \u201cgame changer \u2014 for U. S. Steel and all of its stakeholders, including the American steel industry, and the broader American manufacturing base.\u201d U.S. Steel said it \u201cwill remain American, and we will grow bigger and stronger\u201d through a partnership. Nippon Steel\u2019snearly $15 billion bidto buy U.S. Steelwas blockedby former President Joe Biden on his way out of office and, after Trump became president, subject to anothernational security reviewby the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. In his statement Friday, Trump said that \u201cafter much consideration and negotiation, US Steel will REMAIN in America, and keep its Headquarters in the Great City of Pittsburgh.\u201d What Trump called a \u201cplanned partnership\u201d will add $14 billion to the U.S. economy, he said, although it wasn\u2019t clear what the terms of the deal would be or who would control U.S. Steel under the arrangement. Neither company explained Friday how the partnership would be structured. Josh Spoores, the Pennsylvania-based head of steel Americas analysis for commodity researcher CRU, said that, from what he\u2019s seeing, \u201cthis \u2018partnership\u2019 is a green light for the acquisition.\u201d Shares of U.S. Steel jumped 21% on the news, and continued rising in aftermarket trading. Keeping U.S. Steel\u2019s headquarters had always been part of Nippon Steel\u2019s bid to buy it. Tosweeten the deal, Nippon Steel had offered up a $2.7 billion commitment to upgrade U.S. Steel\u2019s two blast furnaces and pledged that it wouldn\u2019t import steel slabs that would compete with the facilities. Nippon Steel also had pledged not to conduct layoffs or plant closings during the term of the existing labor agreement and to protect the best interests of U.S. Steel in trade matters. U.S. Steel\u2019s CEO David Burritt warned last September that blocking Nippon Steel\u2019s bid would mean U.S. Steel would \u201clargely pivot away\u201d from investing in its two blast furnaces \u2014 one just outside Pittsburgh and one in Gary, Indiana \u2014 and it would raise \u201cserious questions\u201d about remaining headquartered in Pittsburgh. U. S. Steel\u2019s board and stockholders approved Nippon Steel\u2019s bid last year. It has been opposed by the United Steelworkers union. The union had no immediate comment Friday. Asrecently as December, Trump said he was \u201ctotally against the once great and powerful U.S. Steel being bought by a foreign company.\u201d Then in February, Trump suggested thatNippon Steelwouldn\u2019t buy U.S. Steel, as it had planned, but that it would instead invest in U.S. Steel. Last month, Trump ordered a new national security review of Nippon Steel\u2019s proposed bid. ___ Levy reported from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.
