June 2025 A new European Alps hydroclimate reconstruction spanning the years 8980 to 2014 CE has been derived from the stable isotopes of 192 trees (Arosio et al., 2025). The reconstruction clearly distinguishes centennial-scale warm periods such as the Medieval Warm Period (MWP), Roman Warm Period (RWP), and millennial-scale African Humid Period (when the Sahara was green, lake- and fauna-covered). These warmer centuries (millennia) were accompanied by wetter, much more humid climates. In contrast, the coldest centuries of the Holocene such as the Little Ice Age (18th and 19th centuries) and Late Antique Little Ice Age (6th century) had the driest hydroclimates with \u201cthe most severe summer droughts of the past 9000 years.\u201d Mass migration punctuated these cold periods. Interestingly, the hydroclimate reconstruction shows the modern period (1900-2014) is no wetter (or warmer) than the 19th century\u2019s Little Ice Age \u2013 the coldest, driest period of the last 9000 years. There has been no dramatic change or \u201cuptick\u201d in the last century. \u201cWe suggest that much of Europe was not only warmer but also wetter during most of the preindustrial Holocene.\u201d Posted inCooling/Temperature,Little Ice Age,Medieval Warm Period,Paleo-climatology|4 Responses **4 responses to \u201cNew Study: Europe Was \u2018Not Only Warmer But Also Wetter During Most Of The Pre-Industrial Holocene\u2019\u201d** kamir bouchareb st6.
