The revelation, amplified byInfowars, has raised concerns about the implications of such a sweeping federal moratorium on AI governance. Advertisement According to Infowars, Rogan broke down the provision during a recent episode, highlighting its potential to centralize AI regulation at the federal level while stifling state-led efforts to address issues like privacy, safety, and discrimination in AI systems. The clause explicitly states: \u201cNo State or political subdivision thereof may enforce any law or regulation regulating artificial intelligence models, artificial intelligence systems, or automated decision systems during the 10-year period beginning on the date of the enactment of this Act.\u201d This is an attempt to created an AI dictatorship. Over all I support the BBB, but this extremely dangerous section MUST be PULLED out of the Senate version. Below Rogan\u2019s quick breakdown, I provide the deep dive..https://t.co/BBdZ5EAwz5pic.twitter.com/JppYPB8ELo \u2014 Alex Jones (@RealAlexJones)June 6, 2025 This measure, if passed, would invalidate existing state AI laws and prevent new ones, affecting states like California, Colorado, and Utah, which have already enacted or proposed AI-related legislation. Infowars\u2019 Alex Jones commented on the issue, describing the provision as an attempt to create an \u201cAI dictatorship\u201d by removing state oversight and potentially giving tech companies unchecked power. Jones, while expressing general support for the bill\u2019s broader objectives, urged that this \u201cextremely dangerous section\u201d be removed from the Senate version of the legislation. His concerns echo those of critics who argue that the moratorium could undermine consumer protections and local governance, leaving AI development largely unregulated at a time when its societal impact is under intense scrutiny. The \u201cBig Beautiful Bill,\u201d which passed the House with a narrow 215-214 vote on May 22, 2025, encompasses a wide range of Republican priorities, including tax cuts, immigration policies, and increased funding for autonomous weapons. However, the AI regulation ban has drawn particular attention due to its potential to reshape the tech landscape. Proponents, such as Rep. Jay Obernolte (R-Calif.), argue that a patchwork of state regulations creates challenges for small startups and innovators, necessitating a unified federal approach. Critics, however, warn that preempting state laws without robust federal alternatives could expose consumers to risks like biased AI systems and unchecked deepfake technologies. The debate over this provision is far from settled, as the bill now faces scrutiny in the Senate, where procedural hurdles like the Byrd Rule could strip the AI moratorium for being non-budgetary. As Rogan\u2019s discussion and Infowars\u2019 coverage have brought this issue to a wider audience, it underscores the growing tension between innovation and regulation in the rapidly evolving AI industry.
