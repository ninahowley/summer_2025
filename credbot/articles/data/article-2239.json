This after being shown upwards of 10 anti-vaccine memes on both Facebook and Twitter. \u201cI shared some of our best stuff with her and she still wouldn\u2019t wake up,\u201d said anti-vaccer Rebecca Johnson. \u201cI mean they were really, really good: stats taken out of context, results of anti-vaccine low quality studies, multiple anecdotes, everything. She must be crazy or something.\u201d Katie said she saw most of the memes that were sent to her, but after a quick check on some medical websites and a chat with a healthcare professional she decided the memes were full of shit. \u201cThe memes actually didn\u2019t make much sense,\u201d explained Katie. \u201cThey were trying to say that the vaccines are worse than the diseases kids can get? Something like that.\u201d Anti-vaccers often attempt to get new moms into their cult by using various methods, the most common of which is misleading and false facts put over pictures of screaming kids. \u201cSome of our best work is done when we find a picture of a child who has died and claim they died of a vaccine injury. Sure, the parents of the child get angry but we are really doing them a favor,\u201d claims Johnson. \u201cIf a child dies, and has ever had a vaccine in their lifetime (or their mother got a vaccine while pregnant), it was vaccines that killed them.
