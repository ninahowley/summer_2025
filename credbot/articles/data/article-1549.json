Party There, the Park Service Says** **Documents show why NPS decided to bigfoot DC after cops requested, then un-requested, the park's closure during Pride.** The National Park Service and the US Park Police announced that they will close Dupont Circle Park between 5 AM Friday and 6 PM Sunday, a window that coincides with multiple celebrations during WorldPride, including DC\u2019s Pride Parade. The decision follows a roller coaster of events. NPSannounced plans to close the parkon Monday evening. On Tuesday morning the Washington Post reported that the Park Service hadcanceled plansto close the park, citinga tweetfrom DC Councilmember Zachary Parker. Documents showed that the DC police requested the closure,then rescinded the request. But strangely, from my perspective as an appreciator of local Park Service spokesperson Mike Litterst\u2019s sterling record of responsiveness to even my dumbest emails, the Park Service remained silent during my many attempts to confirm whether NPS would honor the cops\u2019 second request. On Friday morning, Litterst sent a \u201cRecord of Determination\u201d that includes documents that show why the agencies say they decided to close the park anyway. No statement accompanied the email. The Park Police say that in their \u201cprofessional opinionthis closure is necessary for the maintenance of public health and safety and protection of natural and cultural resources in Dupont Circle Park,\u201d citing \u201cmultiple instances of damage to park resources\u201d in 2019, 2023, and 2024, the same years cited by the DC cops in their letters, according to a letter from National Mall and Memorials Park Superintendent Kevin Griess. (The cops only sentWashingtonianChief Pamela Smith\u2019s rescissionrequest this week; NPS helpfully included the police\u2019s earlier letter, dated April 22, which asked for the closure.) According to a letter from Major Frank Hilsher of the Park Police\u2019s Icon Protection Branch, Smith\u2019s subsequent request \u201cdoes not provide any remedy or solutions to the significant amount of criminal activity and resource destruction that has historically been committed in Dupont Circle Park during DC Pride weekend, or the large strain on law enforcement resources that would be remedied by a park closure with anti-scale fence.\u201dHolsterwrites, \u201cI continue to completely concur with Chief Smith\u2019s first assessment.\u201d Hilsher writes that according to open-source intelligence, the Park Police have \u201cidentified a local DJ advertising and selling tickets to an unpermitted gathering/party in Dupont Circle following World Pride events.\u201d He continues: This event is not sanctioned by the official World Pride organization and has not separately applied for a permit that would enable the NPS to manage the event in such a way that it protects attendees, bystanders, and the cultural resources in Dupont Circle. This social media advertisement is stating that this is the same DJ and \u201cparty\u201d as the previous several years, which have resulted in the unsafe conditions and damages recounted above. The Park Service has traditionally taken a lenient stance toward what it calls \u201cFirst Amendment activities\u201d in the area, and often writes permits on the spot for unpermitted demonstrations. In response to the threat of such a party, anti-scale fencing will surround the park all weekend. You can read the Park Service\u2019s documents below.
