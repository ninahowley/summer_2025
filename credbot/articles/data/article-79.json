For the last two months of their life in the United States, Jos\u00e9 Alberto Gonz\u00e1lez and his family spent nearly all their time in their one-bedroom Denver apartment. They didn\u2019t speak to anyone except their roommates, another family from Venezuela. They consulted WhatsApp messages for warnings of immigration agents in the area before leaving for the rare landscaping job or to buy groceries. But most days at 7:20 a.m., Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s wife took their children to school. **Sign up for our FREE acclaimed newsletters!** The news mainstream media just doesn't cover. Racial justice journalism since 1909. The appeal of their children learning English in American schools, and the desire to make money, had compelled Gonz\u00e1lez and his wife to bring their 6- and 3-year-old on the monthslong journey to the United States. They arrived two years ago, planning to stay for a decade. But on Feb. 28, Gonz\u00e1lez and his family boarded a bus from Denver to El Paso, where they would walk across the border and start the trip back to Venezuela. Even as immigrants in the U.S. avoid going out in public, terrified of encountering immigration authorities, families across the country are mostly sending their children to school. That\u2019s not to say they feel safe. In some cases, families are telling their children\u2019s schools that they\u2019re leaving. Already, thousands of immigrants have notified federal authorities they plan to \u201cself-deport,\u201d according to the Department of Homeland Security. President Donald Trump has encouraged more families to leave by stoking fears of imprisonment, ramping up government surveillance, and offering people $1,000 and transportation out of the country. And on Monday, the Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to strip legal protections from hundreds of thousands of Venezuelan immigrants, potentially exposing them to deportation. Without Temporary Protective Status, even more families will weigh whether to leave the U.S., advocates say. \u201cThe amount of fear and uncertainty that is going through parents\u2019 heads, who could blame somebody for making a choice to leave?\u201d said Andrea Renter\u00eda, principal of a Denver elementary school serving immigrant students. Rumors of immigration raids on schools became a turning point When Trump was elected in November after promising to deport immigrants and depicting Venezuelans, in particular, as gang members, Gonz\u00e1lez knew it was time to go. He was willing to accept the trade-off of earning just $50 weekly in his home country, where public schools operate a few hours a day. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be treated like a delinquent,\u201d Gonz\u00e1lez said in Spanish. \u201cI\u2019m from Venezuela and have tattoos. For him, that means I\u2019m a criminal.\u201d It took Gonz\u00e1lez months to save up the more than $3,000 he needed to get his family to Venezuela on a series of buses and on foot. They sent their children to their Denver school regularly until late February, when Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s phone lit up with messages claiming immigration agents were planning raids inside schools. That week, they kept their son home. \u201cHonestly, we were really scared for our boy,\u201d Gonz\u00e1lez said. In the months following Trump\u2019s inauguration, Denver Public School attendance suffered, according to district data. Attendance districtwide fell by 3% in February compared with the same period last year, with even steeper declines of up to 4.7% at schools primarily serving immigrant newcomer students. Data obtained from 15 districts across eight additional states, including Texas, Alabama, Idaho and Massachusetts, showed a similar decline in school attendance after the inauguration for a few weeks. In most places, attendance rebounded sooner than in Denver. Nationwide, schools are still reporting drops in daily attendance during weeks when there is immigration enforcement \u2014 or even rumors of Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids \u2014 in their communities, said Hedy Chang of the nonprofit Attendance Works, which helps schools address absenteeism. In late February, Gonz\u00e1lez and his wife withdrew their children from school and told administrators they were returning to Venezuela. He posted a goodbye message on a Facebook group for Denver volunteers he used to find work and other help. \u201cThank you for everything, friends,\u201d he posted. Immigrant families are gathering documents they need to return home Countries with large populations living in the United States are seeing signs of more people wanting to return home. Applications for Brazilian passports from consulates in the U.S. increased 36% in March, compared to the previous year, according to data from the Brazilian Foreign Ministry. Guatemala reports a 5% increase over last year for passports from its nationals living in the United States. Last month, Melvin Josu\u00e9, his wife and another couple drove four hours from New Jersey to Boston to get Honduran passports for their American-born children. It\u2019s a step that\u2019s taken on urgency in case these families decide life in the United States is untenable. Melvin Josu\u00e9 worries about what might happen if he or his wife is detained, but lately he\u2019s more concerned with the difficulty of finding work. Demand for his drywall crew immediately stopped amid the economic uncertainty caused by tariffs. There\u2019s also more reluctance, he said, to hire workers here illegally. (The Associated Press agreed to use only his first and middle name because he\u2019s in the country illegally and fears being separated from his family.) \u201cI don\u2019t know what we\u2019ll do, but we may have to go back to Honduras,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to be ready.\u201d Trump\u2019s offer to pay immigrants to leave and help them with transportation could hasten the departures. Gonz\u00e1lez, now back in Venezuela, says he wouldn\u2019t have accepted the money, because it would have meant registering with the U.S. government, which he no longer trusts. And that\u2019s what he\u2019s telling the dozens of migrants in the U.S. who contact him each week asking the best way home. Go on your own, he tells them. Once you have the cash, it\u2019s much easier going south than it was getting to the U.S. in the first place. **Support our Racial Justice Journalism** Since 1909, bringing you the news that mainstream media just doesn't.
