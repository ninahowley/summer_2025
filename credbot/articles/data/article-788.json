In the past, funding from AmeriCorps played a significant role in covering the costs of instructors. However, when federal cuts resulted inAmeriCorps placing the majority of its staff on administrativeleave in mid-April, the Denali Arts Councillost that funding, and it became clear the camp would have to look a little different. Denali Arts Council Executive Director Michelle Crow said a reduced budget for their summer programs is disappointing, but it\u2019s all about moving forward and working with what you have. To cut costs, the Denali Arts Council asked guardians to pack lunches for their children because the camp could not provide lunch for every camper. Additionally, DAC hired one instructor for each art class instead of three as they had in previous years. According to Crow, one of the tougher cuts to the programming was cutting scholarships that helped families afford the camp. \u201cUnfortunately, we had to compensate for that by having fewer scholarships available for our low income students. We were still able to offer scholarships to all of our students in need. It just wasn\u2019t as much as the families are accustomed to,\u201d she said. Even if this year looks a little different, Crow said the Denali Arts Council is committed to providing quality Summer programming for the community. \u201cSo we might have our disappointments, and we\u2019re kind of pulling back in different areas. But as long as the kids come, have a great experience, then everybody\u2019s happy,\u201d she said. **KTNA is sponsored by** **KTNA is supported by** Vivian Waite Swiss Alaska Inn LouAnne Carroll-Tysdal Renamary Rauchenstein **Contact** Office:(907) 733-1700News:(907) 733-1900Studio:(907) 733-1200Email:info@ktna.org Physical: 13764 Second StreetMailing: PO Box 300Talkeetna, AK 99676 Link: FCCOnline Public File Public File Assistance: manager@ktna.org Talkeetna Community Radio, Inc. is funded, in part, by our members, underwriters,and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. **Subscribe to our Newsletter** First Name* Last Name* Email* CAPTCHA"}
