The first brief highlights how this immunity from liability for third-party content empowers Black communities by enabling free expression and fostering innovation, while also examining how the same immunity allows harmful practices to persist. The second brief examines the nuances and legal implications of the statute, specifically how it affects platform moderation practices, including potential biases in content moderation that often disproportionately impact Black users. The third brief explores the implications of various Section 230 reform proposals with a focus on their unique impact on Black communities. Danielle A.
