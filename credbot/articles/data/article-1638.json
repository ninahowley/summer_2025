Newsom Spar Over Federal Response as Immigration Protests Break Out Across U.S.** By Brendan Scanland WASHINGTON, D.C.\u2014 Los Angeles has become the epicenter of a political firestorm after federal immigration raids sparked outrage, unrest and mounting tension between California leaders and the Trump administration. Since Saturday, hundreds have been arrested in Los Angeles amid escalating demonstrations against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and other federal enforcement operations. What began as peaceful protests Friday quickly devolved into chaos. As of early Wednesday, city officials said that at least 30 businesses had been looted. A curfew is now in effect in parts of downtown Los Angeles from 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. The unrest is spreading from coast to coast, with protests erupting in cities including New York, Chicago, Boston and Denver. Thousands have taken to the streets expressing opposition to the immigration crackdown. \u201cRight now in California, what we\u2019re doing is working,\u201d said U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi on Wednesday. \u201cWe\u2019re not scared to go further. We\u2019re not frightened to do something else if we need to.\u201d In response to the unrest, President Donald Trump has deployed 4,000 National Guard troops to Los Angeles, in direct opposition to California\u2019s governor. \u201cDemocracy is under assault before our eyes,\u201d said Gov. Gavin Newsom (D- CA). In addition to the National Guard, roughly 700 U.S. Marines have been mobilized to assist in protecting federal personnel and property. The Marines have reportedly been briefed on the rules for use of force on American soil and are scheduled to begin operations Wednesday. \u201cWe do not want our streets militarized by our own armed forces,\u201d Newsom said on Tuesday. \u201cThese are the men and women trained for foreign combat, not domestic law enforcement.\u201d \u201cYou can have a civil discourse about what\u2019s happening, but you don\u2019t ruin private property and public property,\u201d said Rep. Mike Kelly (R-Pa.), who voiced support for the administration\u2019s decision to send reinforcements. \u201cIf you don\u2019t intercede and you don\u2019t stop it, it will get worse as time goes on,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cIt\u2019s about keeping peace. It\u2019s about making sure that citizens don\u2019t get harmed, don\u2019t get hurt. Public and private property must be protected. Why would you not use the assets you have?\u201d On Tuesday, Rep. Nick Langworthy (R-NY.) introduced theStop Dangerous Sanctuary Cities Act of 2025. The bill seeks to withhold federal funds from sanctuary jurisdictions that prohibit or restrict cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. \u201cSanctuary cities are actively undermining federal immigration enforcement by refusing to cooperate with ICE detainer requests and releasing dangerous criminals back onto our streets,\u201d Langworthy said in a statement. \u201cThe violence we are seeing happen in LA right now is a cautionary tale for New York, another sanctuary state catering to criminal illegal immigrants and left-wing extremists.\u201d Specifically, the bill would block funds from states and cities that do not comply with federal immigration efforts. Additionally, it clarifies legal authority for local and state law enforcement to honor federal immigration detainer requests by deeming officers who comply to be acting as federal agents. The legislation also aims to protect law enforcement by shielding officers and jurisdictions from liability when they cooperate with federal immigration enforcement. \u201cWe must stand with our heroic ICE officers, our men and women in blue, and with the American people who cry out for safety and common sense in their local governments,\u201d said Langworthy. **Get WZMQ 19 anytime, anywhere** Download the app Watch on TV Connect on social media **More** **Manistique invites community and guests to Summer Street Party on June 13** **Former Norway Police officer charged with misconduct** **U.S. Small Business Admin. grants disaster declaration request for counties impacted by ice storm** **FORSYTH TWP.
