Their vessel, theMadleen, sailing under a British flag, was stopped before reaching the Gaza Strip. According to Israeli media, four of the activists agreed to deportation and returned home. The remaining eight, including French European Parliament Member Rima Hassan, declined to sign deportation documents and were taken into custody. They will be held at the Givon detention facility for up to 96 hours before potentially being deported without their consent, as per Israeli law. The activists, associated with the Freedom Flotilla Coalition, had departed from Italy with a small consignment of humanitarian aid. Israel\u2019s Foreign Ministry criticized the mission, calling it a media stunt rather than a serious relief effort, noting that the aid on board amounted to less than a single truckload. Israel emphasized that it has facilitated the entry of over 1,200 aid trucks into Gaza in the past two weeks alone, in contrast to the flotilla\u2019s symbolic gesture. The ministry reiterated that the maritime blockade is lawful and in place to prevent weapons smuggling and other threats from groups like Hamas.

Officials warned that any unauthorized attempt to challenge the blockade is both illegal and dangerous. **Rocket Fired from Gaza Intercepted Near Zikim Beach** The Israeli military intercepted a rocket launched from northern Gaza on Tuesday morning after it triggered warning sirens in the Zikim Beach area, close to the Israel-Gaza border. The rocket was shot down by Israel\u2019s air defense system, and no injuries or property damage were reported, according to a spokesperson from the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). \ud83d\udd34 \ud835\uddd5\ud835\udde5\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddd4\ud835\uddde\ud835\udddc\ud835\udde1\ud835\uddda \ud835\udde1\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddea\ud835\udde6 | Rocket Sirens Return: Zikim Beach area targeted by Gaza terrorists in past few minutesREPORT\u25b8https://t.co/7FopHSAJ0tpic.twitter.com/wEHqFbBBJN Shortly after the incident, IDF Arabic-language spokesperson Lt.

He urged residents in northern Gaza to evacuate, stating that the Israeli military would soon carry out a major operation against terrorist elements in the area. \u201cThe IDF will respond forcefully to any act of terrorism or rocket fire,\u201d Adraee emphasized, advising civilians to seek shelter in designated safe zones within Gaza City. **IDF Uncovers and Destroys Explosives Lab in Tulkarem** Israeli forces uncovered and demolished a bomb-making facility in the city of Tulkarem in western Samaria on June 4, as part of a wider counter-terrorism effort. The discovery was announced Monday morning by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). Troops found gas canisters and other materials used to manufacture improvised explosive devices (IEDs). Additional sites used for building explosive devices and suicide drones were also located during the operation, the IDF said. These actions are part of \u201cOperation Iron Wall,\u201d launched in January to dismantle terrorist infrastructure in Judea and Samaria. Defense officials say the initiative marks a significant shift in Israel\u2019s security approach in the region. The IDF increased its activity in Tulkarem following a failed bombing attempt near Tel Aviv in February, where several buses were targeted. Investigators linked those attacks to the Tulkarem refugee camp. In related operations over the weekend, the IDF, Shin Bet, and Israeli police arrested 35 wanted individuals across Judea and Samaria. Authorities also seized weapons, military equipment, and substantial sums of money tied to terrorist activity. Among those arrested were suspects involved in rock-throwing attacks and other forms of violence against Israeli civilians and forces. According to data from Rescuers Without Borders, Palestinian attacks in Judea and Samaria numbered over 6,300 in 2024 alone, with 27 Israelis killed and more than 300 injured. The incidents included Molotov cocktail attacks, shootings, explosive charges, and attempted arsons. **Share this article** **Related articles** **Huckabee Slams U.S. Media as IDF Hits Hamas Targets and Greta Thunberg Joins Gaza Flotilla Challenge** **More Aid in Gaza, Unrest in Samaria, and Israel Supports Hezbollah Disarmament in Lebanon** **Netanyahu Vows Final Victory in Gaza as IDF Defends Israel from Houthi Missiles and Eliminates Terrorist Behind Fatal Attack** **Follow Us** Opinion Jerusalem IDF Judea & Samaria Israel365 Action Opinion Jerusalem IDF Judea & Samaria Israel365 Action Biblical Archeology SCIENTIFIC INNOVATIONS Terror Watch List of Terror Victims About Us Biblical Archeology SCIENTIFIC INNOVATIONS Terror Watch List of Terror Victims About Us Opinion Jerusalem IDF Judea & Samaria Israel365 Action Opinion Jerusalem IDF Judea & Samaria Israel365 Action \u00a9 ISRAEL365NEWS 2025 Privacy Policy Opinion Judea & Samaria Israel365 Action Jerusalem IDF Biblical Archeology Scientific Innovations Terror Watch Videos Podcasts **Subscribe** Prophecy from the Bible is revealing itself as we speak.
