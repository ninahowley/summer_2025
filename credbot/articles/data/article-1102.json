The 3-year funding package from the Gates Foundation will support PLOS\u2019 transition towards APC-free publishing by enabling authors, funded by the foundation, to publish with PLOS without facing APC barriers, and to contribute to open access publishing options for authors who do not have access to funding. This 3-year grant offers support while PLOS is actively working on new publishing models grounded in open science starting with an ongoingresearch & design project. The grant will also support improvements to enhance the capture and dissemination of funding metadata and to experiment with the posting of peer reviews alongside preprints during the evaluation process, promoting greater transparency in scholarly communication. The transition away from APCs is not a new concept for PLOS, which has been actively developing alternative business models since 2020 with the express aim of reducing financial barriers in scholarly publishing and fostering open access for a broader range of researchers. PLOS has been a vocal champion regarding the benefits of preprints for theearly sharing of researchand has significant partnerships with bioRxiv, medRxiv and earthRxiv. \u201cOur goal is to demonstrate the feasibility of APC-free, open science-based publishing models and inspire a transformative shift across the scholarly communication landscape,\u201d said Niamh O\u2019 Connor, Chief Publishing Officer at PLOS. \u201cWe are grateful for the foundation\u2019s funding support as we explore ways to transition publishing services away from \u2018per published unit\u2019 based pricing and incentivize sharing the form of output most appropriate to the research.\u201d Diversity, Equity and InclusionUpdated version of the \u201cHow Equitable Is It?\u201d tool for assessing equity in scholarly communication modelsMay 14, 2025ByPLOSNote: PLOS, cOAlition S and Jisc issued the following press release on Wednesday, May 14, 2025 [Strasbourg, 14 May 2025] The \u201cHow\u2026Read more Note: PLOS, cOAlition S and Jisc issued the following press release on Wednesday, May 14, 2025 [Strasbourg, 14 May 2025] The \u201cHow\u2026 Note: PLOS, cOAlition S and Jisc issued the following press release on Wednesday, May 14, 2025 [Strasbourg, 14 May 2025] The \u201cHow\u2026 In the NewsPLOS announces new partnership in ChinaApril 1, 2025ByPLOSNote: PLOS issued the following press release on Tuesday, April 1, 2025 San Francisco, California, United States \u2013 The Public Library of\u2026Read more Note: PLOS issued the following press release on Tuesday, April 1, 2025 San Francisco, California, United States \u2013 The Public Library of\u2026 Note: PLOS issued the following press release on Tuesday, April 1, 2025 San Francisco, California, United States \u2013 The Public Library of\u2026 Scholarly publishingPLOS statement on recent US Executive Orders and scientific integrityFebruary 21, 2025ByPLOSSince its founding over twenty five years ago PLOS has been dedicated to advancing open science, ensuring that knowledge is accessible to\u2026Read more Since its founding over twenty five years ago PLOS has been dedicated to advancing open science, ensuring that knowledge is accessible to\u2026 Since its founding over twenty five years ago PLOS has been dedicated to advancing open science, ensuring that knowledge is accessible to\u2026 Bluesky Facebook Linkedin Connect Contact Blogs Advertise Finance Financial Overview Pay Invoice Payment Terms and Conditions Legal Privacy Policy Cookie Policy Terms of Use Accessibility Sign Up"}
