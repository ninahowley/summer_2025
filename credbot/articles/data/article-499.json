Numerical Analysis and Scientific Computation Volume 11 - 2025 |https://doi.org/10.3389/fams.2025.1568834 **New analytical wave solutions of fractional order DMBBM and Bateman-Burgers equations** Department of Mathematic, Faculty of Science, King Mongkut\u2019s University of Technology Thonburi, Bangkok, Thailand The purpose of this article is to explore a new method for solving one of the nonlinear partial differential equations (NPDE) which is difficult to solve. The dispersive modified Benjamin-Bona-Mahony (DMBBM) equation and the solutions of space-time fractional Bateman-Burgers equation is solved by a travelling wave analysis method as the Riccati sub-equation. The solutions of space-time fractional DMBBM equation and the solutions of space-time fractional Bateman-Burgers equation can be expressed in the forms of exponential functions, trigonometric functions, rational functions, and hyperbolic functions. The singular wave, singular kink wave, and periodic wave are the representations of the solution graphs. **1 Introduction** The nonlinear partial differential equations (NPDE) are the partial differential equation (PDE) which have nonlinear terms. The NPDEs are well known for their application of mathematics and physics. Investigating the analytical solutions of NPDEs plays important role in nonlinear science. In fact, NPDEs of physical problems are difficult to solve analytically. At present, there are many alternative methods could obtain exact travelling wave solutions of NPDEs such as Riccati sub-equation (1,15\u201317,19), Kudryashov method (2,18,20),F-expansion method (3),G\u2032G-expansion method (4\u20136) and hyperbolic tangent method. One of interested NPDEs is the nonlinear dispersive modified Benjamin-Bona-Mahony (DMBBM) equation (7,8) which was proposed by Benjamin, Bona and Mahony in 1972. It describes the role of nonlinear dispersion. The DMBBM equation is presented as where\u03b1is a nonzero positive constant andu=u(x,t). However, this method has complicated solutions and still difficult to solve even though the analytical solutions of DMBBM equation are established by using the direct reduction methods and some transformations. The article aims to investigate the travelling wave analysis methods to solve the analytical solutions of the DMBBM (Equation 1) and the Bateman-Burgers (Equation 2) in other ways. In 1915, Harry Bateman presented the Bateman-Burgers equation which is illustrious in the field of applied mathematics such as fluid mechanics, traffic flow and gas dynamics. Bateman-Burgers equation is presented as whereuis a function of variablesxandt,\u03b4is the viscosity of a fluid (1). **1.1 Jumarie\u2019s Riemann-Liouville derivative** The Jumatie\u2019s Riemann-Liouville derivative of order\u03b2respect totis defined as follows (9), The important properties of fractional Riemann-Liouville derivatives are following (10), By combining the fractional Jumatie\u2019s Riemann-Liouville derivative (Equations 3\u20136) with the algorithm of the Riccati sub-equation method, we have found numerous new exact travelling wave solutions of the fractional nonlinear space\u2013time DMBBM equation and the fractional nonlinear space\u2013time Bateman-Burgers equation. Wave behavior graphs in contour, two-dimensional, and three-dimensional plots are demonstrated. Additionally, compared to results from previous approaches, the acquired results showed greater variability. The researcher intends to use the Riccati sub-equation method to determine the exact solutions and analyse the behavior of the fractional nonlinear space\u2013time DMBBM equation and the fractional nonlinear space\u2013time Bateman-Burger equation. This method will provide the exact solution in three different forms: rational functions, generalised hyperbolic functions, and generalised triangular functions. There are a total of 15 distinct solutions. The researcher analysed the behavior of the solution by examining the graph of the solutions in three different formats: contour, two-dimensional graph, and three-dimensional graph. Using Jumarie\u2019s Riemann-Liouville Derivative and its properties, the above procedure must convert nonlinear fractional PDE to nonlinear PDE. Then, it must use the wave transform to convert nonlinear PDE to nonlinear ODE, and finally, the Riccati sub-equation technique to solve the problem further. **2 Methodology** The simple equation method with the Riccati sub-equation for solving the DMBBM equation and Bateman-Burgers equation are illustrated as the following procedures. To begin with, the general form of (1 + 1) dimensional NPDEs. whereuis the functional ofxandt. Considering two independent variablesxandt, the nonlinear conformable fractional partial differential equation is as follows: whereu=u(x,t)andHis a polynomial expression that contains both greatest order and nonlinear factors inu, along with fractional derivatives. **2.1 Step 1. Wave transformation** Setting the wave variable\u03be=kx\u03c8\u0393(1+\u03c8)\u2212\u03c9t\u03c8\u0393(1+\u03c8)wherek,and\u03c9are nonzero with positive direction of travelling wave when\u03c9>0and a negative direction of the travelling wave when\u03c9<0, andU(\u03be)=u(x,t)(11). NonlinearEquation 8can be transformed into an ODE where \u03a6 is a polynomial that contains its derivatives for both largest order and nonlinear factors inU. **2.2 Step 2. Solution supposition** Recall that the solution of the simple equation (SE) method may be expressed in the form (11). whereaiare the real constants withaNis nonzero. The Riccati sub-equation method is used to findV(\u03be)defined as (12,13): Where\u03c1is an arbitrary constant. There are general three cases solutions ofEquation 11shown as follows: Case I: when\u03c1<0, whereQ,Rare nonzero constants withR2\u2212Q2>0. Case II: when\u03c1>0, whereQ,Rare nonzero constants withQ2\u2212R2>0. Case III:when\u03c1>0, wherebis a constant. Thegeneralised hyperbolic functionsinEquations 12\u201318, withpandqare arbitrary constants andp,q>0, are defined as follow, where\u03b8is an independent variable. Thegeneralised triangular functionsinEquations 19\u201325, withpandqare arbitrary constants andp,q>0, are defined as follow, where\u03b8is an independent variable. Substituting the appropriate solutions for case I, II, or III inEquations 12\u201338leads to the general three-case solutions ofEquation 11. Step 3 Finding the integer. **2.3 Step 3. Finding the integerN** The integerN(11) inEquation 10of this method can be obtained by balancing the highest order derivative and nonlinear terms, which are appeared inEquation 9. **2.4 Step 4. Solution obtaining** Collect all the coefficient terms with the same order ofVi,(i=0,1,2,\u2026). Set them to zero (11). The parametersai,,(i=0,1,2,\u2026,N)and\u03c9are obtained. Thus, the analytical solutions ofEquation 7are composed. **3 Application** The travelling wave behaviors were investigated by the fractional nonlinear space\u2013time DMBBM equation and the fractional nonlinear space\u2013time Bateman-Burgers equation shown here. **3.1 The fractional nonlinear space\u2013time DMBBM equation** In this chapter, we apply some travelling wave analysis methods in the previous chapter to solve the analytical solutions of the DMBBM equation with the following methods using simple equation. The nonlinear space\u2013time fractional DMBBM equation, where\u03b1is a nonzero positive constant.Equation 39is transformed intoEquation 40as the following (14): Integrating concerning\u03bechoosing of integration as zero, we obtain the following ODE, Balance the highest order derivative and the nonlinear term. So, we have N = 1. The solution is expressed as DifferentiatingEquation 42yields, and SubstituteEquations 42,44\u201346intoEquation 41, Setting the coefficients ofVito zero, we obtain Solving the system ofEquations 47\u201350, we get and\u03c9=k+2k3\u03c1where\u03b7=\u00b11. The exact solutions of the fractional DMBBM equation are: Type I:when\u03c1<0, whereQ,Rare nonzero constants withR2\u2212Q2>0. Type II:when\u03c1>0, whereQ,Rare nonzero constants withQ2\u2212R2>0. Type III: when\u03c1>0, wherebis a constant,\u03be=kx\u03c8\u0393(1+\u03c8)\u2212(k+2k3\u03c1)t\u03c8\u0393(1+\u03c8). The analytical solutions of the fractional DMBBM equation are shown inEquations 51\u201366. ReplacingEquations 59,60, and66by setting the parameters\u03b1=0.5,b=1,k=1,0\u2264x\u226460and0\u2264y\u226460, the wave of the solutions of the space\u2013time fractional DMBBM equation by Riccati sub-equation can be demonstrated as the followingFigures 1\u20133.

TransformEquation 67into the differential equation, setting the wave variable\u03be=kx\u03c8\u0393(1+\u03c8)\u2212\u03b2t\u03c8\u0393(1+\u03c8)andU(\u03be)=u(x,t)yields, Balance the highest order derivative and the nonlinear term. So, we have N = 1. The solution is expressed as SubstituteEquations 69,43, and44intoEquation 68, we get Setting coefficients ofVito zero, we obtain Solving the system ofEquations 70\u201373, we get The exact solutions of the fractional Bateman-Burgers equation are: Type I:when\u03c1<0, whereQ,Rare nonzero constants withR2\u2212Q2>0. Type II:when\u03c1>0, whereQ,Rare nonzero constants withQ2\u2212R2>0. Type III:when\u03c1>0, wherebis a constant,\u03be=kx\u03c8\u0393(1+\u03c8)\u2212\u03b2t\u03c8\u0393(1+\u03c8). The analytical solutions of the fractional Bateman-Burgers equation are shown inEquations 74\u201389. ReplacingEquations 82,83, and89by setting the parameters\u03b4=0.5,b=1,k=1,0\u2264x\u226480and0\u2264y\u226480, the wave of the solutions of the space\u2013time fractional Bateman-Burgers equation by Riccati sub-equation can be demonstrated as the followingFigures 4\u20136.

The new solutions are more varied than the ones that were previously available: the space\u2013time fractional modified Benjamin-Bona-Mahony (mBBM) equation, which was solved using the modified Kudryashov method, has four solutions (15), while the (1 + 1)-dimensional nonlinear dispersive modified Benjamin-Bona-Mahony (DMBBM) equation, which was solved using the Bernoulli equations, has four solutions (8). In addition, the solution graphs of the equation display periodic waves which are solutions to travelling waves that are periodic, inFigures 1,4. Singular waves, as seen inFigures 2,5, and kink waves, as depicted inFigures 3,6. **5 Conclusion** In this article, the simple equation method has been successfully implemented. The wave solutions for the space\u2013time fractional DMBBM equation and the space\u2013time fractional Bateman-Burgers equation are found using the Riccati sub-equation. This method releases fifteen solutions with independent parameters in the form of generalised triangular functions and generalised hyperbolic functions which are considered to describe some intricate physical phenomena. This research shows some physical wave behavior graphs in three-dimensional plots. BothFigures 1,4are exhibit periodic wave solutions which increase and decrease,Figures 2,5show singular solutions and singular kink wave solutions were presented inFigures 3,6. Based on the results, the Riccati sub-equation methodology is an effective, dependable, and efficient method that provides new solutions to these equations and shows the wave impacts of those solutions in different ways. **Data availability statement** The original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/supplementary material, further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding author. **Author contributions** NS-I: Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing \u2013 original draft.
