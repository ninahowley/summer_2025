Wyoming news. **State biologists warned of wildlife conflicts at proposed shooting complex site. Wyoming approved the location anyway.** Over 21,000 Wyomingites get WyoFile delivered straight to their inbox.Join your neighbors and stay informed with the stories shaping Wyoming. When atask force of lawmakers and appointed citizensdecided last summer where best to locate a state-funded destination shooting facility, they chose a picturesque 3-square-mile tract of state land nestled into the Absaroka Range foothills. Their rationale, in part, was that the site evoked wild Wyoming. Rolling hills blanketed in sagebrush, the location is home to elk, mule deer, pronghorn and sage grouse, among other species. It boasts spectacular views of high peaks leading to the Yellowstone plateau and, off to the east, the Bighorn Basin. Bisected by Sulphur Creek, the site feels like it\u2019s in the middle of nowhere despite being just an 8-mile drive from Cody. Those same attributes concerned Wyoming\u2019s wildlife managers, according toan agency reviewof the proposal acquired by WyoFile through a Wyoming Public Records Act request. **As a WyoFile member, you make stories like this possible.Thanks for being on our team!** Seven days before the 12-member task force voted 8-4 in favor of the location, the Wyoming Game and Fish Department issued a memo that effectively recommended the complex go elsewhere. Specifically, Habitat Protection Supervisor Will Schultz asked that it be moved outside of \u201ccore\u201d sage grouse habitat and \u201ccrucial\u201d range forstruggling mule deer, which exhibited \u201chigh use\u201d of the site throughout the year according to GPS collar data. Pronghorn and elk also used the 2,036-acre property, which is slated for development into a world-class shooting operation, and is expected to draw gun enthusiasts from far and wide. \u201cGround-disturbing activities and extensive human presence can result in the disturbance or displacement of wintering big game and loss of habitat, potentially impacting the viability of local populations,\u201d stated the July 15, 2024 letter signed by Schultz. One week later, the state agency\u2019s concerns surfaced as the task force voted. \u201cIs this cleared for that wildlife aspect?\u201d Republican Rep.Pepper Ottman of Riverton asked her fellow members. \u201cIt looks to me as though that is still a concern. What would that look like, to alleviate that concern? I\u2019m not sure. That is of grave concern.\u201d Nobody attempted to answer the questions. **\u2018Of grave concern\u2019** Ottman, who\u2019s no longer on the task force, voted with the minority for the runner-up site, near Gillette. She told WyoFile in an interview that she asked about the wildlife concerns because she wanted to get ahead of them \u2014 and wants theWyoming State Shooting Complexto be successful. \u201cI\u2019m going to support the decisions that were made,\u201d Ottman said. No one other than Ottman, including the agency itself, raised Game and Fish\u2019s wildlife concerns with the Cody site to the task force. Nor did the state agency\u2019sreview of the alternative Campbell County site, which detailed far fewer concerns with wildlife, make much of an appearance in the debate. Publicly, there has been little to no discussion about requests to avoid the crucial mule deer range and the Oregon Basin sage grouse core area, or of any other wildlife-friendly guidance that\u2019s been issued for the Park County shooting complex site, where construction crews could break ground as soon as July. Powell resident Greg Mayton, who spent 14 years working for Wyoming Game and Fish, said that the wildlife concerns were minimized because of a \u201ctop-down push\u201d that has kept the agency\u2019s Cody Region personnel muzzled. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t look good,\u201d Mayton said, \u201cif Game and Fish was against this site.\u201d WyoFile\u2019s attempts to talk with regional personnel were not successful \u2014 an in-person inquiry at the Cody office in early May prompted a phone call from the agency\u2019s Cheyenne headquarters. An avid hunter, Mayton is among the few Park County residents who\u2019ve spoken out against the shooting complex. The former aquatic invasive species biologist has spent ample time hunting elk and mule deer andlooking for shed antlerson the selected state land, which abuts a much larger expanse of Bureau of Land Management property west of Highway 120 between Cody and Meeteetse. He feels local residents have to unfairly subsidize a commercial enterprise they might not want in the first place. \u201cWe have to pay for it three times,\u201d Mayton said. \u201cThrough county money I\u2019m paying to build the road, through Game and Fish dollars, and then through all the state tax dollars.\u201d Wildlife managers were more forward about their concerns earlier in the Park County site-selection process, according to Andy Quick, a former Cody town councilor. \u201cThey were going to pursue a different area north of town [near Skull Creek] that was really a bad idea,\u201d Quick said. \u201cThat was a designated elk parturition area. The Game and Fish was a little more vocal about that one.\u201d Like Mayton, Quick isn\u2019t a fan of the planned commercial operation, which the Wyoming Legislature funded to the tune of $10 million last session. The allocation required somelast-minute maneuveringafter thesupplemental budget, which included funding for the complex, unexpectedly died. \u201cIt\u2019s just going to fracture more habitat and it\u2019s just one more step in the wrong direction, as far as I\u2019m concerned,\u201d Quick told WyoFile. \u201cI think recreation and hunting are also going to lose out. I know that the state land can be managed as de facto private land, which is inherently a problem in and of itself.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s just going to fracture more habitat and it\u2019s just one more step in the wrong direction.\u201d There\u2019ve been several more visible scuffles of late over industrial and commercial use of state lands. Those includeopposition to a gravel pitjust outside of Casper, a lawsuitover a commercial wind farmin Converse County and a fight over aglamping operationat the foot of the Tetons that has spurred calls for reform and possibly legislation. The Wyoming State Shooting Complex has so far advanced with comparatively little controversy, at least in public. Quick, the former Cody town councilor, said that he was well in the minority among local elected officials. \u201cI was probably the only one that was against it,\u201d he said. **A defense** Former Park County Commissioner Lee Livingston, who works as a big game outfitter, championed the project. He helped shepherd it through the county board, and was a part of the county working group that helped preparea 241-page proposalpitching a complex south of Cody. Livingston told WyoFile in May that Game and Fish gave the location the \u201cgreen light.\u201d \u201cI think anywhere you go in Wyoming, you can call it habitat,\u201d Livingston said. \u201cOverall, I think it\u2019s probably about the best location it can be in that Cody area.\u201d Other project proponents made similar contentions. Nephi Cole, a Sheridan-based lobbyist for the National Shooting Sports Foundation, said it\u2019s hard to find a location in Wyoming that doesn\u2019t have wildlife impacts. He also expressed hope that species would adjust to the gunfire, infrastructure and human activity likely soon to be added to the Absaroka foothills. \u201cOther large ranges, they\u2019re typically fairly non-invasive, believe it or not, for wildlife,\u201d Cole said. \u201cThey accustomize to it, they don\u2019t view it as a hindrance. You end up getting deer, antelope and elk all over ranges, to the extent you have to move them for competitions to make sure that they\u2019re not around targets.\u201d Baggs Republican Sen. Larry Hicks, whose2023 legislationspearheaded state planning and funding for a Wyoming State Shooting Complex, said he has witnessed the harmony between wildlife and recreational shooting atColorado\u2019s Cameo Shooting Complex. \u201cThey got bighorn sheep, mule deer on the shooting range,\u201d Hicks said. \u201cChukars all over the place.\u201d Hicks expects something similar in Park County. Long-range shooting on the state site\u2019s west end \u2014 there areplans for mile-long targets\u2014 are \u201cprobably going to have almost no impact\u201d on wildlife, he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not going to be an everyday, ongoing type of activity,\u201d he said. \u201cSeasonal use makes a difference. We can work around some of that just by event scheduling. We\u2019ve got to put together a mitigation plan.\u201d Glenn Ross, who chairs theWyoming State Shooting Complex Joint Powers Board, said that Wyoming\u2019s concerns about wildlife impacts have been considered from the get-go and baked into the plans. \u201cOur planning with our site has been making every attempt to be wildlife friendly,\u201d Ross told WyoFile. Wildlife impacts, he said in a follow-up email, were a \u201cprimary consideration\u201d in selecting the more southern Park County site before the local working group submitted itsformal applicationto the state in June 2024. That proposal does include some wildlife-focused plans. For example, core sage grouse habitat, which covers about a square mile of the site, would receive \u201cminimum development\u201d to avoid exceeding the 5% threshold authorized by Wyoming\u2019s policy forthe embattled bird,which isparticularly sensitive to noise. Mule deer, whose designated \u201ccrucial\u201d range covers almost the entire 2,036-acre site, would be accommodated by adjusting management west of a ridgeline during the winter, \u201cminimizing the overall impact.\u201d \u201cMule deer, although quite adaptive to human presence, still need areas of shelter and forage in the critical winter months,\u201d Park County\u2019s application stated. Elk and pronghorn, meanwhile, would be encouraged to stick around. \u201cBecause having these species on site can be of tremendous value to our customers, the complex will recognize that value and work to operate the facility in harmony with these species,\u201d the planning document reads. **Next steps unclear** A month before a likely groundbreaking \u2014 Ross expects to receive the $10 million authorized by the Legislature in July \u2014 it\u2019s unclear what actually will be required to minimize harm to wildlife along 3-plus square miles of the Absaroka front. Althoughwildlife managers\u2019 site review of the Park County locationis printed on Wyoming Game and Fish Department letterhead and addressed to an outside legislative task force, the document was described as \u201cinternal department correspondence\u201d when it was conveyed to WyoFile via a records request. It\u2019s not considered an \u201cofficial project letter,\u201d Game and Fish officials said. \u201cWe have not submitted any formal comments on the Cody shooting complex,\u201d Wyoming Game and Fish Chief Warden Dan Smith told WyoFile. \u201cAnd we haven\u2019t been requested for any [comments].\u201d The Office of State Lands and Investments will decide whether Game and Fish formally comments, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s up to them,\u201d Smith said, \u201cwhether they request us to make comments on their project.\u201d Because the Wyoming State Shooting Complex is set to occupy state trust land, the permitting authority is the Office of State Lands and Investments. Its oversight board, the State Board of Land Commissioners, has already approved the Cody complex, according to Melissa DeFrantis, a public information officer for the state agency. \u201cThey\u2019ve approved going forward with it,\u201d DeFrantis said. \u201cWe will take the lease to them once it\u2019s complete.\u201d Tired of the noise?We\u2019ll send you the facts, straight to your inbox. The State Board of Land Commissioners consists of Wyoming\u2019s five statewide elected officials: Gov. Mark Gordon, Superintendent of Public Instruction Megan Degenfelder, Secretary of State Chuck Gray, Treasurer Curt Meier and Auditor Kristi Racines. Until the board approves the lease, the draft version and its contents \u2014 such as wildlife stipulations \u2014 are not considered public information, DeFrantis said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what the negotiations may be,\u201d she said. \u201cA draft, it really wouldn\u2019t benefit you right now.\u201d The Office of State Lands and Investments had a different interpretation of what triggers a formal Wyoming Game and Fish Department project letter. Those are typically prepared by default for state land leases, DeFrantis said. But DeFrantis also said she was unaware if Game and Fish would formally review the Wyoming State Shooting Complex\u2019s lease near Cody. \u201cI can\u2019t say, I\u2019m not drafting the lease,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I can say that that\u2019s generally the process, and I don\u2019t know why we would avoid that.\u201d The Office of State Lands and Investment\u2019s lead on the project, Cody Booth, did not return a phone call requesting an interview. If Wyoming Game and Fish does proceed with a formal review and the requested stipulations mirror those in itsexisting site review, the Wyoming State Shooting Complex could be saddled with significant restrictions that inhibit its construction and operations. Because the project isn\u2019t being moved outside of the core sage grouse area, construction and development \u201cshould not occur\u201d between March 15 and June 30 in that designated core habitat and within 2 miles of a nearby non-core area lek, according to Game and Fish\u2019sexisting guidance. Furthermore, Game and Fish asked shooting complex proponents to develop \u201ca noise mitigation plan\u201d so gunfire doesn\u2019t compromise an occupied core-area lek that\u2019s three-quarters of a mile south of the complex. \u201cResearch has indicated that the declines in male lek attendance in response to increased noise are immediate and sustained,\u201d the state\u2019s letter stated. \u201cFurther, sage grouse do not appear to habituate to increased noise levels over time.\u201d **RELATED** **\u2018Path of the Pronghorn\u2019 protections delayed as development proceeds** **How to decimate a mule deer herd: A case study in Wyoming** Crucial year-round range used by the Upper Shoshone Mule Deer Herd could impact shooting complex operations even more if requested wildlife stipulations are heeded. The herd has struggled mightily: The estimated 6,850 deer in the herd fall more than 40% short of the herd\u2019s 12,000-animal population target, according toGame and Fish\u2019s latest assessment. Because the complex wasn\u2019t relocated outside the \u201ccrucial\u201d deer range, which overlapped almost the entire site, Game and Fish\u2019s instruction was to \u201cavoid ground-disturbing activities and extensive human presence\u201d from Nov. 15 to April 30. Mule deer-friendly practices, in other words, could theoretically shutter the destination shooting complex nearly six months a year.

I won\u2019t be traveling to either place, either way, at least not to go to a shooting complex. Why must wildlife always take the back seat to development?

Again it happens. Wyoming will never be the same. Too much development. Not just there, but across the entire state. I suppose \u201cprogress\u201d is inevitable, it\u2019s just sad to see what once was is now forever gone. What a lousy idea to put this shooting complex in that spot, especially when the Gillette location is way less wildlife intrusive. I won\u2019t be traveling to either place, either way, at least not to go to a shooting complex. Why must wildlife always take the back seat to development?

Anne Brandesays:June 7, 2025 at 10:39 amOur conservancy in SE Wyoming is compelled to point out Rail Tie Wind, Albany County\u2019s largest wind energy project is also on state lease land and not only will have negative impacts due to large scale 675 ft. turbines affecting pronghorn, mule deer, elk, and moose as well as \u201cspecies of greatest conservation need\u201d it also has the impacts of a large scale commercial quarry to provide gravel for this project the county\u2019s largest wind project to date which has over 90 stream crossings and did not do a federal wet lands study as required by the EPA . Rail Tie Wind sits between Arapahoe National Forest and Medicine Bow National forest along the HWY287 and the I80 Corridor. The the Rail Tie Wind project area contains 480 nationally significant historic and cultural sites and therefore should have in the mitigation process designated these sites as a national historic district due to the pristine condition and integrity of sites identified. In 2021 Albany County residents sued in WY Supreme Court regarding the denial and subsequent approval to lease to Spanish Company Repsol then Houston basted Connect Gen who sold later sold Rail Tie Wind for $485 million dollars to Repsol in November of 2024. After the WY state land board voted against leasing to Connect Gen and under very questionable actions the Land Board rescinded and the lease was up for vote again only a few months after the board voted to deny the lease approval initially. The public learned state lease was back on the table yet it was not on the meeting agenda for public comment. The public demanded to make comment. After five hours of contentious public comment against leasing the board approved to lease the only no vote was cast by State treasurer Meyer. That in itself should be telling.A letter from Game and Fish regarding the impacts to ungulates and species of greatest conservation need was also produced as in this case with the same response from Wyoming Game and Fish. The Wyoming public was then forced to look to federal inadequacies for protection our state was not willing to weigh in on. Rail Tie Wind sits near a major federal power line and and was mandated to conducted a full Environmental Impact Statement, the most rigorous of federal National Environmental Policy Act reviews required. This law suit was published WyoFile earlier this year 2025. In Rail Tie there is a federal 110F violation under the National Historic Preservation Act Section 106 process. Wyoming residents need to stay informed and involved in state and federal land management. They can not rely on county, state, or federal government to follow sound practices until things of this nature as covered in your article are addressed. And more importantly until Wyoming Game and Fish staff feel comfortable speaking with integrity regardless of top down directives. We have learned from Rail Tie Wind laws are being broken which will forever impact Wyoming natural resources at the county, state, and federal level. Wyoming is at the precipice and if we do not unite as Wyoming residents to communicate locally, state wide, and federal we stand by and allow the promise of big money to dictate our future, often without in state key stake holders making long term positive improvements to a broken system. Litigating to preserve, protect, and promote Wyoming wildlife, habitat, and pristine historic sites of tremendous national and local value was our only option.

Greg Huntersays:June 6, 2025 at 8:19 amI have been watching and commenting on this complex since its proposal, so I have been waiting to see if any of my concerns were addressed. The answer is a resounding NO.I have been involved with evaluating shooting ranges since 1988 from indoor units in the basement of National Guard facilities to the ones operated by the US Army at Fort Knox and Campbell. One of the biggest things that all these activities overlooked was the deposition and migration of lead (Pb). Since 1988, indoor ranges have been closed or significantly modified to reduce the lead exposure to the shooters, but outdoor ranges are another story. These ranges have lead (Pb) spread from the blast zone all the way down range to where the projectile lands. Every outdoor range I have ever evaluated generates far more motile lead (Pb) than has been perceived by the operators or the public.During a committee meeting I recommended that a representative from Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality be added to the Wyoming State Shooting Complex Joint Powers Board, but that did not happen.I have just searched the 241 page proposal and there was exactly one mention of lead (Pb) in the entire document with a reference to Appendix 14, which I cannot find. Oh well, I guess those happy humans and animals will enjoy frolicking in the lead (Pb) and noise generated by this wonderful operation. Just ask Senator Hicks or the Firearms Research Center.Reply I have been watching and commenting on this complex since its proposal, so I have been waiting to see if any of my concerns were addressed.

Rick Jonessays:June 6, 2025 at 7:35 amOh no, not another Cody region blunder, both ecologically and economically.
