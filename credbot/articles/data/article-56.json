Credit: arvin.temkar@ajc.com Turnout is so low in Georgia\u2019s rescheduled, off-year, summertime elections for Public Service Commission that several counties are considering closing polling places if there\u2019s a runoff. Voters are showing little interest in a primary election that could have tremendous impact on their wallets: The PSCsets the power and gas ratesthat monopoly utility companies can charge. About half a percent of registered voters had voted in nearly two and a half weeks of early voting so far. That\u2019s about 45,000 ballots cast out of 8.4 million registered voters through Tuesday. Election Day is next Tuesday, June 17. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the lowest turnouts we\u2019ve ever had,\u201d said Janis Judge, assistant elections director for Cherokee County. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a lot of information out there. I don\u2019t hear about it on the news that often. And the cost to the county is a fortune this election.\u201d She estimated the budget for the election is over $50,000. Without another major race on the ballot, such as president or governor, and relatively muted campaigns among the eight candidates, voters aren\u2019t motivated to participate, election officials said. The result could be fewer precincts if a runoff is required next month, which is very possible in the four-candidate Democratic primary for one of thetwo PSC seats on the ballot. Georgia law calls for runoffs when no candidate receives a majority of votes. If turnout fails to exceed 1% in the partisan primary, counties are considering ararely used state lawthat allows them to only open one precinct in a runoff, said Travis Doss, president of the Georgia Association of Voter Registration and Election Officials. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely interest out there to do this as a cost-saving measure,\u201d said Doss, executive director for Richmond County elections. \u201cUnfortunately, as important as the PSC is, it\u2019s a little-known office, and it\u2019s not one that drives people to the polls.\u201d So far, Cherokee and Floyd counties are two Republican-majority counties that could reduce voting locations in a runoff. Others could follow if their turnout remains below 1% after Election Day. Credit: arvin.temkar@ajc.com Credit: arvin.temkar@ajc.com In Doss\u2019 county, the runoff could cost taxpayers about $160,000 for poll workers and staff overtime, but turnout is likely to exceed the 1% threshold that would allow polls to close. Floyd County Elections Director Akyn Beck said she could save at least $25,000 in taxpayer money if the number of voting locations drops to one for a potential runoff. \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing because we put in the same amount of preparation, and we see such low voter involvement,\u201d Beck said. \u201cA lot of people don\u2019t even know what these commissioners actually do for their constituents.\u201d The timing of the election \u2014 held in June rather than in an even-numbered year with other statewide races \u2014 wasset by the Georgia General Assemblyafter lawsuits led to thecancellation of previous PSC electionssince 2022. A federal judgeruled three years agothat electing PSC candidates statewide rather than by districts violated the Voting Rights Act, resulting in almost all-white representation on the PSC during its 146-year history. But then an appeals courtoverturned his decision, allowing lawmakers to reschedule the elections. Credit: Miguel Martinez/AJC Credit: Miguel Martinez/AJC Helen Butler, a voting rights advocate, said fewer polling places in a July runoff would further curtail turnout. \u201cI understand the costs involved, but voters should have access. In a runoff, it\u2019s critical that voters choose the person that\u2019s going to make the best decisions,\u201d said Butler, executive director for the Georgia Coalition for the People\u2019s Agenda, a civil rights organization. Turnout was much higher in last year\u2019s presidential election, whennearly 5.3 million voters participated, with 71% of them casting their ballots during three weeks of in-person early voting. For this election, even early voting sites with relatively higher turnout, such as the Cobb County elections office, seemed like ghost towns, with just a handful of voters per hour. Dennis Flanagan, a retired IT worker from Marietta, said he hopes voters start paying more attention. \u201cIt\u2019s very important. The utilities have been running roughshod over the citizens of Georgia,\u201d Flanagan said. \u201cI just cast my vote and hope it counts. I wish we had better education about these issues.\u201d After the primary and a potential runoff, the winning candidates from the Republican and Democratic parties will meet in the general election in November. **How to vote for Public Service Commission** All registered voters in Georgia are eligible to vote in both Public Service Commission races on the ballot.
