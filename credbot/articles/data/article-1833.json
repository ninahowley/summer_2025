They knew it was not safe at all, and the FDA also knew Pfizer committed fraud to get the CV19 injections approved. Kingston says,\u201cThis is the government\u2019s words exactly: \u2018The FDA was aware of the protocol violations.\u2019So, the FDA was aware of the fraud that was reported . . . before it granted emergency use authorization (EUA) for its vaccine. They were aware of the fraud. Second, the government said it \u2018had continued access\u2019 to the Pfizer vaccine clinical data, and \u2018in the FDA\u2019s view, Pfizer\u2019s vaccine is effective.\u2019 Notice they dropped the word \u2018safe.\u2019 The minimum bar is safe before effective, but they intentionally dropped the word safe. . . . They ignored safety. For the last five or six years, the FDA\u2019s mantra has been to sacrifice safety and disregard disabilities, disease and death that vaccines and gene editing products cause in children and adults in the name of science. . . . They (FDA) had access to the data, and my point is the whole immunity (for Pfizer) is null and void because they co-conspired to commit fraud by withholding safety information of willful injury battery and murder of adults and children. Under the vaccine law, it says the manufacturer shall not be held liable for punitive damages unless they are engaged in fraud or intentional withholding information. . . or other criminal or illegal activity relating to the safety and effectiveness of vaccines.\u201d The government and Pfizer knew the CV19 vaccines were not safe. Kingston says, \u201cIn 2020, they met and listed out Myocarditis. Pericarditis, neurological malfunctions, respiratory failure, multiple system inflammatory disease, Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, and they listed everything out except for cancer. So, they knew the CV19 vax would cause all those debilitating injuries, infertility and death. . . . Taking the CV19 shots off the childhood vaccine schedule is not enough. These shots, by definition, according toPresident Trump\u2019s Executive Order yesterday,are dangerous bioweapons. That\u2019s what these shots are, and you can go through President Trump\u2019s criteria, and they meet that criteria. So, these shots need to be taken off the market and not be found in any community in the United States of America, or in any community around the world at this point. . . . The information has been there. It\u2019s been in our face, and we have gone along with being gaslit and saying the Trump Administration doesn\u2019t know, and once they know, they will make a change. Well, the Trump Administration, our current Administration, just put in writing, yeah, we know the CV19 vax is fraud. We don\u2019t care, and we are not changing our mind. That\u2019s a tough pill to swallow.\u201d In closing, Kingston points out they want to put so-called mRNA in everything to fight cancer, but all the studies for the past several decades on mRNA say it causes cancer. Kingston says, \u201cPfizer is telling us we are putting in faulty genes. We are debilitating you. We are disabling you. We are sterilizing you, and we are killing you. We are directing the evolution of human beings to become more weak and more dependent on us. . . . To survive, you will need us. It\u2019s on their website. It\u2019s called \u2018directed evolution.\u2019 They are directing the extinction of our species. That is what this is. They are playing God. . . .You can call it eugenics. You can call it depopulation, but the new word is \u2018directed evolution.\u2019 It\u2019s mRNA technology or personalized medicine, it\u2019s all the same thing.\u201d There is more in the 80-minute interview.

That kind of thinking I find profoundly sad.Consider though\u2026\u2026.the terrorist who takes an aircraft and its\u2019 passengers hostage (this used to happen in the 1970s, and was actually called \u201cterrorism\u201d. In 2025, just speaking \u201cthe wrong thing\u201d can get you labelled a \u201cterrorist\u201d)The terrorist stands up in the aeroplane and declares that his God is the one true God\u2026\u2026all others are under the control of the Devil and must die. That this act is the will of his God\u2026\u2026that the \u201cothers\u201d are simply mislead, lied to heathens who have refused to believe in \u201cthe one true God\u201d, and therefor, his deed of slaughtering all of them is justified by his God.Sound familiar?That\u2019s not God in any way, shape or form (and please, spare me any Bible passages that allude to justification of the slaughter of innocent people in the name of \u201cdefending God\u201d).God never has, never will need to be defended by human beings. The bible was not written by God\u2026\u2026.it was written by human beings. Greg has also pointed out that it has been edited , as Greg has said that the name \u201cJehovah\u201d has been edited out many, many times.It\u2019s a heavily edited collection of accounts / stories / reflections / parables and ideas written by human beings\u2026\u2026.none of it has been written by God Himself and that is a fact.Yes\u2026\u2026we are all sinners.There is a genocide going on at present\u2026\u2026it is in no way a Holy thing.

That this act is the will of his God\u2026\u2026that the \u201cothers\u201d are simply mislead, lied to heathens who have refused to believe in \u201cthe one true God\u201d, and therefor, his deed of slaughtering all of them is justified by his God. Sound familiar? That\u2019s not God in any way, shape or form (and please, spare me any Bible passages that allude to justification of the slaughter of innocent people in the name of \u201cdefending God\u201d).God never has, never will need to be defended by human beings.

Because you have rejected knowledge, I will also reject you from serving as my priest; And because you have forgotten the law of your God, I myself will forget your sons.\u201dCLE, this verse is a lament from Jehovah, expressing sorrow over the spiritual decline of Israel. The people had abandoned divine wisdom, leading to their downfall. The rejection of knowledge wasn\u2019t just ignorance\u2014it was a deliberate turning away from God\u2019s guidance. As a result, Jehovah declares that He will reject them from serving as His priests, severing their spiritual privileges.The phrase \u201cI myself will forget your sons\u201d is particularly striking. It underscores the generational impact of forsaking divine instruction. When a nation or community neglects spiritual truths, the consequences ripple through future generations, leading to moral decay and estrangement from God.CLE, imagine a grand library filled with books of wisdom, each containing divine truths meant to guide humanity. The people of Israel, however, chose to ignore these books, letting them gather dust. Instead, they turned to fleeting pleasures, corrupt leaders, and false idols. In doing so, they lost their moral compass, and Jehovah\u2014like a disappointed teacher\u2014had no choice but to let them face the consequences of their choices.This verse also resonates with modern times. Many societies today struggle with a lack of spiritual and moral direction. When people prioritize materialism, power, or self-interest over wisdom and righteousness, they risk falling into the same cycle of destruction that Hosea warned about.CLE, let\u2019s explore how this verse connects to other scriptures or historical events?Hosea 4:6 connects deeply with other scriptures and historical events that emphasize the importance of divine knowledge and the consequences of rejecting it.Biblical Connections1.- Proverbs 1:7 \u2013 \u201cThe fear of Jehovah is the beginning of knowledge; fools despise wisdom and discipline.\u201d This verse reinforces the idea that true knowledge comes from reverence for God. Hosea 4:6 warns of destruction due to a lack of knowledge, while Proverbs 1:7 highlights that wisdom begins with acknowledging God.2.- Deuteronomy 30:19-20 \u2013 This passage presents a choice between life and death, blessing and curse, based on obedience to God\u2019s commandments. Hosea 4:6 reflects the tragic consequences of Israel choosing rebellion over obedience.3.- Isaiah 5:13 \u2013 \u201cTherefore my people will go into exile for lack of knowledge; their nobles will die of hunger, and their masses will be parched with thirst.\u201d This verse mirrors Hosea\u2019s warning, showing that ignorance of God\u2019s law leads to suffering and exile.4.- Matthew 22:29 \u2013 Jesus tells the Pharisees, \u201cYou are mistaken, because you do not know the Scriptures or the power of God.\u201d This echoes Hosea 4:6, where ignorance of divine truth leads to rejection.Historical Connections1.- The Fall of Israel (722 BCE) \u2013 Hosea\u2019s prophecy was fulfilled when the Assyrians conquered the Northern Kingdom of Israel. The people had abandoned God\u2019s teachings, leading to their downfall.2.- The Babylonian Exile (586 BCE) \u2013 Similar to Hosea\u2019s warning, Judah\u2019s rejection of divine wisdom led to their captivity in Babylon.3.- The Reformation (16th Century) \u2013 The Protestant Reformation was driven by a desire to restore biblical knowledge to the people, challenging religious authorities who had withheld scriptural truths.Hosea 4:6 is a timeless warning that applies to both ancient and modern societies.

Yes, this is serious business, our salvation that Christ endured a torture stake for, because only those that endure to the end will survive! To endure we must not be like Esau, who sold his birthright for a bowl of soup! But we must be more like Jacob, Esau\u2019s brother! Whom respected the inheritance!The story of Esau and Jacob is a powerful lesson in endurance and valuing spiritual blessings. According to the Bible, Esau traded his birthright for a bowl of stew, showing a lack of appreciation for the inheritance and promises of God. This account is often used as a warning not to prioritize temporary satisfaction over lasting spiritual rewards.The principle of endurance is emphasized in scriptures such as Matthew 24:13, which states, \u201cBut the one who has endured to the end will be saved.\u201d Similarly, Hebrews 12:16-17 warns against being like Esau, who forfeited his blessing for immediate gratification.Reply Sorry Greg, yet your comment of the soup did ring a bell for me though, maybe holy spirit?

Much of it rings well true, for but one example the portion about the library idea, Thomas Jefferson is attributed the quote \u201cno nation can remain ignorant and free\u201d, and there is plenty of case law and published legal discourse concerning the nature of federalism. One example being the study which the Eisenhower administration conducted concerning Federal Jurisdiction within the several states. But, also, medical knowledge \u2013 by ignorance people have enabled bad actors to mete detrimental advice, prescription chemicals, etc. whereas most causes and cures for what ails people have been known for a very long time. The thing about democracy, as it\u2019s called, is that the ignorance of one\u2019s neighbor is to be more feared than any \u201cforeign\u201d invader, or as Goethe commented \u201cthere is nothing more frightful than ignorance in action. As it goes, one can lead horses to water but that\u2019s the extent of it, and in humankind\u2019s case it appears there is always a large percentage who are destined, for whatever reasons, to remain ignorant on important topics. Perhaps it is just not practical for eery-one to be well-studied, and there will always be an overclass, Proverbs 22:7.

Thanks! CLE05/10/2025 \u2022I\u2019ve been through quite a bit of traumatic experience, and at a point in the 90\u2019s realized that I survived and continue to exist only by the grace of the Grand Architect. So, when it came time to pay for \u201cmedical insurance\u201d, it seemed to be frivolous, to pay protection money to mere hooman beans, when the true protection comes from elsewhere. One personal conclusion is there are very few \u201cmedications\u201d which actually do any good. One case in point \u2013 schizophrenia was cured using niacin and proven without a doubt via a double-blind, placebo-controlled study in the late 50\u2019s by Abram Hoffer, MD. I pondered all the \u201ctreatments\u201d for that disease which are promoted for profit, and thought to myself \u201cself, why do so few know of Dr. Hoffer\u2019s work ?\u201d Instead, the persons are given \u201cmedications\u201d. And I personally concluded most of the \u201cmedications\u201d are a mis-direction, that the real answers can be found elsewhere than what is in the popular news.
