Every cereal box I\u2019ve ever seen has boasted about its nutritional ingredients, drilling into our brains that it is the healthiest option for breakfast in the morning. But even cereals that promote themselves as being a part of a healthy breakfast can be made up of more than 50% sugar by weight. And when you eat a massive amount of sugar the first thing in the day, it can spike your blood sugar. This will signal to your brain throughout the day that you need more sugar, leading to dips in energy levels and concentration\u2014not exactly what you want to get from the most important meal of the day. **Breakfast Cereal \u2013 The Biggest Con** Have you ever stopped to consider the ingredients lurking within these seemingly harmless boxes? Most people overlook the importance of examining the components of their daily cereal, unaware of the detrimental effects they may have on their health. Everything from the manufacturing process and toxic ingredients, to the unwanted additives Understand the truth behind the breakfast cereal industry and learn how to make informed choices for a healthier breakfast. **The Violent Manufacturing Process** The violent manufacturing process used for boxed cereal, known as extrusion, significantly impacts the nutritional value of the final product. Here are some key points to understand about the violent nature of the extrusion process: The grains are exposed to extreme temperatures, often reaching up to 400 degrees Fahrenheit, which destroys delicate nutrients such as vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants essential for our health. (source) The grains are subjected to intense pressure and shear forces as they pass through the extruder, breaking down the structure of the grains and altering their nutritional composition. (source) The extrusion process also destroys nutrients, natural enzymes, and beneficial bacteria in the grains, which play a crucial role in digestion, blood sugar regulation, and protection against chronic diseases. (source) In summary, the extrusion process used in the production of boxed cereals involves high temperatures, pressure, and mechanical forces that compromise the nutritional integrity of the grains. It leads to the destruction of essential nutrients and enzymes, while also facilitating the formation of potentially harmful compounds. Understanding the impact of this violent manufacturing process emphasizes the importance of seeking healthier breakfast alternatives that preserve the natural goodness of grains. **Toxic Ingredients & Additives** Breakfast cereals, particularly those marketed to children, are notorious for their excessive sugar content. Studies conducted by the Environmental Working Group (EWG) revealed thatchildren\u2019s cereals contain over 40 percent more sugar than those marketed to adults. **Glyphosate** Non-organic cereals often hide high fructose corn syrup under the ambiguous label of \u201csugar.\u201d Glyphosate, present in toxic pesticides, frequently finds its way into breakfast cereals through the cultivation of corn and other crops. Most store-bought cereal brands utilize sugar and corn derived from genetically modified organisms (GMOs). These GMO crops are often exposed to glyphosate, a known herbicide associated with cancer. Disturbingly, a 2019 study by the Environmental Working Group discovered alarming levels of Monsanto\u2019s glyphosate in our food. Independent research further links glyphosate exposure to various diseases, including dementia, cancer, and diabetes. **Artificial Food Dyes** Petroleum-based food dyes, such as Red 40, Yellow 5 & 6, and caramel color, pose significant health risks. These additives have been associated with hyperactivity, behavioral issues in children, allergic skin reactions, and even cancerous tumors in animal studies. **Hydrogenated Oils** Partially hydrogenated oils, often found in cereals, contain trans fats. Consumption of trans fats is linked to numerous health problems, including cancer, heart disease, and compromised immunity. **Harmful Preservatives** Butylated Hydroxytoluene (BHT), an endocrine disruptor, is a toxic preservative commonly used in cereals. Multiple studies on animals have shown a potential link between BHT and cancer. The FDA is currently reevaluating the safety of BHT in food products. Another problematic additive, BHA, has been identified as a potential human carcinogen by the National Institutes of Health\u2019s National Toxicology Programs. **Top Breakfast Cereal Brands to Avoid** **7 Surprising Cereals That Do Not Qualify as \u2018Healthy\u2019 Based On The FDA\u2019s new definition:** Raisin Bran (9g of added sugars) Honey Nut Cheerios (12g of added sugars) Corn Flakes (300mg of sodium; 4g of added sugars) Honey Bunches of Oats, Honey Roasted (8g of added sugars) Frosted Mini Wheats (12g of added sugars) Life (8g of added sugars) Special K (270mg of sodium; 4g of added sugars) **Other Unhealthy Cereals To Avoid:** Honey Smacks\u2013 One serving of this cereal may only be 110 calories, but there\u2019s a whopping 16 grams of sugar in it.

My research showed me that most of my favorite cereals I grew up eating don\u2019t exactly provide much nutritional value. Perhaps we should view these sugary cereals as more of an occasional treat, rather than a daily breakfast. There are certainly better, healthier ways to start your mornings. **Opting for Organic Breakfast Cereal Alternatives** When you choose to consume cereals, prioritizing organic options can help you steer clear of many of the health concerns associated with conventional brands. Organic cereal options are typically made with wholesome ingredients, devoid of toxic additives, and free from GMOs and harmful pesticides. **Make Your Own Healthy Cereal At Home:** Step 1: Choose Your Base Ingredients Start by selecting a variety of whole grains as the foundation of your cereal. Options include rolled oats, quinoa flakes, millet, buckwheat groats, or a combination of these. Whole grains provide fiber, essential minerals, and sustained energy. Step 2: Add Nutritious Nuts and Seeds Enhance the nutritional profile of your cereal by incorporating a mix of nuts and seeds. Consider almonds, walnuts, flaxseeds, chia seeds, sunflower seeds, or pumpkin seeds. These ingredients provide healthy fats, protein, and additional fiber. Step 3: Incorporate Dried Fruits For a touch of natural sweetness and added flavor, include dried fruits in your cereal mix. Options like raisins, cranberries, chopped dates, or dried apricots work well. Make sure to choose unsweetened varieties without any added sugars or preservatives. Step 4: Spice it Up Get creative with spices and flavorings to enhance the taste of your homemade cereal. Consider adding cinnamon, nutmeg, vanilla extract, or a sprinkle of cocoa powder. These spices add depth and warmth to your cereal without the need for excess sugar. Step 5: Mix and Store In a large mixing bowl, combine all your chosen ingredients in the desired proportions. Stir well to ensure an even distribution of flavors. Once thoroughly mixed, transfer your homemade cereal to an airtight container for storage. Step 6: Serve and Enjoy When you\u2019re ready to enjoy your homemade cereal, simply portion out the desired amount into a bowl. You can enjoy it with your choice of milk, whether it\u2019s dairy, almond, soy, or any other plant-based milk. You can also add fresh fruits or yogurt for added texture and nutrition. Step 7: Experiment and Customize Don\u2019t be afraid to experiment with different ingredient combinations to suit your taste preferences. You can vary the types of grains, nuts, seeds, and fruits to create a new flavor profile each time you make your cereal. Feel free to get creative and add additional ingredients like coconut flakes, cacao nibs, or even a touch of natural sweeteners like honey or maple syrup if desired. By making your own cereal at home, you have full control over the quality of ingredients and can enjoy a wholesome, nutritious, and personalized breakfast option. Say goodbye to unhealthy store-bought cereals and start your day on a healthier note with your very own homemade cereal creation. **Michelle Toole** **Related Articles** **Puberty Before Age 10: A New \u2018Normal\u2019?** **5 easy exercises you had no idea could burn fat as effectively as running** **Poor Sleep is a Huge Source of Pain!
