No boring slideshows with someone talking into a cheap webcam! Many scenes are shot on location for a class with more of an in-person feel, where your teacher is talking to a small room of students to explain concepts before getting into demonstrations. Courses are broken into lessons (eg. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDehydration\u00e2\u0080\u009d) and their topics (eg. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSymptoms\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009cTreatment\u00e2\u0080\u009d). You move through at your own pace and in whatever order you want. Most topics have a main video with additional pictures and text beneath. Who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s this for? Total head-in-the-sand beginners, weekend warriors, all the way through experienced preppers advancing their skills. For example, the knife sharpening course isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t going to make you a professional bladesmith, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll get you close! But I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not a prepper Are you a responsible adult? Gone are the days when most preppers fit into stereotypes. All that matters is you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re aware enough to know life can be hard and smart enough to do something about it. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll join a diverse community of kind, like-minded people. Are online courses right for me? We won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t offer online courses unless we think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just as good as an equivalent in-person weekend course. Some are even better than a week-long 24/7 course. You might want to take an online course so you can warm up at your own pace before your limited and expensive in-person time. Maybe you want to try the cheaper online version first before deciding if you want to go to a more advanced physical course. Or maybe you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve taken an in-person course and want the digital version as a refresher you can go back to over the years. This course is for everyone! How much / what will I learn? Prepping can be overwhelming in general\u00e2\u0080\u0094and you shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to dive into the deep end of a topic just to learn the basics. We focus on Pareto Preparedness, based on the 80-20 \u00e2\u0080\u009cPareto rule,\u00e2\u0080\u009d so you get the right info you need and none of what you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. That way you can get back to enjoying real life \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 just a lot smarter! Once you finish a course, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll know enough to get you through the vast majority of emergency scenarios you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll face and you'll be better prepared than 99% of people around you. How long do I have access? What about updates? Lifetime access, including free, automatic upgrades for anything we add or change in the future to that course. What emergencies do you cover? Modern, sane prepping means focusing first on things that are more likely than a doomsday scenario. Prepping is about being prepared for anything that could majorly disrupt your life, which might be as simple as a car accident or sudden job loss. Natural disasters are another biggie.These courses are meant to apply to normal life as much as possible, but they also explain what to do in the really bad scenarios. Can I get my money back? Sure! If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not happy, just let us know within a month and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll get a full refund. 2023 The Prepared.
