Because of this extraordinary amount of work, joint concerns are widespread, and easy to see why joint complaints increase with age. Understanding the root cause behind joint aches and stiffness is essential for understanding why you are experiencing joint discomfort and how you can alleviate it naturally without prescriptions.\u201d\u2013 Dr. Edward Group, DC In this comprehensive article, we will explore the root cause behind joint pain and the symptoms it manifests. As a bonus, I\u2019ll share invaluable tips and tricks to alleviate joint pain naturally, offering you a pathway to relief without relying on prescriptions. Let\u2019s embark on this journey to reclaim optimal joint health together. An Overview of Your Joints Your joints are responsible for ensuring the bones of your skeleton can move. They are located where the bones in your body connect. While there are between 250 and 350 joints in the human body, a few of the most well-known and those most likely to suffer from aches and other issues are the following: Hips Hips Hips Knees Knees Knees Shoulders Shoulders Shoulders Elbows Elbows Elbows Wrists Wrists Wrists Discomfort in these joints results in aching, stiffness, and soreness that can make it hurtful to move or enjoy the things you love, such as playing tennis, going for a jog, doing yoga, knitting, and more. What\u2019s Behind Your Joint Discomfort? The real question we should always ask is, What is the root cause of the discomfort in your joints? Let\u2019s talk about the answer, which might be simpler than you think. The number one cause of joint concerns is wear and tear, which simply means that joint discomfort is most often the result of long-term use that wears away the cartilage\u2014or protective cushion\u2014between your joints. When this happens, the spacing between your bones shrinks, and more stress is placed on the rest of the soft tissues in your joints. Your joints then become stiff, and your discomfort can increase over time. Previous joint injuries can also accelerate this process, making joint issues more likely. Overuse, whether through repetitive stress, such as typing or through physical activities, is also a factor in the process. Joints can also suffer due to underlying conditions that continually irritate the joint structures. Symptoms of Wear and Tear Joint Concerns Because wear and tear is the most common factor involved in joint issues, let\u2019s pause and focus on the symptoms you may experience from this concern. Common symptoms involved in wear and tear joint concerns include: Discomfort\u2013 Discomfort of joints during or after movement can indicate wear and tear issues.

It\u2019s important to note that these issues can simultaneously affect single or multiple joints. **Tips to Prevent and Soothe Joint Discomfort** The good news is that while it\u2019s not possible to reverse the wear and tear that could be causing your joint discomfort, you can find relief using some simple tips and tricks. **#1 \u2013 Non-Toxic Vitamins and Supplements** Specific vitamins and supplements have been shown to help reduce joint discomfort and may even prevent it from worsening. However, not all vitamins and supplements are the same, so be careful when choosing yours. Ones to try include: Omega-3 Fatty Acids\u2014Because omega-3s support balanced inflammation, they have been used in studies for joint health. In fact, these studies have shown that when people take fish oil supplements (rich in Omega-3s), they suffer from less joint discomfort and stiffness and less morning stiffness1.

Turmeric/Curcumin\u2014Turmeric and its main component, curcumin, also offer potent support for helping maintain inflammatory levels in the normal range.

Vitamin D\u2014Essential for bone health, adequate vitamin D levels are important for overall joint function. Additionally, vitamin D is mood-supportive and helps reduce the stress that often goes hand in hand with joint issues.

Calcium\u2014While primarily associated with bone health, calcium also plays an important role in muscle function and may contribute to overall musculoskeletal health. Just be sure to look for one that offers an optimal 2:1 calcium-to-magnesium balance.

Exercise\u2014Regular, low-impact exercise is essential. Whether you\u2019re an aging athlete, trying to stay in shape, or simply want to avoid joint and muscle pain, yoga, walking, rebounding, and hiking are excellent for supporting joint and muscle recovery. These activities increase flexibility and mobility while promoting blood flow and circulation, which can accelerate healing.Weight loss:One out of every three U.S. adults is considered obese (Harvard, 2020). Losing weight can tremendously help your joints. For every extra pound you carry, your joints experience an added strain. This is especially true of the weight-bearing joints of your hips and knees.Keep Your Body Hydrated \u2013When you don\u2019t supply your body with enough clean water for hydration, the thickness of your synovial fluid declines. Your joints are then likely to grind against each other and pain and discomfort. That\u2019s why when people with arthritis become dehydrated, their joint conditions, like arthritis, often worsen. And, hydration is vital for flushing toxins out of your body, which can help fight inflammation. I suggest drinking 80% distilled water and 20% Spring water.Beyond water, incorporate nourishing hydration options like organic smoothies and healthy beverages infused with lemon or apple cider vinegar to effectively hydrate your body. Embracing low-glycemic organic vegetables further enhances hydration levels. In particular, organic Lemon or lime juice serves as a potent hydrating agent, boasting a rich array of vitamin C, citrus bioflavonoids, and essential electrolytes like potassium and magnesium. Other lifestyle choices that support healthy joints include: Maintaining a very healthy plant-based diet and weight. Practicing good posture\u2014especially if you spend a lot of time in front of a computer. Stretching before and after exercise. When combined, all of the above lifestyle changes can provide very positive results for your joints. **#3 \u2013 Put Topical Preparations to Work for Your Joints** Finally, a highly effective way to relieve the aches and stiffness plaguing your joints is to apply potent topical oils. While not all topicals are created equal, a number are known for their ability to provide targeted relief for joint discomfort. When possible, purchase the purest organic and unrefined oils. Coconut oil, for instance, offers an excellent natural solution for joint issues. Like the omega-3s from fish oil that we talked about above, coconut oil is packed with healthy fats that help support normal inflammatory levels. Similarly, jojoba oil provides a natural source of moisture and nourishes joint tissue with its rich vitamins and minerals, which can help relieve joint discomfort. Another potent joint reliever, arnica oil, is known to be rich in sesquiterpene lactone, which like coconut oil, can help maintain inflammatory levels in the normal range from reduced discomfort. Camphor can also be used to reduce discomfort due to joint wear and tear. Its dual cooling and warming sensation eases joint issues on contact. The oil is easy to apply, readily absorbed into the skin, and doesn\u2019t leave any greasy residue on clothes. Other oils that can be applied topically for joint ache and stiffness relief include: Eucalyptus oil\u2014This oil not only offers a relaxing effect to combat the stress and tension of joint concerns, but it also supports healthy, happy joints. Juniper oil\u2013 Powerful against soreness, juniper helps support healthy joint tissues and relieves irritation. Peppermint oil\u2014With its cooling sensation, peppermint oil provides relief for sore muscles and joints on contact, as its aromatherapy benefits go to work to ease tension and calm stress. Wintergreen oil\u2014Rich in methyl salicylate, this oil is a key ingredient in supporting healthy inflammation levels in the normal range and easing irritation and tension. The best thing about these oils is since they are applied topically, you can get right to the source of your hurt and discomfort, so that you can start feeling better faster. **In Closing** While joint discomfort can stem from various factors, wear and tear stand out as the primary root cause of joint pain. The good news? By implementing simple yet effective strategies at home, such as committing to regular exercise, adopting lifestyle modifications, and harnessing the potential of topical solutions, you can experience tangible and enduring relief from joint issues. What\u2019s more, these proactive measures hold the promise of averting future concerns, paving the way for sustained joint health and vitality. **If Cancer Scares You, Do Not Miss This...** [link_aff href=\"https://go.thetruthaboutcancer.com/\" target=\"_blank\" a_aid=\"54fd974f499c5\"]See the Truth About Cancer\u00ae here.[/link_aff] Over 20,000 people die each day from cancer.
