Nunes WASHINGTON\u2013Women in the military are warfighters, patriots, leaders and dedicated members of the community who, if they meet the standard, deserve the opportunity to serve their country, with no exceptions. The Army\u2019s 250thbirthday celebration is an appropriate time to reflect on the honor and value of military service, and to also honor those who serve. But the June 14thobservance in Washington, D.C. has become another offering to Donald Trump\u2019s ego. He sees the parade of 70, one-ton tanks, thousands of soldiers and more than 100 other vehicles not as a celebration of military service, but of service and loyalty to himself. We choose to march on a different path. We celebrate women in the military by recalling their achievements, their victories and their leadership. And we rally with them as they stand up for their right to serve, with all the respect and support they so richly deserve. Last year was the first time in several years that the Army achieved its goals for recruitment\u2014mainly due to an increase in female recruits, according to data reviewed byMilitary.com. There was an 18 percent jump in the number of women signing up for active duty in 2024 over the previous year, while male recruitment rose by just eight percent. We need women in the military\u2014the numbers prove it. But Trump\u2019s executive orders and defense funding bill are bringing harmful and divisive policies that would hurt women, threaten military readiness and endanger the health and security of military families. It seems like Trump wants less women, not more. On day one of his second term, Admiral Linda Fagan, the first female to lead the Coast Guard, was fired for reasons including an excessive focus on diversity issues. Since then, the firings have stepped up to include: Vice Admiral Shoshana Chatfield, the U.S. Representative to NATO\u2019s military committee; Lt. Gen. Jennifer Short, the first female Senior Military Assistant to the Secretary of Defense; and Lisa Franchetti, the first female Chief of Naval Operations; leaving the military without a single woman in a four-star general or admiral leadership position. Woman servicemembers make up nearly 20% of the total military, and are vital to our nation\u2019s defense, and to the strength of communities where military families live. Surveys of active-duty troops have shown that men who serve alongside womensupport a gender-integrated military, and even the Marine Corps has begun graduating mixed-gender battalions. Representation of women in the military has increased to 17 percent, a far cry from the 2 percent representation in 1970. We should be using this Army birthday celebration to ensure that our nation\u2019s military remains strong by recruiting\u2014and supporting\u2014more women. It\u2019s not news that Donald Trump disrespects women\u2014but his callous disregard for women in the military, their service and their accomplishments are even more odious than usual. Our military has long been a place where women could rise and be judged on merit. That\u2019s a bedrock value that we must all now defend.
