Photo:AP As much of the world\u2019s attention is focused on Israel\u2019s horrific genocide in Gaza, Israel is also escalating its multi-pronged campaign of terror, forced displacement and ethnic cleansing in the occupied Palestinian West Bank. This is coupled with a violent expansion of illegal Israeli settlements right on Palestinian-owned land. The West Bank is the area of historic Palestine west of the Jordan River (on the east side of what is now Israel). It is home to nearly three million Palestinians and has been mandated by the United Nations to be part of a future Palestinian state. Yet it has been under military occupation by Israel since it was seized by Israel through war in 1967. It is a basic principle of international law that a country that is occupying a territory cannot just take it over and make it part of its country. But since 1967, Israel\u2014with U.S. backing\u2014has violated international law and flooded the West Bank with illegal settlements and 500,000 settlers. These settlements are vehicles for Israel\u2019s theft of what, according to international law, is Palestinian land, and to carve it up, forcing Palestinians into small areas surrounded by Israeli military and hemmed in with \u201ccheckpoints.\u201d At the same time, the Palestinian population is subjected to continuous terror by mobs of heavily armed, rabidly racist \u201csettlers,\u201d who rampage across the West Bank terrorizing and brutalizing unarmed Palestinian farmers with impunity. Here are some of the main Israeli assaults on Palestinians in the West Bank in recent months: Israel\u2019s New Settlement Expansion\u2014Huge Step Toward Annexation.On May 29, theIsraeli government announcedit was planning to create 22 new settlements in the West Bank\u2014the biggest expansion in decades.1Also, on June 3,Bezalel Smotrich, Israel\u2019s pro-genocide Finance Minister, announced that the government would move ahead with construction plans, including 15,000 new housing units, that will \u201ceffectively divide the territory's northern and southern regions,\u201dHaaretz reports. \u201cThis is how you kill the Palestinian state\u2026 This is how you bring in a million residents,\u201d he said. \u201cGod willing, there'll be [Israeli] sovereignty [i.e., annexation of the West Bank] during this term.\u201d West Bank Land Registration: Enabling Palestinian Dispossession.For the first time since Israel occupied the West Bank in 1967,the government has decidedto implement land registration. This is a step toward annexation in that Israelis will be able to claim permanent legal ownership of land while Palestinians, for all practical purposes, will not. This decision violates the prohibition against occupying powers making long-term changes in occupied territory, according to an international human rights lawyer. \u201cThere's no chance that any Palestinian will have their rights recognized,\" he said, adding that the decision will lead to \"a massive land grab by Israel of all lands in Area C.\" (A part of the West Bank administered by Israel.) Israeli Displaces Tens of Thousands\u2014\u201cHuge, Under-the-Radar Shift.\u201dIsrael has forced tens of thousands of Palestinians from their homes in the last several months. \u201cSome Palestinians fear it may be laying the ground to annex the territory,\u201dtheNew York Timesreports, calling it a \u201cHuge, Under-the-Radar Shift\u201d in the West Bank. Jenin is one of the towns targeted. One densely populated Jenin neighborhood where \u201cmore than 10,000 people lived until recently,\" now \"is empty\u2014its roads blocked by mounds of dirt and flanked by piles of rubble.\u201d So far some 40,000 Palestinians have been displaced, more than any other Israeli military operation since Israel captured the territory during the 1967 Middle East war.

Palestinians in the West Bank with posters of friends and relatives taken prisoner by Israeli forces. Photo:AP The Deadliest Period for Palestinian Prisoners in Israeli Detention. After October 7, 2023, the abuse of prisoners has gravely worsened, with at least 70 deaths, and a \u201cdramatic escalationin the number of Palestinians behind bars\u201d\u2014more than 10,100, nearly double the number from before October 7\u2014as well as \u201cincreasing prisoner abuse and mistreatment by Israeli authorities.\u201d Most Settler Attacks in Over Two Decades.There are now more Israeli settler attacks on Palestinian communities in the West Bank than any other time in at least two decades, with an average of 44 Palestinians injured each month by settler attacks.2 Jerusalem Day Flag March: Mass Pogrom (Race Riot) Against Palestinians.May 26.This annual, government-sponsored commemoration ofIsrael's seizure of East Jerusalem in 1967,features tens of thousandsof fanatical youths from the religious Zionist movement rampaging through the streets of Jerusalem\u2019s Old City, attacking Palestinians, \u201cstealing merchandise, smashing shop signs, beating on metal doors with flagpoles, plastering racist stickers by the hundreds, and more.\u201dIn addition to \u201cDeath to Arabs\u201d chants, this year these rabid Zionist youths celebrated the genocide in Gaza: \"There's no school in Gaza, there's no children left,\" \"Let the IDF fuck the Arabs,\" and \"Flatten Gaza.\" One Haaretz writer summed up, \u201cContrary to claims from religious-nationalist leaders, this hate is not the work of a small fringe\u2026 It wasn't a fringe few singing the racist songs, it was the majority.\u201d Adding, \u201cThere is a straight line that connects the crude racism, violence, and cruelty unleashed every Jerusalem Day with the horrors unfolding in Gaza.\u201d Jerusalem Day Flag March: Mass Pogrom (Race Riot) Against Palestinians.May 26.This annual, government-sponsored commemoration ofIsrael's seizure of East Jerusalem in 1967,features tens of thousandsof fanatical youths from the religious Zionist movement rampaging through the streets of Jerusalem\u2019s Old City, attacking Palestinians, \u201cstealing merchandise, smashing shop signs, beating on metal doors with flagpoles, plastering racist stickers by the hundreds, and more.\u201d In addition to \u201cDeath to Arabs\u201d chants, this year these rabid Zionist youths celebrated the genocide in Gaza: \"There's no school in Gaza, there's no children left,\" \"Let the IDF fuck the Arabs,\" and \"Flatten Gaza.\" One Haaretz writer summed up, \u201cContrary to claims from religious-nationalist leaders, this hate is not the work of a small fringe\u2026 It wasn't a fringe few singing the racist songs, it was the majority.\u201d Adding, \u201cThere is a straight line that connects the crude racism, violence, and cruelty unleashed every Jerusalem Day with the horrors unfolding in Gaza.\u201d Jerusalem Day Flag March: Mass Pogrom (Race Riot) Against Palestinians.May 26.This annual, government-sponsored commemoration ofIsrael's seizure of East Jerusalem in 1967,features tens of thousandsof fanatical youths from the religious Zionist movement rampaging through the streets of Jerusalem\u2019s Old City, attacking Palestinians, \u201cstealing merchandise, smashing shop signs, beating on metal doors with flagpoles, plastering racist stickers by the hundreds, and more.\u201d In addition to \u201cDeath to Arabs\u201d chants, this year these rabid Zionist youths celebrated the genocide in Gaza: \"There's no school in Gaza, there's no children left,\" \"Let the IDF fuck the Arabs,\" and \"Flatten Gaza.\" One Haaretz writer summed up, \u201cContrary to claims from religious-nationalist leaders, this hate is not the work of a small fringe\u2026 It wasn't a fringe few singing the racist songs, it was the majority.\u201d Adding, \u201cThere is a straight line that connects the crude racism, violence, and cruelty unleashed every Jerusalem Day with the horrors unfolding in Gaza.\u201d Israel Shuts Six UNRWA Schools Sending Hundreds of Students Home.UNRWA, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees, was formed in 1948 to address the basic needs of the Palestinian people, including for food, shelter, education, and other basic necessities.The May 8 order carried out by Israeli security forces, forced some 700 students in East Jerusalem to leave school and go home. Israel has prohibited UNRWA\u2019s activities in Israel, and this is yet another escalation of its campaign to destroy the organization which provides vital humanitarian support and services to Palestinians. Israeli Military Fires on Foreign Diplomats.On May 21, a diplomatic delegation from the European Union came under Israeli fire (\u201cwarning shots\u201d) as it was conducting an official investigation of the humanitarian situation in the besieged Jenin refugee camp, which has been under violent Israeli attack. Israel Launches Public Relations Campaign to Legitimize Illegal West Bank Settlements.On May 7,Israel's Diaspora Ministry announcedthe launch of a nearly $1 million global public relations campaign to \"bolster the legitimization of settlements\" in the international arena. Trump Regime Shuts Down Direct Communications with Palestinians.\u201cThe U.S. ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, plans to shut down a direct communications channel between U.S. diplomats in Jerusalem working on Palestinian issues and agencies in Washington,\u201dthe New York Times reports. This is a big signal that under Trump, the U.S. no longer considers Palestinian issues as important, or that the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip are separate from Israel. In short, it\u2019s a step in the direction of Israeli annexation. *** These illegal Israeli assaults represent a serious and deadly leap. As in Gaza, these crimes are being accelerated thanks to the big green light from the Trump/MAGA fascist regime. Hamas' October 7, 2023 attack on Israel was launched from Gaza, not the West Bank. Yet the people of the West Bank too are being imprisoned, tortured, terrorized, murdered and their land is being taken anyway. This is further irrefutable proof that Israel isn\u2019t \u201cdefending itself against terrorism\u201d\u2014it\u2019s seizing this moment to carry out an all-around genocide of the Palestinian people.
