Shocked to discover how warning signs were missed at his school, she started a Change.org petition calling for stronger school bullying policies in her home state of Indiana. The petition quickly gained nearly 100,000 signatures, drawing the attention of lawmakers and leading to an invitation to speak at the Indiana State House, where her testimony helped push forward a bill that will change the lives of kids across the state. \u201cI never thought I\u2019d be standing here, fighting for a law in my son\u2019s name. But if it stops just one family from feeling this pain, it\u2019s worth it.\u201d The bill requires schools to investigate bullying claims and inform parents, a step Becky believes could spare other families from the same grief. For her, the petition wasn\u2019t just about policy\u2014it was about accountability and action. She hopes others see that even without political experience or a platform, persistence can lead to real change. **Every successful petition starts with someone like you** Deutsch English (Australia) English (Canada) English (India) English (United Kingdom) English (United States) Espa\u00f1ol (Argentina) Espa\u00f1ol (Espa\u00f1a) Espa\u00f1ol (Latinoam\u00e9rica) Fran\u00e7ais \u0939\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0926\u0940 Bahasa Indonesia Italiano \u65e5\u672c\u8a9e Portugu\u00eas (Brasil) \u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0e20\u0e32\u0e29\u0e32\u0e44\u0e17\u0e22 T\u00fcrk\u00e7e"}
