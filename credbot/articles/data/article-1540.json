Last year the Environmental Health Coalition received a $20 million grant from the Environmental Protection Agency to improve air quality, build green spaces and add electric transit to some of San Diego\u2019s most polluted neighborhoods. Organizers were excited to get the award, which supplemented state funds for projects in Barrio Logan, National City and other communities exposed to pollution from truck traffic and industrial pollution. Everything went as expected on the start date Jan. 6, but by Jan. 28 the payment system for the grant was frozen after President Donald Trump cancelled climate action funding. Sacramento ReportHow lawmakers are tackling San Diego issues at the state Capitol.\u200b Browse all newsletters atvosd.org/newsletters \u201cWe are incurring costs, but we are unable to tap into the funds that are contractually obligated to us,\u201d Amy Casta\u00f1eda, policy co-director for the coalition, told me. \u201cWe continue to spend money with no hope that the funds will be reinstated.\u201d Attacks on climate action:San Diego organizations are grappling with Trump\u2019s plans to claw back federal climate funding and attack state greenhouse gas reduction laws, in a blitz that leaves local climate goals in doubt. With San Diego cities already falling behind on their targets, however, it might also provide cover for those shortfalls. On Jan. 20, Trump signed an ordercancelling federal fundingfor climate programs and compelling production of oil, gas, coal, nuclear and other energy sources. Then hesigned anotherthis week that takes aim at state climate programs, includingCalifornia\u2019s cap and trade, the state\u2019s market for reducing greenhouse gases. Legal experts say the attempt to kill state climate laws is an overreach that\u2019s likely to fail. California\u2019s cap-and-trade program creates a market that limits overall greenhouse emissions, but lets companies buy and sell carbon credits. The state uses that money to pay for renewable energy, alternative fuel transportation and other projects. Carbon credit auctions have brought in $28.3 billion to the state Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund since the program started in 2012, according to theCalifornia Air Resources Board.Nicole Capretz, CEO of Climate Action Campaign, said this is Trump\u2019s second stab at ending the program. \u201cHe already tried to dismantle California\u2019s cap and trade and he was unsuccessful,\u201d in his first term, she told me. \u201cI think California is feeling pretty secure in their cap-and-trade law. It is a massive revenue generator for the state and funds a whole suite of programs.\u201d But reversing funding approved during the Biden administration is trickier. Trump\u2019s day one order calls for \u201cterminating the Green New Deal\u201d by halting grants for electric vehicle charging stations and other infrastructure authorized in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act and the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. It\u2019s been an ordeal for the Environmental Health Coalition, which has struggled to access money, plan projects, manage staffing and even communicate with the EPA. For a few weeks in February and early March the funding was restored, Casta\u00f1eda said. Then it shut off again. The EPA project manager for the grant has cancelled every monthly check-in. \u201cWe\u2019re doing the work but have zero communication and we\u2019re in limbo now,\u201d Casta\u00f1eda told me. The coalition has contacted local lawmakers and is asking state officials to backfill the missing money with funds from Proposition 4, the $10 billion state climate bond measure that passed in November. If the coalition can\u2019t get grant funding restored, they\u2019ll have to look at staff cuts, Casta\u00f1eda said. \u201cWe\u2019re considering layoffs, we\u2019re considering furloughs and staff time reductions, because we cannot sustain that big a hit,\u201d she said. Local governments and advocacy groups have challenged Trump\u2019s authority to cancel spending Congress authorized, arguing that only Congress \u2013 not the president \u2013 has the power of the purse. Those cases are making their way through the courts, but in the meantime, Trump is slashing staff and funding at federal agencies. \u201cThis is more of a bullying tactic than anything else, meant to silence, to intimidate, to chill any new actions on climate,\u201d Capretz said. What does this mean for public climate action programs in San Diego?Those include the city\u2019sClimate Action Plan, the county\u2019sRegional Decarbonization Framework, which lays out countywide choices for transitioning from fossil fuels to renewable energy, and many other municipal climate action plans. I called San Diego County Board Chair Terra Lawson-Remer, who has been leading the county\u2019s climate action efforts. Her office said she didn\u2019t have any comment; things are moving too fast and she\u2019s waiting to see how it shakes out. Environmental leaders say the cuts could throw a monkey wrench in local efforts to slash greenhouse gas emissions, which are already behind schedule. The Climate Action Coalition\u2019sannual report cardgrades the county\u2019s nine biggest cities on their climate progress. It gave mixed reviews last year. The report card urged cities to set annual benchmarks for greenhouse gas reductions and noted that California needs to triple its rate of greenhouse gas cuts to effectively fight climate change. San Diego has done a good job promoting renewable energy through community choice programs that offer a greener portfolio of energy sources than utility companies, Capretz said. But it\u2019s behind the curve on electrifying buildings, switching to electric vehicles and cutting the amount that people drive. Could the Trump onslaught offer cover for cities to let their climate plans slide? Maybe, Capretz said. \u201cIt would be an excuse not to take action because of the threat by the federal government, or it could dampen political will,\u201d she said. But she thinks California\u2019s vast size and economic clout give us options. \u201cCalifornia is going to have to invest more into climate solutions and backfill what the federal government will say it won\u2019t fund,\u201d she said. \u201cWe should have more ballot measures and redirect more funding so we don\u2019t slow down progress. If you\u2019re the fifth largest economy in the world you can act independently.\u201d **How are Education Cuts Landing in San Diego?** Our education reporter Jackob McWhinney and investigative reporter Will Huntsberry attended a San Diego event withEducation Secretary Linda McMahon, who insisted that the elimination of the federal Department of Education means cuts to bureaucracy, not school funding. Last week, McWhinney wrote thatUCSD could lose hundreds of millions of dollarsfrom Trump cuts to higher education. The administration is slashing research grants for clinical trials on HIV and AIDS, and studies on how domestic violence affects pregnant women. That\u2019s on top of the state\u2019s plans to cut 8 percent across the UC system. All told, UC San Diego could lose half a billion dollars, UCSD Chancellor Pradeep Khosla warned.
