Trump has resisted orders fromfederal judgesto restore clean energy funds, and he will most likely enact new limits once the freeze officiallyexpires. But corporations and investors with positions in clean power claim to be unconcerned. Multinationals building wind turbines in the US insist that Trump hasno impacton their business, and that electrification is inevitable. Some analysts claim similarly that despite Trump\u2019s rollback of IRA tax credits for renewables, recent wind and solar projects areunstoppablebecause of theircost-competitiveness. This optimistic picture is misleading because it relies on confusion about the kinds of renewable projects we\u2019re talking about. Trump\u2019s executive order is uniquely harmful to renewable projects initiated by state governments and nonprofits. Under the IRA, nonprofits could receive funding through clean energy tax credits converted into grants. This method of\u201cdirect pay\u201dhelped nonprofits finance renewable power through tax credits that would otherwise be unhelpful (because nonprofits are tax-exempt). Cities, tribes, schools, hospitals, and public utilities had already initiated solar projects with the expectation of receiving tens of millions in reimbursements from direct pay. States like Michigan, Nebraska, and Minnesota have committed to 100% clean energy, and partnerships with institutions eligible for direct pay arenecessary to meet those targets. Some have argued that Trump cannot rollback IRA tax credits because they were enacted by Congress. Yet Trump\u2019s order to\u201cimmediately pause the disbursement of funds\u201dfrom the IRA, including for EV infrastructure, guts the direct pay system and leaves corporations relatively unscathed. Public and nonprofit clean energy initiatives are most at risk because even a temporary pause in funding threatens the survival of those programs. Trump\u2019s freeze on IRA grants has directly threatened several projects, not only for wind and solar but also for related climate goals: The $7 billionSolar for Allprogram, which supported states and nonprofits installing solar panels in low-income neighborhoods Environmental justice programs by nonprofits tosupport disaster recovery,monitor emissions, andexpand community solarin neighborhoods of color $1 billion inUSDA grantsto assist rural businesses and farms with transitioning to wind and solar, and upgrades for energy efficiency $400 million forbattery storage and rooftop solarin Harris County, TX, the largest county in the state (Houston is its seat) Programs of the Nevada Clean Energy Fund, anonprofit green bankcreated by state government, to expand clean energy to disadvantaged communities including tribes IRA-funded programs in Pennsylvania toreduce emissions from factories, andplug oil and gas wellsto stop methane leaks. While not a renewables program, grants for mitigation ensure that fossil fuels don\u2019t offset the benefits of clean power. Some IRA funds were just partially un-frozen, such as forelectric school buses. But there will not be a back-to-normal scenario where innovative renewable projects become immune to Trump. He will continue to push the limits of executive power, and enlist Republicans in Congress, to limit the clean power projects of states and nonprofits. Grant-funded programs by states and nonprofits ensure that increases inrenewable power generation capacitycan be accessible to all communities, and achieve nationwide emissions reductions. Private sector renewables projects do not need to be expressly climate-focused to attract investors. In fact, corporations like CleanCapital (a solar and storage-focused company) have tried appealing to Trump by presenting themselves as job creators interested in\u201cenergy dominance.\u201dThe CEO of Montana Renewables (a subsidiary of manufacturing company Calumet)declared, \u201cWe don\u2019t have to say climate change.\u201d This is not a sign that renewables companies are being smart, but rather that they\u2019re putting profit first, and climate action second. Leaving the energy mix up to the short-term decisions of companies leads tocoordination problemsthat could be solved by green subsidies. The IRA grants for states and nonprofits are not traditional subsidies, but they might change companies\u2019 expectations of consumer demand, as well as state and local support for transmission infrastructure down the road. Trump has significantly limited the federal government\u2019s ability to throw its weight behind renewables, and thereby convince fossil fuel companies to adjust their investment decisions. While projects like \u201cSolar for All\u201d and nonprofit \u201cgreen banks\u201d don\u2019t appear to be market movers, these state/nonprofit projects could have spurred larger interventions. Renewables companies will undoubtedly reduce emissions just by providing their services, regardless of their intentions. But there is no free-market incentive for clean energy companies to try to replace fossil fuels. If they achieve sufficient returns on investment while coexisting with fossil fuels, they will happily cater to Trump\u2019s visions of \u201cenergy dominance.\u201d \u201cEnergy dominance\u201d under Trump gives us no path to net-zero by 2050, and supposedly unstoppable market trends can\u2019t get us there either. The near future of scattered renewables projects is akin to letting companies build roads without an ounce of urban planning to map things out. Renewables must be treated like civil infrastructure and receive the coordination and funding we expect in that sector. Multinationals like Siemens may continue to build turbines, but these investments will never result in net-zero absent substantial funding and planning outside the private sector. The projects most essential to long-term emissions reductions are not fromprivate equityor corporations acting alone. The outlook that \u201crenewables will survive Trump\u201d is incomplete because it only looks at clean energy from an investment angle, and not as an issue of infrastructure.
