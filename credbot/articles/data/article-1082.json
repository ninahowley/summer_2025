Tirado, co-pilot in the dark-olive-drab UH-60 Black Hawk, quickly worked out his new flight direction and his helicopter thwack-thwacked its way back into the hot sky, heading due north. ADVERTISEMENT It was just about 1 p.m. on April 23, 1983. A Saturday. Tirado, a pilot for U.S. Customs, hunted for drugs and drug smugglers. Drug interdiction, it was called. His helicopter was new to the Customs arsenal, on loan from the Army, part of President Ronald Reagan\u2019s new South Florida drug task force. Every day, Customs was sending up pilots like Tirado to patrol the sky off the east coast of Florida, north and south of Miami, scanning for suspicious airplanes. Today, a fellow Customs aircraft was tailing a suspect plane just east of Florida, over The Bahamas \u2014 an archipelago nation of some 700 islands. Tirado\u2019s Black Hawk could cruise at about 175 mph, faster if needed, so it quickly closed the distance to the radioed-in coordinates. Tally ho. There they were. ADVERTISEMENT Tirado could see the fast, twin-engine Customs pursuit plane following a smaller, single-engine, high-wing Cessna 210, glinting in the distance, its light skin striped with blue. Its tail number was N6608C, or as a pilot would identify it over the radio using the phonetic alphabet: \"6608 Charlie.\" Tirado fell in behind them\u2014close but not too close. The Customs pilots' job was to tail the Cessna, keep it under observation, see what it would do next. The Cessna was heading north-northwest, in the general direction of Grand Bahama Island, flying steady and true. It was entirely possible its pilot wasn\u2019t aware he was being tailed. Tirado watched as the Cessna turned then, curving west toward Florida, visible on the horizon. Interesting. Very interesting. The two Customs aircraft trailed behind the Cessna as it cruised in the sky about the Atlantic Ocean, toward the U.S. coast, about 150 miles away. ADVERTISEMENT The miles melted away under the hot sun. The Cessna could potentially outrace Tirado\u2019s Black Hawk, but if the pilot decided to run, it would be difficult to outrun the speedy and radar-equipped Customs plane. Then again, sometimes smugglers in these small planes would try to evade authorities by shaking them off, flying so slow it would force faster pursuit aircraft to overfly them and circle back, opening chances to escape. That\u2019s where Tirado\u2019s helicopter might come in handy\u2014it could fly as slowly as needed. As Florida grew larger in Tirado\u2019s windshield, another Customs twin-engine aircraft came into view. This was pilot James McCawley. McCawley had taken off from Florida and now joined the chase just off-shore, pulling in behind Tirado\u2019s Black Hawk\u2014a three-aircraft Customs air force strung out behind a small Cessna. Landfall. Florida. The Cessna\u2019s shadow cuts across the beaches of Boca Raton, just north of Miami. It was now 3 p.m. Tirado had been tailing the Cessna for nearly two hours, waiting, watching. ADVERTISEMENT The Customs pilots knew this was a critical moment in the chase, the moment when the Cessna pilot\u2014making landfall\u2014might first break the law. \u201cThe law requires that they stop at one of the first airports with Customs service, which means, basically, Miami, Fort Lauderdale\u2014Key West if they\u2019re coming from that direction,\u201d McCawley said in later court testimony. \u201cIf they overfly those airports, they are already committing a violation of the law.\u201d This Cessna was now 15 miles inland and was well past those airports. This was not a normal flight path for a pilot, say, casually returning from a vacation in The Bahamas. The Cessna\u2019s wings flashed in the sun. It was turning again, a big sweeping right turn, almost a full circle. McCawley knew that move. \u201cIt permits him to pretty well view the whole surrounding area to see if there are other aircraft in the area,\u201d he said. The pilot likely now knew the feds were tailing the Cessna. The pilot turned again, heading off-shore, flying uncertain, erratic almost, far above the breaking waves. The plane then turned back toward Florida then doubled back again toward the Bahamas. ADVERTISEMENT \u201cOn the way there, it was flying through clouds, flying very slowly, making turns,\u201d McCawley said. All this added up to one conclusion. The Cessna pilot was trying to flee. **TWO YEARS EARLIER \u2014 April 1981, Princeton, Minnesota \u2014 2,500 miles away from Miami** Bob Manary really wanted to get this guy. It was a cool spring day in Princeton, Minnesota, April 14, 1981. A Tuesday. Earlier you could\u2019ve seen your breath in the chilly air. It was a bit warmer now, but the wind still buffeted Manary\u2019s car, a nondescript, unmarked sedan owned by his TV station, WCCO, based in Minneapolis, about 50 miles to the southeast. Manary, 41, was a photojournalist, a wielder of one of those big shoulder-mounted TV cameras. Dave \u201cNim\u201d Nimmer, a WCCO reporter, was riding shotgun. They were following a mystery man by the name of Casey Ramirez, looking to interview him. ADVERTISEMENT Ramirez was riding in the back seat of a 1957 Chevy driven by Airport Commission Chairman Dick Nelles, a local insurance agent. Manary and Nimmer had just spotted Ramirez and were now tailing him. Manary, keeping pace with the Chevy, leaned forward for a closer look, curious, trying to see this mystery man, who didn\u2019t look back. This wasn\u2019t going to be a long chase. This was Princeton, after all, a small town of 3,000 people on the Rum River, surrounded by dairies and farm fields. There weren\u2019t many places for them to go. Few streets. And Manary knew them all well. ******** Manary was Princeton born and raised. He was born in 1940, then joined the Navy after graduating high school, flying F-4 Phantom fighter-bombers in Vietnam and elsewhere before returning home to Princeton in 1962. He started a local newspaper, grew it into an award-winning operation, then sold it to the competition. But journalism was in his blood. Now he lived in Minneapolis, working as a TV news photographer for WCCO, a CBS affiliate, Channel 4 on your TV dial. It suited him. WCCO had earned a reputation for its fearless news team. \u201cI was sent all over the world\u2014all over the world,\u201d Manary recalled in a recent interview. \u201cPlaces that you were shot at many times, the Berlin Wall and things like that.\u201d Manary earned the nickname \u201cBullet Bob\u201d in the newsroom because of how often he ended up in the middle of the action. He was a magnet for it. Nimmer, an experienced reporter about the same age as Manary, had agreed to join his colleague on his drive back to his sleepy hometown to liven up an otherwise slow news day, to look for this guy named Ramirez. It sounded like it could make for a good story. \u201c\u2018CCO was, at the time\u2014any story you could come up with, a good story\u2014\u2018go for it,\u2019 and it could be any place in the world,\u201d Manary said. So of course, with Bullet Bob\u2019s strange luck, he and Nim found themselves in a low-grade car chase in small-town Minnesota, chasing this mystery man. ******** The old Chevy stopped in front of Nelles\u2019 office in downtown Princeton. From a distance they saw Ramirez and Nelles head inside. Manary remembered then\u2014the office used to be a restaurant. It had a backdoor into an alley. He dropped off Nimmer out front. Classic pincer movement. Nimmer went through the front door; Manary pulled around the corner into the alley. His hunch was correct. There he was, Ramirez, the mystery man, apparently fleeing. He was in his 30s, of medium height, Hispanic features, straight dark hair, well dressed\u2014a blazer over a polo shirt unbuttoned at the neck. Manary pulled his unmarked car alongside Ramirez, all casual, and offered him a ride. He jumped in, anxious, hassled, grateful against the cold. Manary introduced himself as a local, name only. Ramirez lit up, flashing a big smile. \u201cOh, I know you,\u201d he said, with an accent that sounded like New York City. No you don\u2019t, Manary thought. Ramirez asked for a quick drive into the country, to escape some out-of-town TV news crew seeking an interview. Manary confessed the truth: He was from WCCO, actually, that TV news crew. So how about that interview? Ramirez reluctantly agreed to an on-camera interview, but on one condition: Don\u2019t show my face. Manary agreed. He didn\u2019t know much about Ramirez, really. He knew he was from out of town, seemed to already be good friends with Mayor Richard Anderson and some other big shots, and e had recently spent thousands of dollars on Princeton town projects. He also had a certain way about him. \u201cCasey\u2014you\u2019ve got to understand\u2014he was very charismatic,\u201d Manary recently recalled. \u201cIf he was talking to you here, he could win you right over.\u201d Ramirez had asked for the interview to take place in the office of Jerry Davis, the manager of the Princeton Co-op Credit Union, downtown. There, the WCCO duo got set up. Ramirez settled into a chair. It would be his first time on camera like this. It wouldn\u2019t be the last. ******** Manary had read about Ramirez's big spending in Princeton. Everyone in town had. It had been front-page local news. In December 1980, the Princeton Union-Eagle reported about Ramirez\u2019s plans to buy some airport land for about $42,500. It wasn't clear what he wanted to do with it, exactly. By March, Ramirez was generating bigger headlines\u2014spending big money, making big promises. Ramirez was \"a man in his early 30s, and holder of at least ...$1 million through air charter service and a computer corporation,\" wrote Princeton Union-Eagle reporter Joel Stottrup, in news coverage about the airport. Ramirez claimed to have \"offices in Miami, Phoenix, Hawaii, London and elsewhere.\" Ramirez was named the town\u2019s newest airport commissioner. After all, he seemed to be very interested in bailing out the town's airport, which despite town leaders' hopes of building it up, had become something of a municipal money pit \"It was nothing\u2014just kind of a grass field,\" Manary remembered in a recent interview. \u201cCasey [said], 'I\u2019ll do Princeton a great favor and build you a great big nice runway.'\" On March 2, 1981, Ramirez took his fellow airport commissioners and dozens of other Princetonians out to the The Farm Supper Club on Highway 95 for an official \"meeting\" featuring prime rib, champagne and entertainment. \u201cAbout 100 people that \u2018he wanted to get to know better,\u2019\u201d wrote Stottrup, who was there to cover the meeting. The reporter snapped a photo of Ramirez that was published in the paper. A mustachioed Ramirez was sporting a jacket and tie, dark glasses, laughing at a banquet table, holding court. He was flanked by big-shot Minneapolis criminal defense lawyer Ron Meshbesher, his wife Patti and Princeton Mayor Richard Anderson. \"Ramirez added a flavor to the commission meeting that some may not have been accustomed to,\u201d wrote Stottrup. \u201cThe flavor was an offer of quick solutions in the form of money to problems that the commission has been struggling to solve for months because of lack of money.\" The airport wasn\u2019t the only thing Ramirez was bankrolling. In the weeks after The Farm dinner, Ramirez agreed to back a $400,000 interest-free loan to fund construction of an municipal ice arena and offered $100,000 in fancy newfangled computers for City Hall. To Manary, it all sounded suspicious. Where was all this money coming from? Why was he putting it into the airport, City Hall and an ice arena? He worried Princeton was getting played by a smooth operator. \u201cIf you didn't know, you'd like the guy. He's, like, doing all these nice things for people and that sort of thing,\u201d Manary recalled later. \u201cBut I'd been around the horn for a few times, and yeah\u2014by time he got there, I knew what to watch for.\u201d Manary was protective of Princeton. It wasn\u2019t just his hometown\u2014it was a special place. \u201cWe always felt that growing up in Princeton was the best place in the world. Looking back on it today, I would not want anything changed,\u201d he said in a 1992 written recollection. \u201cThe world was not so complicated. We didn\u2019t have to worry about crime and drugs like today\u2019s children must do every day. We knew some of that was in the far off city but [it] couldn\u2019t affect us.\u201d But just about the time Ramirez popped up in Princeton, the town felt vulnerable to Manary. City Hall was having a hard time with its finances, and not just because of the airport. A newly completed highway bypass had sucked business out of downtown, just when the national economy was stuttering, giving Princeton a one-two economic gut punch. ******** Manary looked through his camera lens at Ramirez, and zoomed in\u2014a tight shot. Ramirez, knowing his face was obscured, looked right into the camera. Nimmer asked the big questions: Why Princeton? Who are you? What\u2019s with all the sudden generosity? Ramirez said he had first come to Princeton because it was the home of the Richard and Lois Bredemus family. Their daughter, also nicknamed Casey, had saved his life while Ramirez was in the Navy, he said. He had first visited to pay her back. As to all his money, he claimed he had won a patent on an aircraft wing part while playing poker, then was able to lease it for $5 million, which he invested in other business ventures. Ramirez bobbed his head sideways, his eyes shifting behind his large dark glasses. A flash of a smile. \u201cI come to Princeton here, they didn\u2019t care what my name was, who I was\u2014they were basically interested in my integrity \u2026 It was very touching,\u201d he said from the shadows, that touch of an NYC accent. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the problems out here of a lot of other communities, a lot of other countries,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re very fortunate....So I consider myself fortunate to be part of this community.\u201d The interview made Manary even more suspicious. And he wasn't alone. **THAT SAME MONTH \u2014 DEA Resident Office, Minneapolis** Michele Leonhart was back home but she felt out of place. There she was, 25, sitting alone at a desk in the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency's Minneapolis Resident Office, its local field office. Apparently this was to be her new desk. This was Leonhart\u2019s first day at her first duty post as a DEA special agent. \"I was in my suit, and had my little briefcase,\" she recently recalled. She had arrived at the office early, only to wait until a secretary arrived and let her in\u2014nobody else in the office. So where was everyone? She had grown up in and graduated high school in White Bear Lake, Minnesota, then got her associate degree in criminal justice from Lakewood Community College, before going up north to Bemidji State University. She had always wanted to be a police officer. She applied to the police departments in the 20 biggest U.S. cities, and all said no except one: Baltimore. Now those had been some mean streets\u2014very different from back home in Minnesota. In Baltimore, she learned fast, made plenty of arrests, impressed a lot of people. She decided she wanted to catch big fish with a national agency, so she attended the DEA academy, and graduated at the top of her class. She had earned the right to pick her first duty post. It had to be Miami, right? South Florida? That\u2019s what everyone thought was the natural choice. ******** South Florida in early 1981 was the hottest of spots for an ambitious new DEA agent. It was the front line in an escalating battle against international drug smugglers, who seemed to have endless resources, a predilection for violence and a bottomless supply. Cocaine was coursing through America\u2019s blood in 1981, much of it funneled from South America through South Florida, America\u2019s toe into the Caribbean. \u201cIn the drug world, everything revolved around Florida back then,\u201d Leonhart recalled in a recent interview. The smugglers were getting bolder by the day. Gone were the days when human \"mules\" would try to bring in small amount of cocaine on (or in) their person. The operationswere scaling upto meet the seemingly inexhaustible demand. Onecocaine kingpinhad even opened a transshipment point on a tiny island in The Bahamas\u2014white sand with a 3,300-foot crushed-coral airstrip, less than a two-hour flight from Florida. Pilots in small planes were flying in bales of pot and kilos of cocaine. Some would drop the drugs to speedboats to make delivery runs into secret coves on the coast. Others flew straight into the Sunshine State, dropping off loads of drugs at airstrips guarded by nobody but gators in the nearby swamps. The authorities were catching more and more of the deliveries but were also sure they were missing a lot of what was coming in. Cocaine seizures in the Miami area totaled 850 pounds in 1979. In 1980, authoritiesseized 3,900 pounds. In January 1981, the Miami Newsbegan publishing a regular graphicdepicting that month's drug seizures in Dade County, which encompassed Miami. With the rising tide of drugscame a wave of violence.Where there was drugs, there was money, and where there was money, there was crime. The DEA was doing what it could. It was an eight-year-old agency in 1981,founded in 1973at the forefront of President Richard Nixon\u2019s War on Drugs. But it had languished in the \u201870s as America's attitude toward drugs moved toward acceptance, including decriminalization of cannabis. Cocaine seemed like the next big thing. For users, it provided a short, euphoric high. Many considered it just as harmless as pot. For sellers, cocaine was easier to transport, and pound for pound, significantly more coveted, more lucrative. Yet cocaine remained expensive to get. It was difficult to source and hard to make. But the growing Medellin Cartel in Colombia\u2014led by a mustachioed up-and-comer namedPablo Escobar\u2014had refined ways to make cocaine in bulk. Now the cartel's challenge was to find ways to get its production past law enforcement into the United States, where there was endless demand\u2014tens of millions of Americans eager for the next big high. Every step of the cocaine production and delivery process generated a spider web of crime and misery. The supply lines were secured by violence, human suffering and corruption: lot of people, by force or by choice, looking the other way. Reagan, the newly elected Republican U.S. president, seemed eager to bring the full force of the government against the wave of cocaine then arriving in South Florida. The DEA would be on the forefront of this battle. All hands on deck. ******** Leonhart, the newly minted DEA agent, had earned the right to pick her first post. So assignment: Miami it was, right? She decided to go a different way. \u201cI picked Minneapolis,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s the only reason I ended up in Minneapolis. I figured [if] I was going to clean up the streets, I wanted to clean up in Minnesota\u2014I wanted to go back there and do what I could.\u201d Now her first case seemed to be figuring out why the Minneapolis DEA office was empty. She didn\u2019t need to sit long. Her new boss, Resident Agent in Charge Jim Braseth, walked in. Everyone was at a picnic, he said\u2014she should go home and change. At the picnic, Braseth wasted no time telling Leonhart about his plans for her first assignment. He wanted her to go undercover to investigate some mystery man up the road in the small town of Princeton. \u201cThis 'mysterious benefactor,' as they called him,\u201d Leonhart said. WCCO TV had just done a news report about him. He didn't seem to have any job or clear source of money, yet was ostentatiously wealthy. He went by the name Casey Ramirez. But before he told her all that, Braseth had a question for Leonhart. He knew how to set the hook. \u201cHey, how\u2019d you like to meet a millionaire?\u201d Notes: This article is based on interviews for this series with Leonhart, Manary, Nimmer and Don Shelby, as well as Ramirez trial transcripts and associated papers housed in the collections of the National Archives branch in Chicago, a 1992 recollection column by Manary, microfilmed copies of Princeton newspapers housed in the collections of theMinnesota History Centerin St. Paul, Princeton Union-Eagle photos archived by theMille Lacs County Historical Societyin Princeton,DEA historiesfor 1975-1980 and 1980-1985, a1982 congressional reportabout the drug war in South Florida, clips of WCCO news broadcastscollected online by TC Media Now,The 1995 PBS Frontline series\"The Godfather of Cocaine\"and the 2020 book \u201cThe Year of Dangerous Days: Riots, Refugees, and Cocaine in Miami 1980\"by Nicholas Griffin. Ramirez never responded to multiple interview requests. Stottrup declined to be interviewed. Deceased include Braseth (2000), Meshbesher (2018) and Nelles (2020). **<<< Read the introduction** **Follow the series** ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT AccountManage My AccountPrivacy PolicyTerms and ConditionsPolicies and StandardsSubscriber Benefits Manage My Account Privacy Policy Terms and Conditions Policies and Standards Subscriber Benefits Manage My Account Privacy Policy Terms and Conditions Policies and Standards Subscriber Benefits NewsSubscription OptionsEmail NewslettersE-PaperOur News Network Subscription Options Email Newsletters E-Paper Our News Network Subscription Options Email Newsletters E-Paper Our News Network ContactGet HelpContact Us\u200bAdvertise With UsGet Our Advertising NewsletterCareers Get Help Contact Us \u200bAdvertise With Us Get Our Advertising Newsletter Careers Get Help Contact Us \u200bAdvertise With Us Get Our Advertising Newsletter Careers MoreJobsHQClassifiedsPublic Notices JobsHQ Classifieds Public Notices JobsHQ Classifieds Public Notices Twitter Facebook"}
