RBI not only reduced interest rates by 25 bps but also changed its stance to accommodative from neutral. Inflation to remain under control as forecast of normal monsoon, record production of wheat and higher production of key pulses will ensure durable softening of food inflation. Also fall in crude oil price will keep inflation under check.If inflation remains under/around 4% for FY26 then the real rate at 200 bps is on the higher side and mostly will be reduced by cutting interest rates further. However, RBI would want to keep its arsenal intact if there is any disruption in the world order due to a tariff war. We believe RBI will watchfully go for couple of more cuts in little over as many policy meets. 10-year bond yield may not show immediate correction, but this policy has defined the near-term ceiling for it. **RBI MPC Live Updates: Mr Siddarth Bhamre, Head of Research at Asit C Mehta Investment Intermediates** With inflation forecast for FY26 at 4% the focus of RBI has completely shifted on the GDP growth as numbers got revised downwards to 6.5% from earlier 6.7%.

The continued focus on maintaining liquidity surplus\u2014through both operational tools such as \u20b980,000 crore in OMOs\u2014underscores its accommodative approach.

There is a risk of tariff war, which we need to watch out. However, since oil prices are down and commodity prices are in control, inflation risk is lower.

As I had mentioned earlier, since nearly 80% of Aadhar Housing Finance\u2019s existing borrowers are on floating rates this reduction will benefit them. At some stage soon this will lead to reduction in Aadhar RPLR thereby reducing EMI burden. The only wait now is for the banks to pass on this benefit to us.Furthermore, many first-time buyers in the Economically Weaker Section (EWS) and Lower Income Group (LIG) segments will now find it easier to take that crucial step towards home ownership as this move directly translates into lower EMIs and improved affordability. This proactive liquidity support from the central bank clubbed with government initiatives like PMAY 2.0, (SWAMIH) 2.0 fund, income tax exemptions, the introduction of a mortgage guarantee fund will positively accelerate housing demand and aid to government\u2019s vision of housing for all.\u201d **RBI MPC Live Updates: Mr. Rishi Anand, MD & CEO, Aadhar Housing Finance Ltd** \u201cThe additional 25-basis points rate cut to 6% by the Reserve Bank of India is a significant step in supporting growth and completely in line with the industry\u2019s expectations.

With inflationary pressures easing\u2014largely due to lower crude and food prices\u2014and downside risks to growth becoming more pronounced post the recent US tariff hikes, this policy move was timely and expected.The change in stance strengthens the case for a continued easing cycle. We expect this to translate into lower borrowing costs, particularly benefiting rate-sensitive sectors such as housing, automobiles, and MSMEs. Real estate, in particular, stands to gain as improved affordability may drive homebuyer sentiment and spur new demand.While the RBI has revised its GDP growth forecast for FY26 to 6.5%, external challenges, including trade disruptions and climate-related volatility, may exert further pressure. The outlook for inflation remains manageable at 4%, supported by expectations of a normal monsoon, though risks from extreme weather events must be closely watched.Overall, the policy action reflects a calibrated approach\u2014balancing growth support with macroeconomic stability\u2014and sets the tone for a data-driven, accommodative monetary trajectory in the months ahead. **RBI MPC Live News Updates: Aamar Deo Singh, Senior Vice President \u2013 Research at Angel One** The RBI\u2019s decision to cut the repo rate by 25 basis points to 6% and shift its policy stance to \u2018accommodative\u2019 signals a clear intent to support growth amid rising global uncertainties.

In a notable move, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) also shifted its stance from \u2018neutral\u2019 to \u2018accommodative\u2019, signaling the possibility of further rate cuts in the coming months.Forecast revisions further reinforced this shift in priorities. GDP growth for FY26 has been revised downward from 6.7% to 6.5%, while inflation expectations have been eased from 4.2% to 4%. This suggests that the RBI is placing greater emphasis on supporting growth, particularly in the face of rising external risks such as global trade tensions, while remaining confident that inflation will stay within manageable levels.Overall, the message is clear: the RBI is now more focused on its growth mandate.

This suggests that the RBI is placing greater emphasis on supporting growth, particularly in the face of rising external risks such as global trade tensions, while remaining confident that inflation will stay within manageable levels. Overall, the message is clear: the RBI is now more focused on its growth mandate. Given the current macroeconomic backdrop, we expect an additional 50\u201375 basis points of rate cuts in FY26, contingent on how the global trade situation evolves. 12:57 | April 9, 2025RBI MPC announcement from Shri Binod Kumar, MD & CEO of Indian Bank for your reference.Shri Binod Kumar, MD & CEO, Indian Bank:The RBI\u2019s 25 basis points reduction in the repo rate to 6% is a timely intervention. Change in stance to accommodative is sentimentally positive, allowing room for better liquidity and growth. Together, they will support both MSME and retail demand. The MSME sector which contributes nearly 30% to India\u2019s GDP and accounts for over 40% of exports, will benefit from this move as it will ease credit costs and improve cash flows, which are critical for recovery and growth in the evolving market dynamics. We foresee improved credit appetite at Indian Bank as MSMEs form a vital part of our lending portfolio. Increasing scope of colending will further strengthen lending to these sectors.This cut is likely to spur demand for home, auto, and personal loans, especially in tier 2 and tier 3 markets, where interest sensitivity is higher. Retail loans grew over 18% YoY as per recent trends and a lower rate environment could further accelerate consumption and support economic momentum. Indian Bank is fully geared to pass on the benefits swiftly and responsibly to our customers, ensuring inclusive credit growth. **RBI MPC announcement from Shri Binod Kumar, MD & CEO of Indian Bank for your reference.** Shri Binod Kumar, MD & CEO, Indian Bank: The RBI\u2019s 25 basis points reduction in the repo rate to 6% is a timely intervention.

While acknowledging that the global outlook is clouded with tariff uncertainties, it appears that RBI is more inclined to support growth. Domestic inflation has downside from crude prices and positive drivers from food inflation. While there is risk from imported inflation from currency, inflation is not as much of a concern as much as growth. Overall, the trajectory, despite being guarded has tilted towards a growth-inflation balance from inflation-growth in the previous regime, with a clear emphasis on supporting growth.While there is unknown from tariffs, another unknown is always the weather. While governor acknowledged that tariff related uncertainties are very high, if India is able to manage with lesser dent on inflation, then we can expect more rate cuts down the line. **RBI MPC 2025 Live Updates: Anitha Rangan, Economist, Equirus Securities, on RBI MPC\u2019s rate cut** RBI policy \u2013 A rate cut as expected, stance change to \u201caccommodation\u201d \u2013 growth support all the way.

The central bank\u2019s decision to revise FY26 GDP growth projections downward from 6.7% to 6.5% reflects realism, acknowledging that domestic demand alone may not be enough to offset external drags. Yet, with global trade fragmenting, export growth uncertain, and capital flows volatile, the economy has no choice except to double down on its most reliable engine: the Indian consumer. This isn\u2019t just about lowering interest rates; it\u2019s about reorienting the entire financial system to fuel consumption-led growth without leaving households and businesses drowning in debt.Financial institutions must move beyond passive rate transmission and actively shape lending toward high-impact sectors. Affordable housing, rural consumption, and small-business credit aren\u2019t just growth drivers they\u2019re lifelines for broader economic resilience. The focus should be on productive lending that boosts incomes, rather than merely spending. For instance, financing agri-tech startups that raise farm productivity puts more money in rural pockets, which then flows into FMCG, autos, and durables. Similarly, supporting MSMEs in tier-2 and tier-3 cities creates jobs that sustain urban consumption. This isn\u2019t trickle-down economics; it\u2019s a direct pipeline from credit to income to demand.But there\u2019s a catch: inflation and currency risks loom large. A consumption surge that relies on imported goods such as electronics or energy could backfire by widening the trade deficit and pressuring the rupee. The solution lies in targeting credit at sectors that stimulate local production renewable energy, food processing, and manufacturing to keep demand leakage in check. Banks must also avoid the trap of reckless retail lending, where easy EMIs today become NPAs tomorrow.The path forward demands precision. Fiscal policy must complement monetary easing think tax cuts for middle-income earners, better supply chains to curb food inflation, and incentives for domestic manufacturing. If executed right, India\u2019s consumption story won\u2019t just offset global drags; it could redefine emerging-market resilience. But if mishandled, we risk repeating the boom-bust cycles of the past. The RBI has fired the starting gun. Now, lenders and policymakers must run the race with discipline. **RBI MPC Live Updates: Quote by Mr. Tarun Singh Founder & MD, Highbrow Securities** The RBI\u2019s recent 25-basis-point rate cut, bringing the repo rate to 6%, is more than just a monetary policy adjustment; it\u2019s a calculated gamble on India\u2019s ability to defy global headwinds through the sheer force of domestic demand.

This is particularly beneficial for Indian enterprises looking to strengthen their domestic presence and explore emerging global opportunities arising from the ongoing tariff war.\u201d 11:53 | April 9, 2025Sonal Varma, Managing Director and Chief Economist (India and Asia ex-Japan), Nomura.\u201cThe RBI has delivered a dovish 25bp rate cut. The combination of downgrades to its GDP growth and inflation projections and the change in stance to accommodative all reinforce that this is a dovish cut. With inflation at target, the MPC\u2019s focus is supporting growth, amid rising downside risks to growth from US tariffs. Despite the growth forecast downgrade, the RBI\u2019s FY26 GDP forecast of 6.5% still appears optimistic to us. We believe the combination of direct and indirect effects will result in GDP growth slowing more sharply to around 6% in FY26, and risks are skewed to the downside. Hence, we expect the rate cutting cycle to continue, with a 25bp cut each in June and August.\u201d **Sonal Varma, Managing Director and Chief Economist (India and Asia ex-Japan), Nomura.** \u201cThe RBI has delivered a dovish 25bp rate cut.

The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) unanimously decided to reduce the repo rate by 25 basis points, lowering it from 6.25% to 6.00%. Alongside the rate cut, the policy stance was shifted from neutral to accommodative, signaling the central bank\u2019s readiness to ease further if required. This shift narrows future options to either maintaining the current rate or implementing additional cuts, depending on evolving economic conditions.In addition to the repo rate, other key policy rates were also revised. The standing deposit facility (SDF) rate was lowered to 5.75%, while both the marginal standing facility (MSF) and the bank rate were set at 6.25%. The RBI also revised its macroeconomic outlook\u2014bringing down the inflation forecast for FY26 to 4%, and trimming the GDP growth projection from 6.7% to 6.5%, reflecting the challenges posed by the global economic environment.This decision comes on the back of a sustained moderation in retail inflation. In February 2025, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) fell to 3.61%, well within the central bank\u2019s target band of 4% \u00b1 2%. The drop in inflation has created the necessary space for monetary easing, with the latest rate cut expected to reduce borrowing costs for both households and businesses, thereby aiding credit growth and demand revival.Overall, the RBI\u2019s latest policy measures are aimed at preserving long-term macroeconomic stability while addressing near-term risks. By enhancing liquidity and reducing interest rates, the central bank seeks to support domestic momentum, counterbalance external shocks such as global trade disruptions and U.S. tariff actions, and create a more conducive environment for sustainable economic growth.\u201d **Quote on RBI Monetary policy by Mr. Ajit Mishra \u2013 SVP, Research, Religare Broking Ltd** \u201cThe Reserve Bank of India, in its monetary policy meeting held on April 9, 2025, announced a series of proactive steps aimed at supporting economic growth amid mounting global uncertainties and subdued inflation.

Here is the view from Pranay Aggarwal - Director & CEO of StoxkartRBI\u2019s 25 bps rate cut to 6% and shift to an accommodative stance signals a growth-focused policy. I view this as positive for liquidity and demand recovery. Rate-sensitive sectors like banks, NBFCs, real estate, and autos stand to gain. While banks may see some NIMs compression (Fitch estimates ~10 bps in FY26), improved credit offtake could balance it. Lower rates should boost home and vehicle loan demand.
