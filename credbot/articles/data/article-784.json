Ezri Henry has spent the past year running a lemonade stand on Gingerbread Lane, raising money to attendspace camp at the U.S. Space & Rocket Centerin Huntsville, Alabama. \"We found an astronaut on Instagram,\u201d Ezri said. \u201cMy mom commented that I want to be an astronaut when I grow up, and she said to start at space camp.\u201d The young entrepreneur has already sold $1,800 worth of lemonade, even switching to hot chocolate during the winter months to keep her business going. \"I've always really liked the stars,\" Ezri said. \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to know if aliens are real, so I just wanna know.\u201d Her family and her mother, Cidne Henry, have supported the venture while teaching valuable life lessons along the way \u2014 from building the lemonade stand from the ground up to learning about the cost to run a business. \"I like to give my kids a business mindset of ... we earn what we get, and I feel like if she earns it, that she's gonna take it more seriously,\" Cidne said. The space camp experience will give Ezri the opportunity to train like an astronaut, experience zero gravity, participate in space simulations and more. \"I think that my goal as a mother for her, with this whole experience, would not be to teach her that she has to be an astronaut, but to show her that if she wanted to be, she could,\" Cidne said. With just 13 days until departure, Ezri has already reached her financial goal. Any additional funds she raises will go toward souvenirs and a space suit. The community response has been overwhelming, according to her mother. \"We had more people come to visit her than I could even imagine,\" Cidne said. As for Ezri's ultimate ambition? \"I just have a life goal to be the first woman on Mars,\" she said. Cidne said to keep an eye out for updates on the Blue Springs Community Facebook page, where the Henrys will post if Ezri has her stand set up on the corner of SE Picadilly Street and SE Gingerbread Lane. \u2014 Report a typo **Sign up for theBreaking News Newsletterand receive up to date information.** **now signed up to receive theBreaking News Newsletter.** **Let's Talk!** **Let's Talk!** Weather KSHB Traffic News Money Sports Entertainment Life Video Apps Don't Waste Your Money Support Sitemap Do Not Sell My Info Privacy Policy Privacy Center Journalism Ethics Guidelines Terms of Use EEO Careers 1.0 Host Exhibit KSHB FCC Public Files KMCI FCC Public Files FCC Application Public File Contact Accessibility Statement Scripps Media Trust Center Closed Captioning Contact kshb41 kshb41 kshb41"}
