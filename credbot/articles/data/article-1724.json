By Published US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth delivered an extremely hawkish speech in which he demonized China as a \u201cthreat\u201d and said, \u201cWe are preparing for war\u201d. \u201cThose who long for peace, must prepare for war. And that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re doing. We are preparing for war, in order to deter war \u2014 to achieve peace through strength\u201d, Hegseth stated. The top Donald Trump administration official made these aggressiveremarks at the Shangri-La Dialogue 2025, a summit held in Singapore on 31 May. \u201cThe threat China poses is real, and it could be imminent. We hope not, but it certainly could be\u201d, Hegseth claimed, indicating that the Pentagon waspreparing for a war over Taiwan. \u201cBeyond our borders and beyond our neighborhood, we are reorienting toward deterring aggression by Communist China\u201d, he stressed. **The message of Trump\u2019s Pentagon: war is peace** The Trump administration\u2019s Pentagon has essentially pushed the message \u201cwar is peace\u201d. Hegseth has incessantly reiterated the slogan \u201cpeace through strength\u201d. \u201cPresident Trump said it himself [in May] in Riyadh \u2013 and will never hesitate to wield American power swiftly and decisively if necessary. That is re-establishing deterrence\u201d, the defense secretary emphasized in Singapore. Hegseth is a war hawk and a religious fundamentalist. He made his name as a former host on the conservative TV network Fox News, where Trump discovered him. In 2020, Hegseth published a book called \u201cAmerican Crusade\u201d, in which he proudly identified as a \u201ccrusader\u201d and wrote that the US right wing iswaging a \u201choly war\u201d against China, the international left, and Islam. \u201cCommunist China will fall\u2014and lick its wounds for another two hundred years\u201d, he promised in the extremist book. **Trump admin pressures Asia-Pacific countries to minimize \u201ceconomic cooperation with China\u201d** In hisspeech in Singapore in May 2025, Pete Hegseth noted that it was his second time in his four months serving as secretary of defense that he had visited the Asia-Pacific region (which Washington has sought to rebrand as the \u201cIndo-Pacific\u201d). In March, Hegseth traveled to Japan and the Philippines, where hethreatened China and boasted of US \u201cwar-fighting\u201d preparationsand \u201creal war plans\u201d. At the Shangri-La Dialogue conference, Hegseth half-jokingly threatened the Asia-Pacific region with his endless presence. \u201cI\u2019m certainly proud to be back into the Indo-Pacific for the second time as the secretary of defense. And I\u2019m going to keep coming back, and back, and back again. You\u2019re stuck with me\u201d, he said. The US defense secretary pressured nations in the region to minimize their economic relations with China. The Trump administration essentially told countries that they must choose between either the United States or China \u2014 that they can\u2019t have good relations with both sides, becausea war could be coming soon. Hegseth said (emphasis added): Facing these threats, we know that many countries aretempted by the idea of seeking both economic cooperation with China and defense cooperation with the United States. Now that is a geographic necessity for many. Butbeware the leverage that the CCP seekswith that entanglement.Economic dependence on Chinaonly deepens their malign influence andcomplicates our defense decision spaceduring times of tension. **China opposes hegemony, while the US empire seeks it** Defense Secretary Hegseth claimed in his May speech in Singapore that, supposedly, \u201cChina seeks to become a hegemonic power in Asia. No doubt\u201d. This is false. China has consistently emphasized, over decades, that it does not seek hegemony. In fact, Beijing does not want any country to have hegemony. Principled opposition to hegemony has been a constant since the founding of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) under Mao Zedong in 1949, through the Reform and Opening Up initiated by Deng Xiaoping in 1978, and into the New Era launched by President Xi Jinping in 2012. The Chinese government has always stressed what it calls its \u201cunequivocal commitment to supporting other developing countries in their efforts to defend national sovereignty, develop national economy andfight imperialism, colonialism, and hegemonism\u201d. In a speech at the United Nations General Assembly in 1974, Deng Xiaoping stated, \u201cIf one day China should change her color and turn into a superpower, if she too should play the tyrant in the world, and everywhere subject others to her bullying, aggression, and exploitation, the people of the world should identify her as social-imperialism, expose it, oppose it, and work together with the Chinese people to overthrow it\u201d. In fact, when the PRC normalized diplomatic relations with the United States and Japan in the 1970s, a source of diplomatic tension was China\u2019s insistence that, in the joint statements signed by Beijing and Washington and Beijing and Tokyo, therehad to be an \u201canti-hegemony\u201d clause. It is actually the United States that has consistently sought to impose its hegemony on the rest of the world. This was spelled out clearly in a 1992 document published by the US Department of Defense, known as the Wolfowitz Doctrine (because it was co-written by Paul Wolfowitz, who then served as US under secretary of defense for policy, before later returning as secretary of defense under George W. Bush). The Pentagon\u2019sWolfowitz Doctrine stated(emphasis added): Our first objective is to prevent the re-emergence of a new rival. This is a dominant consideration underlying the new regional defense strategy and requires that we endeavor to prevent any hostile power from dominating a region whose resources would, under consolidated control, be sufficient to generate global power. These regions include Western Europe,East Asia, the territory of the former Soviet Union, and Southwest Asia. The Trump administration\u2019s foreign policy is still consistent with much of the Wolfowitz Doctrine. Although Trump has de-prioritized Western Europe and the territory of the former USSR, he has dedicated significant resources to US military operations in East Asia and Southwest Asia (also known as the Middle East). In fact, the main theme of Hegseth\u2019s speech was that the Pentagon will not accept China challenging US dominance in the Asia-Pacific region. \u201cWe will not be pushed out of this critical region\u201d, Hegseth said, in a clear message to Beijing. This was the US empire stating clearly that it seeks to impose its hegemonic control over East Asia. **Bipartisan warmongering in Washington** This aggressive anti-China stance is bipartisan in Washington. A former top Joe Biden administration official said he agreed with the thrust of the anti-China policy pursued by Pete Hegseth, a right-wing extremist and religious fanatic. Ely Ratner, who served as the assistant secretary of defense for Indo-Pacific security affairs in Biden\u2019s Pentagon, wrote approvingly on Twitter/X, \u201cRhetoric aside, on actual defense policy Secretary Hegseth\u2019s speech wasnear total continuity with the previous administration\u201d. \u201cThat\u2019s good, but we\u2019ll need heightened urgency, attention, and resources to address the China challenge\u201d, Ratner added. Biden\u2019s neoconservative Secretary of State Antony Blinken had also maintained a hardline anti-China position. In a speech in 2022,Blinken announced what was essentially a containment policy targeting China. \u201cWe cannot rely on Beijing to change its trajectory. So we will shape the strategic environment around Beijing\u201d, he said. Blinken added, \u201cThe scale and the scope of the challenge posed by the People\u2019s Republic of China will test American diplomacy like nothing we\u2019ve seen before\u201d.

Historians know the demise of previous empires was because of bankruptcy caused by military overreach. The only reason that the FSA has not yet gone bankrupt is the ongoing USD International Reserve Currency / Petrodollar status.This is ending. The recent conference of China, the GCC and ASEAN in KL served to solidify the mechanisms by which countries will trade outside the USD and this trend will take off like wildfire around the world. US Treasuries also face collapse in due course, the recent huge shock being that even the vassal Japanese started selling off TBills in response to the Trump tariff fiasco, contrary to all expectations of FSA financial geniuses.The US dollar is inexorably going downhill\u2026https://youtu.be/zTuwIr8c11k The FSA could not defeat the impoverished Vietnamese,The FSA could not defeat the impoverished Afghans,The FSA could not defeat the impoverished Yemenis,The FSA cannot defeat hypersonic missile armed Iran,The FSA cannot defeat hypersonic missile armed Russia,The FSA cannot defeat hypersonic missile armed China.Who is Pig Hogsbreath kidding?Hogsbreath must stop his clownish macho posturing and prove his cojones by kitting up and going to the Ukraine Frontline to fight alongside other tattooed fascist porky pink porky pigs who tell porky pies.Ain\u2019t gonna happen because Pigboy has no cojones, he is in reality just a big mouthed coward who has one testicle less than Hitler. He is not a warhawk, he is a CAWP, a Chickenshit Armchair Warmongering Psychopath.The only place Pigboy belongs is a fly ridden shit filled pig pen.
