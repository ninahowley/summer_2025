Gavin Newsom posted on X along with a letter supporting the rioters. Every single Democrat received the memo that the plan to \u201cfight Trump\u201d entails permitting their minions to burn down another city. In addition to 4,000 National Guard troops, the White House has deployed a group of 700 Marines to save the city of Los Angeles. Yet, every single Democratic governor does not care about the welfare of our troops or legal citizens. Multiple police officers have sustained injuries after these political activists pelted them with rocks and bricks. Someone even attempted to set a police horse on fire. The scene is completely uncivilized, depraved chaos that not one Democratic governor will condemn. I reported how this isstate-funded chaoswith California paying NGOs millions to raise hell with taxpayer funds. We are witnessing the Black Lives Matter chaos repeat with precisely the same actors. We saw similar events at college campuses last year. Professional agitators are leading the riots and ensuring that they continue. A group of masked individualsdistributed riot shields and gas masksto the mostly peaceful protestors. Witnesses say that local law enforcement failed to intervene as the masked individuals distributed tactical gear. A group is arming \u201ccivilians\u201d to fight back against the US military. This means that an outside influence, perhaps foreign in the case of Soros, has chosen to attack American forces. This is blatant terrorism at best, and an act of war at worst. #BREAKINGWe just saw people arrive in Downtown L.A. with truck loads of Bionic Face Shields that demonstrators quickly grabbed. It certainly seems like gear you'd wear if you're preparing for conflict with police. Who is funding this?pic.twitter.com/2hZphafOsi \u2014 Elex Michaelson (@Elex_Michaelson)June 10, 2025 LAPD Chief Jim McDonnell admitted that professional agitators are fueling the literal fires. \u201cWhen I look at the people who are out there doing the violence, that\u2019s not the people that we [see] during the day.\u201d BREAKING: LAPD Chief Admits Professional Left-Wing Anarchists Are Fueling the Violence in Los Angeles Riots This reeks of a Soros op. LAPD Chief Jim McDonnell just exposed what many already suspected\u2014the chaos unfolding in Los Angeles is being escalated by professional leftist\u2026pic.twitter.com/7vx7lnoyfA \u2014 The Vigilant Fox ? (@VigilantFox)June 9, 2025 He continued to say that the LAPD is not battling the typical civilian. \u201cThese are people who are all hooded up. They\u2019ve got a hoodie on. They\u2019ve got face masks on. They\u2019re people who do this all the time. Get away with whatever they can. Go out there from one civil unrest situation to another, using the same or similar tactics frequently. They are connected. Some would call them anarchists. They\u2019re people that we run across routinely, city to city, and this is what they do. Many of the people who are doing this come in from other places just to hurt people and to cause havoc.\u201d The people are not fighting back against Trump or ICE. Rather, a select group of paid actors has been incentivized and ordered to destroy a city for political purposes. Thousands of people did not simply take to the streets over deportation. This was a carefully planned and well-coordinated political movement. The Democrats are allowing it to happen and speaking favorably of the paid agitators who they want the public to believe are outraged liberal voters. FBI Director Kash Patel described the city of LA as \u201cunder siege,\u201d and promised to hunt down the mostly peaceful protestors who are physically attacking federal officers and government buildings. Unlike the Black Lives Matter protests, we have some semblance of law and order across the Trump Administration, and those responsible will hopefully see their day in court. More importantly, those responsible for creating the event need to face their day in court. These are often foreign entities that are deliberately meddling in US politics. Imagine if this were the response to any conservative cause? It would never happen. The extremists on the left have been permitted to unleash terror when they feel they are losing power without repercussion. America\u2019s enemies are watching with enthusiasm as they see how broken our system has become. One party in our two-party system is ready to wage war against the other and is counting on the situation to escalate. How far will they go? **Blog Alerts** Subscribe to alerts for each new postSubscribe for free to our daily news \u0394 June 10, 2025 June 9, 2025 June 9, 2025 June 7, 2025 June 6, 2025 Armstrong
