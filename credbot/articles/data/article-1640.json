She ran a final time of 41 seconds flat, setting a new meet record at Jesse Owens Stadium in Columbus in the process. She entered the race with the best time out of Friday\u2019s prelim heats and wasted no time speeding ahead in Saturday\u2019s final. Brown won by 1.13 seconds and was only .21 seconds off the state meet record. Six total local athletes reached the podium Saturday during day two of the OHSAA State Track and Field Championships. During the Division III competition, Cedarville\u2019s Bradyn Long finished in eighth place in the boys 300 meter hurdles final with a time of 39.76. Legacy Christian\u2019s Caroline Hamilton got seventh in the girls 3200 meter run running the race in 11:18.75. In D-II, Carroll\u2019s Ruby Gross made a late push to secure a podium spot, finishing eighth in the girls 1600 meter run by running a time of 4:56.32. Beavercreek had multiple placers in D-I. Enora McEllroy got third in both the seated girls 400 and 100 meters, and Zoe Roll finished fourth in the seated girls 100 meter dash. Brown was also the runner-up in the girls 100 meter hurdles after taking third a year ago.
