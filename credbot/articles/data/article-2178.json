And truly, there\u2019s something *extra* delicious about kicking back with a cup of coffee that someone else made for you. The coffee just tastes better, even if it\u2019s similar to what you\u2019d make on your own. **Experts in This Article** clinical psychologist, associate professor at NYU Langone, and co-host of theMind In Viewpodcast assistant professor of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at Vanderbilt University Medical Center clinical associate professor of psychiatry at New York Presbyterian Hospital TikTok'sGabrielle Dianeerecently went viral for breaking down her, what she calls, \u201ccurrent delusion\u201d of putting her coffee in a disposable to-go cup to try to capture the same feeling she\u2019d get if she bought it. People flooded the comments of her post with messages about how they can relate to this urge. \u201cIt tastes better that way, too. I swear,\u201d one wrote. \u201cIt scratches my brain differently,\u201d another said. While the convenience factor is undeniable, experts say there\u2019s more to a to-go coffee than just being easy. Here's what experts have to say about why we love a to-go coffee so much. **Why does coffee taste better when someone makes it for you?** There are likely a few things happening here. Taste is a perception, and it can be influenced by internal and external factors, explainsGail Saltz, MD, clinical associate professor of psychiatry atNew York Presbyterian Hospital Weill-Cornell School of Medicineand host of theHow Can I Help?podcast. While the coffee technically doesn\u2019t taste any different when someone makes it for you (unless their technique is actually better than yours), the experience of someone doing something for you is powerful, saysAaron Brinen, PsyD, an assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences atVanderbilt University Medical Center. \u201cIt\u2019s that interpersonal experience and a show of caring,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re tribal creatures and we respond strongly to that.\u201d Brinen says that this gesture can cause a release of feel-good chemicals likeserotoninin the brain, making you feel cozy when you\u2019re sipping on your coffee. That can influence your taste perception, he points out. Brinen says he\u2019s personally experienced this. \u201cEven when I made the coffee earlier, if my wife brings a cup to me, it tastes better to me than when I had a cup I had made earlier in the day,\u201d he says. Buying a cup of coffee at a store that someone made for you can have a similar effect, according toThea Gallagher, PsyD, a clinical assistant professor atNYU Langone Healthand a cohost of theMind in Viewpodcast. \u201cYou get a little dopamine bump,\u201d she says. Even if the coffee is the same as what you\u2019d drink at home, \u201cit feels like you\u2019re buying yourself a treat,\u201d Gallagher says. There may even be an evolutionary instinct at play, according to Brinen. \u201cHumans have the ability to come together and to organize,\u201d he says. \u201cThat is what has allowed us to survive and ultimately thrive.\u201d As a result, someone handing a cup of coffee to you can tap into a biological urge to rely on others. \u201cWay back when, some people hunted and others gathered,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re biologically designed for that.\u201d So next time you seek out a special treat, know that biology and evolution may have a hand in it. **PSA: You Might Be Eligible for a Free Nutritionist\u2014Here\u2019s How to Check** **PSA: You Might Be Eligible for a Free Nutritionist\u2014Here\u2019s How to Check** **High-Protein Tahini Date Shake** **High-Protein Tahini Date Shake** **Almost 2 Million Eggs Have Been Recalled Over Salmonella Concerns** **Almost 2 Million Eggs Have Been Recalled Over Salmonella Concerns** Some people are more susceptible to this taste perception than others, though. \u201cIt\u2019s not universal that coffee tastes better if someone makes it for you,\u201d Saltz says. \u201cBut for those people who associate someone making coffee for them as either a treat, or an expression of love and caring, or a reflection of getting themselves something special, then this can give a psychological boost to the way they are perceiving their coffee taste.\u201d **This taps into the experience surrounding coffee, too.** Many people mentally link their coffee with having some downtime, and getting a literal break from having to make your own cup can make the drink\u2019s taste even better, according to Saltz. **The 12 Best Warm-Weather Cocktails** **The 12 Best Warm-Weather Cocktails** **The 5 Best Ice Cream Makers** **The 5 Best Ice Cream Makers** **Not Only Do You Deserve a Little Treat\u2014There Are Benefits, Too** **Not Only Do You Deserve a Little Treat\u2014There Are Benefits, Too** \u201cIt may be associated with a lovely morning or a justified break in the afternoon, or even a dessert-like ending to a meal,\u201d Saltz says. \u201cThese are all associated experiences which can be additive to the \u2018just a drink\u2019 experience.\u201d Brinen co-signs this. \u201cCoffee people love their rituals,\u201d he points out. And, W+G is always a big advocate ofgoing on a walk for your mental health. Why not add a delicious beverage as well? **Can this happen with other foods and drinks, too?** Short answer: Yep. While Gallagher points out that coffee is unique in that so many people have rituals and emotional associations around the drink, she says you may feel like food and other drinks taste better when someone makes them for you, too. \u201cIt\u2019s all about your associations with these things and what they mean to you,\u201d she says. So, if your mom always made grilled cheese for you as a child when you needed a pick-me-up, it might taste better when you buy it at a restaurant versus making it for yourself at home. On the flip side, if someone gives you a food you\u2019re neutral about, like carrot sticks, you may not have that same taste perception. **How to mimic this feeling by yourself** If you live with someone, Brinen says that asking them to make you a cup of coffee here and there can help to capture this feeling. If they make you a cup without you asking, the \u201ctaste\u201d may be even better due to the kind gesture, he adds. But, you can still capture the sensation of having someone make your coffee for you at home alone. \u201cConsider buying the same syrups that you can get at your local coffee shop and have a mug that makes you feel good,\u201d Gallagher says. This can help tap into that emotional feeling of someone making your coffee by mimicking the actual taste, she adds. Saltz recommends doing \u201canything positive\u201d that you can when you drink your coffee to enhance the experience. That may be adding cinnamon to your drink, using a milk frother, or listening to relaxing music. \u201cAdding something positive to the experience can enhance the experience and the taste,\u201d Saltz says. And, if you get the chance, consider making a cup of coffee for someone special in your life. If nothing else, you\u2019ll love hearing about how great it tastes. **Sign Up for Our Daily Newsletter** **Get all the latest in wellness, trends, food, fitness, beauty, and more delivered right to your inbox.** ...
