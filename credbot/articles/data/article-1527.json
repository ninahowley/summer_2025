The FDA has approved Nuvaxovid, the non-mRNA COVID vaccine from Novavax. That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that everyone is going to be able to get this COVID vaccine though. **The Novavax COVID Vaccine Has Been Approved** Unlike other COVID vaccines, the FDA approval for Nuvaxovid is limited to: adults 65 years and older individuals 12 through 64 years who have at least one underlying condition that puts them at high risk for severe outcomes from COVID-19 While unusual for a COVID vaccine, these restrictions may not be as big a deal as some people might think though. Why not? There is a good chance that the folks at ACIP were going to switch to a non-universal recommendation for COVID vaccines soon. A non-universal recommendation that would mean certain high-risk age groups and those with certain high-risk conditions should still get a vaccine. And of course, the other big thing that makes the FDA limitations a bit of a non-factor is that the great majority of people have at least one condition that puts them at risk for severe COVID! What kind of conditions? In general, condition that put people at risk for severe COVID can include asthma, diabetes, and being immunosuppressed, etc. \u201cDiversity in vaccine production helps increase the number of patients vaccinated,\u201d says Dr. Florescu. \u201cSome might not accept mRNA vaccines, while others may be allergic to certain ingredients.\u201d And that means that most people will be able to get the newly approved Nuvaxovid, the non-mRNA COVID vaccine from Novavax if they want it. \u201cThe Novavax vaccine is the only non-mRNA updated COVID vaccine that has been available in the U.S. This vaccine is a protein adjuvant that had a 90% efficacy in its clinical trial, performing almost as well as the mRNA vaccines in their early trials. It is simpler to make than some of the other vaccines and can be stored in a refrigerator, making it easier to distribute.\u201d A vaccine that had already been approved for emergency use and has been preferred by some who believe it causes fewer side effects than other COVID vaccines. **More on COVID Vaccines** Do COVID Vaccines Cause Bell\u2019s Palsy?
