It may save a life! No amount of underage drinking is safe. And we know that underage drinking can lead to consuming too much alcohol, which may result in poor decisions, injuries, alcohol overdose, and possibly death. **It\u2019s About Your Teen** A teenager\u2019s brain is still developing, and it is very sensitive to alcohol\u2019s effects on judgment and decision-making. Tragedies can\u2014and do\u2014happen, so underage drinking should not be a part of any end-of-year celebration. **The Effects of Alcohol Can Be Deceptive** If you are asked to explain the reasons behind your rules, you can describe the effects of alcohol on the human body. When people drink alcohol, they may temporarily feel elated and happy, but they should not be fooled. As blood alcohol level rises, the effects on the body\u2014and the potential risks\u2014multiply. For example: Inhibitions and memory become affected, so people may say and do things that they will regret later and possibly not remember doing at all. Decision-making skills are affected, so people may be at greater risk for driving under the influence\u2014and risking an alcohol-related traffic crash\u2014or making unsafe decisions about sex. Aggression can increase, potentially leading to everything from verbal abuse to physical fights. Coordination and physical control are also impacted. When drinking leads to loss of balance, slurred speech, and blurred vision, even normal activities can become more dangerous. Consuming a dangerously high amount of alcohol can also lead to alcohol overdose and death. When people drink too much, they may eventually pass out (lose consciousness). Reflexes like gagging and breathing can be suppressed. That means people who have had too much alcohol could vomit and choke, or just stop breathing completely. The risk of an overdose can increase if alcohol is consumed while taking opioids or sedative hypnotics, such as sleep and anti-anxiety medications. Combining these medications with alcohol can be dangerous and life-threatening. **Think About It!** Drinking to celebrate graduation can result in vandalism, arrests, sexual assaults, injuries and trips to the emergency room, alcohol-related traffic crashes, and worse. Drinking by teens can put them\u2014and their friends\u2014in real danger. Ask them to consider this question: Is that any way to celebrate? **Talk With Your Graduate** It is critical to talk with your graduate because research shows that parents do make a difference. By serving as a positive role model, talking with other parents and your teens, supervising parties to make sure no alcohol is served, and supporting alcohol-free school celebrations, you can help prevent a life-changing mistake. **Remember \u2026** Tell your graduate to play it safe and party right\u2014and alcohol-free\u2014at graduation, because a well-deserved celebration shouldn\u2019t end in tragedy. **A Word About Alcohol Overdose** Thousands of students are transported to the emergency department each year for alcohol overdose, which occurs when high levels of alcohol suppress the nervous and respiratory systems. Signs of this dangerous condition can include: Slow or irregular breathing Slow or irregular breathing Slow or irregular breathing Vomiting Vomiting Vomiting Mental confusion, stupor, loss of consciousness, or coma Mental confusion, stupor, loss of consciousness, or coma Mental confusion, stupor, loss of consciousness, or coma Hypothermia or low body temperature, bluish or pale skin Hypothermia or low body temperature, bluish or pale skin Hypothermia or low body temperature, bluish or pale skin An alcohol overdose can lead to permanent brain damage or death, so a person showing any of these signs requires immediate medical attention. If you or your graduate notices any of these signs, don\u2019t wait. Call 911 if you suspect an alcohol overdose. **For more information, please visit:collegedrinkingprevention.gov** Print Updated:September 2024 Site Map Contact Us Disclaimer Alcohol Policy Information System Alcohol Research: Current Reviews (ARCR) Alcohol Treatment Navigator College Drinking Prevention NIAAA Facts About Teen Drinking NIAAA Spectrum Rethinking Drinking niaaa.nih.gov An official website of theNational Institutes of Healthand theNational Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism About NIAAA Accessibility FOIA Privacy Policy Vulnerability Disclosure"}
