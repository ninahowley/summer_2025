He has named the new firm Safe Superintelligence (SSI Inc.) and the focus on \u201csafety\u201d cannot be missed here. Reportedly, Sutskever quit OpenAI as he and Sam Altman had differing opinions about how OpenAI should balance growth while ensuring AI stays safe for humanity. Ex-OpenAI engineer Daniel Levy and former Y Combinator partner Daniel Gross worked with Sutskever to cofound SSI together.In its release, SSI said, \u201cBuilding safe superintelligence (SSI) is the most important technical problem of our time.\u201d It said that the company\u2019s investors and business model are aligned to achieve safe superintelligence. The release added, \u201cWe approach safety and capabilities in tandem, as technical problems to be solved through revolutionary engineering and scientific breakthroughs. We plan to advance capabilities as fast as possible while making sure our safety always remains ahead.\u201d We will pursue safe superintelligence in a straight shot, with one focus, one goal, and one product. We will do it through revolutionary breakthroughs produced by a small cracked team.

It threatens to harm privacy in the short term and, in the long term, it could take over the world. The privacy fears were well illustrated whenMicrosoft revealed its new \u201cRecall\u201d feature for Copilot+ PCs at its Build conferenceevent last month. The feature will record essentially everything you do on your PC to enable it to retrieve snapshots for you, enabling a potentially massive breach of privacy. After much online furor, Microsoft announced that it won\u2019t be a default feature on the device. Apple perhaps learned from that saga and, at theWorldwide Developer Conference earlier this month,said that safety would be the core of Apple Intelligence, even as it delivers personalized experiences. Apple Intelligence would run on severallarge language models(LLMs) many of which would run on the device itself. According to SSI, \u201cOur singular focus means no distraction by management overhead or product cycles, and our business model means safety, security, and progress are all insulated from short-term commercial pressures.\u201d OpenAI Co-Founder launches new AI company Ilya Sutskever, who was OpenAI's chief scientist, has founded new AI safety company Safe Superintelligence Inc (SSI). The newly founded AI company's has one goal and one product: a safe superintelligence.SSI states that: \u201cBuilding\u2026pic.twitter.com/6SJmQsYvxa \u2014 The Upload (@theuploadweekly)June 20, 2024 **SSI It Putting a Lot of Focus on Safety** While Sutskever hasn\u2019t revealed the company\u2019s investors and financial backers, speaking withBloomberg\u2019s Ashlee Vancehe said that the company \u201cwill be fully insulated from the outside pressures of having to deal with a large and complicated product and having to be stuck in a competitive rat race.\u201d Meanwhile, it remains to be seen how the company advances in AI while not getting \u201cdistracted\u201d by commercial pressures as investors have been quite demanding of the companies. **OpenAI Also Started as a Non-Profit AI Company** Incidentally, even OpenAI also started as a nonprofit but later became a for-profit company as it received billions of dollars in investments, including from Microsoft. Elon Musk \u2013 another OpenAI confounder \u2013 has criticized OpenAI for transforming from a non-profit companyto a \u201cmaximum profit\u201d company. He has good reason to be upset as he donated tens of millions of dollars before it shifted to a non-profit (meaning that he got absolutely nothing for his money). The billionaire has since disassociated himself from OpenAI and has started his own AI company X.ai which incidentally raised $6 billion late last month which gave the OpenAI competitor avaluation of a mammoth $24 billion. **Sutskever Backed Sam Altman\u2019s Sacking** Sutskever was among those who backed Sam Altman\u2019s sacking as OpenAI\u2019s CEO. This mistake quickly turned into a tornado of controversy and chaos as mostOpenAI employees threatened to quitif Altman wasn\u2019t reinstated. In just a few days, Altman was brought back as CEO and Sutskever apologized for participating in the board\u2019s action to remove him. However, his position at OpenAI apparently became untenable after the incident. Meanwhile, the timing of his departure raised eyebrows, as it came just a day afterOpenAI launched a new AI modelalong with a desktop version of ChatGPT. Now with Sutskever starting his own AI company, the competition could heat up as SSI seems to put \u201csafety\u201d and \u201csecurity\u201d as its USPs at a time when individuals, institutions, as well as governments are getting wary of the emerging technology.
