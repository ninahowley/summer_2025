But a Snap-Back Cometh** **by Wolf Richter \u2022May 30, 2025\u202256 Comments** **Outside of two heroes that pushed down the overall indices, there isn\u2019t anything benign about this PCE inflation data.** The PCE price index, released today by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, was benign. The overall PCE price index and the core PCE price index barely ticked up on a month-to-month basis, and on a year-over-year basis decelerated further toward the Fed\u2019s 2% target. And that\u2019s nice. But why? And the answer is not nice. Two very unusual things happened \u2013 one has never to that extent happened before in the data going back to 1960, and the other hasn\u2019t happened to that extent since the market crash in 2020 \u2013 which pushed down the core services PCE price index, the core PCE price index, and the overall PCE price index. What\u2019s not nice is that we know that those two components will snap back violently. The PCE (Personal Consumption Expenditure) price index tracks not only goods and services that are included in the CPI (Consumer Price Index), but also other categories that consumers don\u2019t pay for directly, such as many financial services, and it tracks many of the components not by observing transaction prices, but by \u201cimputing\u201d price levels from other data, including from financial markets. This PCE price index for \u201cfinancial services\u201dwith its \u201cimputed\u201d prices that consumers don\u2019t pay for directly was one of the two stars of the show today. The \u201cfinancial services\u201d PCE price index, which features heavily in core services, plunged month-to-month by 1.69% (-18.6% annualized) in April, by far the biggest drop since April 2020, when it plunged even more based on the values it imputed from the crash of the financial markets at the time. April 2025 experienced a big stock market sell-off, a five-day drop totaling 12.4% of the Wilshire 5000 index, though markets recovered afterwards. And the PCE price index with its imputed values went haywire \u2013 but we know that it won\u2019t last, that it will snap back violently: These are financial services many of which consumers don\u2019t pay for directly, and much of it is imputed from other data. \u201cFor example, the imputed value of banking services to deposit holders is calculated based on factors like interest rates and the volume of deposits,\u201d explains the BEA. It includes fees and commissions at banks, brokers, funds, portfolio management, etc. It includes \u201cfinancial services furnished without payments\u201d for which imputed values are used; it includes services provided by pension plans; commercial banks and credit unions; regulated investment companies; portfolio management and investment advice firms; trust, fiduciary, and custody activities, etc. Some of the sources from which values are imputed are FDIC data, PPI data, data from stock exchanges and markets \u2014 to impute the values for the components for portfolio management and investment advice services, for example \u2014 various government data, etc. And this financial services PCE price index is hugely volatile, some of it related to sharp movements in the financial markets, as in April 2020 and in April 2025. And it will snap back. The Fed knows all this, and Powell has occasionally mentioned the Financial Services component when it acts up in one or the other direction, and he might mention it again. Another hero: Recreation Services PCE price indexplunged month-to-month by 0.73% (-8.4% annualized), the biggest plunge in the entire history of the data going back to 1960. So this was another huge outlier. And it has nothing to do with foreigners not coming to the US suddenly, or whatever. Recreation services don\u2019t include lodging, airfares, etc. The index includes cable and satellite services, broadband, amusement parks, campgrounds, concerts, spectator sports, movies, theaters, gambling, video streaming, vet services, package tours, memberships, clubs, participant sports centers, museums, maintenance and repair of recreational and sports equipment. And we know it too will snap back, by just looking at this crazy chart of month-to-month changes: The Core Services PCE price indexwas pushed down substantially by these two heroes \u2013 Financial Services and Recreation Services: It rose by only 0.06% (+0.77% annualized) month-to-month in April, the smallest increase since April 2020, when, you guessed it, it had been pushed down even further by the Financial Services index due to the turmoil in the financial market at the time. However, the remaining core services categories showed significant inflation, except for \u201cOther services.\u201d Month-to-month annualized: Housing: +4.3% second highest since October Health care: +4.0% Transportation services: +9.3% Food services: +4.3% Insurance: +3.3% Non-energy utilities: +3.5% Other services: -0.8% So outside of those two heroes, there isn\u2019t anything benign about this inflation data. And it will snap back too because financial services and recreation services will snap back. The \u201cmarket-based PCE price index\u201d was not benign.The BEA also produces an alternative \u201cmarket based\u201d PCE price index that excludes most imputed data (except owners\u2019 equivalent of rent); and importantly, it excludes imputed components of financial services. It includes only prices that are based on actual transactions. This market-based services PCE price indexincreased month-to-month by 3.3% annualized, a slight deceleration from the prior month; and it increased year-over-year by 3.2%, a slight acceleration. The market-based core PCE Price indexrose by 3.1% annualized, a sharp acceleration. The six-month index accelerated to 2.5% annualized. And the year-over-year increase remained at 2.3%, roughly where it has been for the past four months: The snap-back cometh. Whatever inflation will do over the next couple of months, one thing we know: the PCE price index measures will include a snap-back from the plunge of the Financial Services index and the Recreation index. The Fed knows all this, obviously, and Powell occasionally mentioned the Financial Services component when it acted up in one or the other direction, and at the June FOMC meeting he might mention both, the plunge of the Financial Services index and the historic cliff-dive of the Recreation index, and might add a word or two about the coming snap-back of them.

I.e. the expense ratio my ETF charges me was a smaller amount because the value went down? Is that explanation at odds with an increase in the April Personal Savings Rate to 4.9%.And what explanation could we have for Recreational Services other than that consumers genuinely reduced their spending in this area? What reason do we have to think it will \u201csnap back\u201d other than reversion to the mean? Are we applying the same rationale to categories that snapped up in April and predicting they will revert to their means in May?Mostly, I\u2019m surprised goods inflation had not shown up yet by April. That was the height of the tariff war but apparently the higher costs did not show up yet. Who lost money selling inventory that could only be replaced at much higher prices? If anything snaps back, I suspect it will be the earnings of supply chain companies.Wolf Richtersays:May 30, 2025 at 2:51 pm\u201cSo financial services spending (imputed) declined\u2026\u201dThis is NOT \u201cspending\u201d data, this is INFLATION data (= rate of change of price levels).The fees and commissions by the \u201cportfolio management\u201d component and similar components are imputed from financial markets, and a market plunge causes the imputed level of those fees and commissions to plunge \u2013 even if consumers never pay those fees and commissions, and even if they actually never plunge.I didn\u2019t check what caused the prices in Recreation Services to plunge by the most ever. I\u2019m not really that interested in it. I don\u2019t think it matters. I know it will violently snap back next month or two.These kinds of issues are why the PCE price index is not really a consumer price index. The CPI serves that role well enough.

When beef gets too expensive and some consumers then buy pork instead, the PCE price index will lower the weight of beef in the basket and increase the weight of pork. The CPI doesn\u2019t do that.crazytownsays:May 31, 2025 at 9:41 amThat\u2019s interesting, Wolf.

The substitutions probably match reality of what consumers actually do in the face of rising prices (can\u2019t buy what you can\u2019t afford), but it\u2019s not a great way to set monetary policy. So financial services spending (imputed) declined because asset prices and/or consumer bank balances went down? I.e. the expense ratio my ETF charges me was a smaller amount because the value went down? Is that explanation at odds with an increase in the April Personal Savings Rate to 4.9%. And what explanation could we have for Recreational Services other than that consumers genuinely reduced their spending in this area? What reason do we have to think it will \u201csnap back\u201d other than reversion to the mean? Are we applying the same rationale to categories that snapped up in April and predicting they will revert to their means in May? Mostly, I\u2019m surprised goods inflation had not shown up yet by April. That was the height of the tariff war but apparently the higher costs did not show up yet. Who lost money selling inventory that could only be replaced at much higher prices? If anything snaps back, I suspect it will be the earnings of supply chain companies.

He was tough. He would walk up and down the aisles in class and drill us with questions. He would pick on the students randomly and drill them. You had be on your toes because you just knew he was going to pick you. If you screwed up, he would get pissed and move on to the next student. It was high pressure and humiliating if you messed up. Anyways, after two years of German, I had full filled the requirements for college so I was done. But, one of my friends continued on with German class. I saw him the next year and asked facetiously how German class was going. He said,\u201cOh it\u2019s wonderful!, Mr. Hoffman had a heart attack and now he has to take it easy. No more stress, no more pressure.\u201dI chuckled to my 17 year old self, but thought it was a shame. I really learned the material in his class. But, now he was forced to dial it back. @Wolf RichterThat reminds of a high school German teacher that I had. He was tough. He would walk up and down the aisles in class and drill us with questions.

So with $5 billion a month in Treasuries (new pace that started in April), that works about to be about $20 billion a month, in theory. But there is other stuff that happens that increases or decreases those amounts, and when they get larger, I usually discuss them in my balance sheet articles.In April, $14 billion in total rolled off.

Here is April, and I\u2019ll report on May next Thursday evening: https://wolfstreet.com/2025/05/01/fed-balance-sheet-qt-14-billion-in-april-2-26-trillion-from-peak-to-6-71-trillion-lowest-since-april-2020/ About $15 billion in MBS run off every month. So with $5 billion a month in Treasuries (new pace that started in April), that works about to be about $20 billion a month, in theory. But there is other stuff that happens that increases or decreases those amounts, and when they get larger, I usually discuss them in my balance sheet articles. In April, $14 billion in total rolled off. And the other stuff that had reduced that amount from $20 billion was: Discount Window borrowing increased by $1.3 billion, which increased the balance sheet by $1.3 billion. \u201cOther assets\u201d increased by $5 billion, mostly of accrued interest from its bond holdings that the Fed set up as a receivable (an asset) in April. When it receives that interest payment in May, the Fed destroys that money and it comes off the balance sheet, and the account declines by that amount.

But if FED starts selling MBS, it will put pressure on long term yields. It will further reduce demand for Treasury securities. Only higher yields can solve that demand problem. So if Treasury wants to sell more bonds, they have to pay higher rates. So this will be again put pressure on Debt levels which is Trump and Bessent trying to avoid.Is this correct understanding?Wolf Richtersays:May 30, 2025 at 11:51 pmYup.

It seems it will stabilize between 2.5%-2.9% staying indefinitely above the Fed\u2019s target, it has been stuck between this since MAY 2024 when the rate was at its highest 5.33. I assume moving forward the new target will be to keep it down below 3% or 2.5% and this will be our new normal, I just fear that if the FED cuts rates more that inflation will go up yet again, Powell\u2019s term ends May 2026 so it will be interesting to see if the inflation target moves from below 3% to something ridiculous like below 5%.Hoemersays:May 31, 2025 at 3:25 pmLooking back at the data I am completely puzzled WHY the Fed even cut rates in AUGUST 2024 when inflation was clearly not showing signs of going below 2%, the unemployment rate was also still very low at 4.2% so I do not buy that it was because of the unemployment rate! It seems very suspicious from the Fed especially cutting rates before election season, I am not accusing them of anything but I do not see any VALID reason why rates needed to keep being cut from August to January unless there were some cracks going on behind the scenes\u2026 However, Headline PCE was trending downward from May to September to 2.1%!! Seems that MIGHT be the explanation even if they tell us they use Core PCE\u2026but because of this mess the Fed is in a sticky situation!!! So much for being FORWARD-LOOKING!
