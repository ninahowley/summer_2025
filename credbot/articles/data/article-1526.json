They created and cultivated a culture where it was absolutely imperative to get it right and to show it as accurate and as authentic and as messy as possible,\u201d she says. Speaking with Variety\u2018s Artisans, presented by HBO, Ferreira explained that while the scenes begin in the writers\u2019 room, those eventually trickle down to the medical consultants whose job it is to bring that authenticity. \u201cWhen we were working through a scene with both the director and the cinematographer verbalizing what we\u2019re anticipating the actresses or actors to do in that moment on what cued line, allows the DP to plan her shots and do her blocking so that way those very sensitive moments or emotional moments can be captured with the action of the medicine at the same time.\u201dRelated StoriesNITO\u2019s Nathaniel Marro on Solutions for the Broken Ticketing Business: \u2018The Harder You Make It to Buy Tickets, the Fewer You Will Sell'Zoe Salda\u00f1a Says Her Oscar Statue Is 'Trans' and 'Goes by They/Them' Pronouns: 'We Have It in My Office and My Oscar Is Gender Fluid' **Related Stories** **NITO\u2019s Nathaniel Marro on Solutions for the Broken Ticketing Business: \u2018The Harder You Make It to Buy Tickets, the Fewer You Will Sell'** **Zoe Salda\u00f1a Says Her Oscar Statue Is 'Trans' and 'Goes by They/Them' Pronouns: 'We Have It in My Office and My Oscar Is Gender Fluid'** **Related Stories** **NITO\u2019s Nathaniel Marro on Solutions for the Broken Ticketing Business: \u2018The Harder You Make It to Buy Tickets, the Fewer You Will Sell'** **Zoe Salda\u00f1a Says Her Oscar Statue Is 'Trans' and 'Goes by They/Them' Pronouns: 'We Have It in My Office and My Oscar Is Gender Fluid'** As a medical consultant on the show, another major part of her role is working with the cast. The show, which is set in real time, with 15 episodes covering a 15-hour workday, features over 300 background extras as well as its principals, Noah Wyle, Tracy Ifeachor, Patrick Ball, Katherine LaNasa, Taylor Dearden and Isa Briones. \u201cIt\u2019s really the rehearsal and the education and teaching them the finesse and the refined movements.\u201d By the end, the cast has natural movements as they intubate, put a cast on, or an IV. She also works with them on the technical jargon that again helps them speak with ease and emotion.\u201d While there are countless medical emergencies throughout the day on the show, Ferreira reveals the scene that stuck most to real-life was in episode 4 when an older patient has multifocal pneumonia and sepsis. Ferreira says, \u201cYou see the struggle of what intubation looks like. The general audience learns what intubation looks like. And then going through the process of transitioning to comfort care to allow there to be dignity in death is actually one of the most common conversations we have both in the emergency medicine setting and the hospital and critical care unit.\u201d She goes on to say, \u201cI think it\u2019s actually a really great educational moment to let people see that sometimes there is dignity in death. It\u2019s a bit disturbing, but it gets all of it in one beautiful moment.\u201d In another episode, an influencer gets mercury poisoning from makeup. How accurate is that? Ferreira says, \u201cMercury poisoning is, I wouldn\u2019t say rare, but not as common. We do see a lot of toxicities from various household chemicals, various makeup products, or just exposures to general environmental things quite often.\u201d The attack on Dana by a frustrated patient in episode 9 is something that reflects violence towards doctors and healthcare workers. But Ferreira clarifies, \u201cI think the inspiration behind showing Dana get punched is one, there is an actual level of violence in the emergency department. I never call the ER a glamorous place. And it\u2019s because we\u2019re seeing all walks of life. We do not discriminate. So, whether it\u2019s patients who are unfortunately under the influence of various drugs, if they have underlying psychiatric disorders, if they\u2019ve gone through a very traumatic moment and coping mechanisms are not in place for them to tolerate any bad news.\u201d She continues, \u201cSometimes it can be projected onto the healthcare worker who is either providing the bad news or somehow the system is failing the healthcare worker, which then fails the patient. And Dana is the perfect character to have this happen to because you see someone who\u2019s been trying the entire season to move the department along, to get patients seen, to try her best to take care of not just the patients but her staff and acts as this mama bear to everyone.\u201d Watch the video above.
