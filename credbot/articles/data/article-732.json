Kim Reynolds on Wednesday rejecteda billthat could have introduced more complications for a massivecarbon-capture pipelineproject routed across several Midwestern states, issuing a rare veto in the Republican-controlled statehouse.The legislation was designed by Iowa House Republicans to increase regulations of Summit Carbon Solutions\u2019 estimated $8.9 billion, 2,500-mile (4,023-kilometer) project that cuts across Iowa and already has anapproved permitin the state.But the bill provoked loud opposition from members of Iowa\u2019s powerful ethanol industry, which argued the project is essential for Iowa\u2019s agricultural dominance, for farmers and for construction jobs. And it exposed a rift within the party over how to protect property rights.\u201cWhile I shared the bill\u2019s goal of protecting landowners, good policy should draw clear, careful lines. This bill doesn\u2019t,\u201d said Reynolds, a Republican, in the explanation of her veto. \u201cIt combines valid concerns with vague legal standards and sweeping mandates that reach far beyond their intended targets.\u201dEven with the relief from Reynolds\u2019 veto, Summit will likely have toreadjust plansafter South Dakota\u2019s governorsigned a banon the use of eminent domain \u2014 the government seizure of private property with compensation \u2014 to acquire land for carbon dioxide pipelines. Summit\u2019s permit application was also rejected inSouth Dakota.The project has permit approvals in Iowa, Minnesota andNorth Dakotabut faces various court challenges.The Iowa bill would have prohibited the renewal of permits for a carbon dioxide pipeline, limited the use of such a pipeline to 25 years and significantly increased the insurance coverage requirements for the pipeline company.Those provisions would likely have made it less financially feasible for a company to build a carbon dioxide pipeline.Despite her veto, Reynolds said she was \u201ccommitted to working with the legislature to strengthen landowner protections, modernize permitting, and respect private property.\u201dAs the legislative session wound down, a dozen Republican senators insisted their leaders bring the House-approved bill to the floor for a vote after several years of inaction. The stalemate ended in a long and divisive debate among the Iowa Senate\u2019s Republican supermajority, with senators openly criticizing one another and exposing the closed-door discussions that got them there.The pipeline\u2019s many critics have for years begged lawmakers for action. They accuse Summit of stepping on their property rights and downplaying the safety risks of building the pipeline alongside family homes, near schools and across ranches.Lee Enterprises and The Associated Pressreviewed hundreds of casesthat reveal the great legal lengths the company went to to get the project built. In South Dakota, in particular, a slew of eminent domain legal actions to obtain land sparked a groundswell of opposition that was closely watched by lawmakers in Iowa as well.But as debate in the state Senate seemed inevitable, dozens of Summit employees and leaders and members of the Iowa Corn Growers Association, the Iowa Renewable Fuels Association and labor unions made a big showing as well.The pipeline was proposed to carry carbon emissions from ethanol plants in Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, North Dakota and South Dakota to be stored underground permanentlyin North Dakota.By lowering carbon emissions from the plants, the pipeline would lower their carbon intensity scores and make them more competitive in therenewable fuels market.The project would also allow ethanol producers and Summit to tap intofederal tax credits.Iowa Renewable Fuels Association Executive Director Monte Shaw immediately issued a statement Wednesday praising Reynolds\u2019 veto.
