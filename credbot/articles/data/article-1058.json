The action, announced Friday, strikes at the financial and logistical infrastructure underpinning Iran\u2019s shadow energy trade\u2014particularly its crude exports to Asia. At the center of the designations is Nasser Zarrin Ghalam and Partners Company, based in Tehran, which U.S. authorities say orchestrates illicit petroleum transactions through a web of front companies. Dozens of these entities are registered in Hong Kong, the United Arab Emirates, and Iran, often using aliases and shell addresses to obscure Iranian origins and enable oil shipments through falsified documentation. Two UAE-based firms\u2014ACE Petrochem FZE and Moderate General Trading LLC\u2014were sanctioned for their direct links to the National Iranian Tanker Company (NITC), a blacklisted entity central to Iran\u2019s crude oil export apparatus. Both firms are alleged to facilitate crude transport and payments through maritime and financial routes designed to evade detection. Another key entity, Kimia Sadr Pasargad Company, headquartered in Tehran, was identified as a critical player in Iran\u2019s petrochemical export sector. It, too, now faces secondary sanctions, cutting it off from dollar-based transactions and threatening foreign partners with penalties. Hong Kong served as the financial nerve center for much of the operation. Shell companies such as PrettyAndy Trading Limited (a.k.a. Ragang Petroleum and Logistics Co.) and Golden Pen General Trading LLC were cited for their role in laundering proceeds and masking cargo origins. Friday\u2019s move signals Washington\u2019s intent to tighten the noose on Iran\u2019s sanctioned oil flows at a time when Tehran is reportedly increasing exports to China and other Asian buyers via intermediaries. With global oil markets tightening and enforcement fatigue rising, the U.S. appears determined to disrupt Iran\u2019s energy workaround networks\u2014especially those with reach into major Asian trading hubs.
