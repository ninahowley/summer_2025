Fundamental analysis of a stock involves looking at a company\u2019s underlying business metrics, such as its revenue, earnings and debt. Technical analysis, on the other hand, involves looking only at a stock\u2019s recent price movements and identifying buy and sell signals in its chart. What is Technical Analysis? How Does Technical Analysis Work? Technical Analysis vs. Fundamental Analysis See All6Items **What is Technical Analysis?** While it may seem counterintuitive, technical analysts don\u2019t typically care about what product or service a company sells or anything else about the company\u2019s business. Instead, technical analysts are only interested in two things: stock price and volume. Technical analysts look for patterns in a stock\u2019s chart that signal where its share price could be headed next. Modern technical analysis dates back to Charles Dow in the late 1800s. In a nutshell, the Dow Theory identified a series of higher highs and higher lows in a stock chart as an uptrend. Likewise, stocks making a series of lower highs and lower lows are considered to be in a downtrend. The idea that a trader can look at a pattern of past price performance and predict that pattern will continue is the basis of TA. **How Does Technical Analysis Work?** Fundamental analysts often criticize TA as a sort of mysticism or pseudoscience. After all, the idea that stock charts hold some sort of predictive power may not make sense on the surface. First, many technical analysts would say thepatternstraders identify in charts aren\u2019t directly influencing the future stock price. Instead, they merely represent a visual representation of a pattern of underlying market activity that actually is directly influencing future share price. For example, shifts in investor sentiment often manifest as a particular pattern in astock\u2019s chart, such as a head-and-shoulders formation. The head-and-shoulders formation doesn\u2019t have magical power over the stock price. It is merely a visual representation that a majority of traders have flipped from bullish to bearish. In addition, TA can become a self-fulfilling prophecy. If enough traders recognize a particular pattern as bearish, they will sell or short the stock when they see it. That belief alone can create enough selling pressure to move a stock lower. **Technical Analysis vs. Fundamental Analysis** Technical analysis relies on historical price patterns and trading volumes to forecast future price movements. Analysts use charts and technical indicators, such as moving averages and Relative Strength Index (RSI), to identify trends and potential entry or exit points. For example, a trader may observe that a stock has consistently rallied after reaching its 50-day moving average, leading them to enter a long position when the price approaches this level again. On the other hand, fundamental analysis seeks to determine the intrinsic value of an asset based on economic indicators, financial statements and broader industry trends. Investors look at a company\u2019s earnings, revenue growth, debt levels and other key performance indicators to assess whether a stock is overvalued or undervalued. For example, if a company has aPrice-to-Earnings(P/E) ratio of 15, while the industry average is 20, an investor might conclude that the stock is undervalued and consider it a good buying opportunity. **TA Strategies For Beginners** One popular TA trading strategy is themoving average crossoverstrategy. Traders typically buy a stock when its 50-day simple moving average crosses above its 200-day simple moving average. They then sell or short the stock when the 50-day SMA drops back below the 200-day SMA. Another common TA trading strategy involves therelative strength index. RSI is a measure of short-term momentum that varies from zero to 100. RSI traders typically sell or short \u201coverbought\u201d stocks when RSI is above 70 and buy \u201coversold\u201d stocks when the RSI drops below 30. TA traders also look for historicallybullish patternsandbearish patternsin stock charts that serve as signals of when to buy or sell a stock. Head-and-shoulders, flags, wedges, cup-and-handles and double/triple tops and bottoms are common examples of these patterns. **Benzinga\u2019s Take** Most technical analysts will tell beginners that TA works if it is used properly and safely. However, no trading system is 100% perfect, and TA is certainly not a path to getting rich quick in the market. **Frequently Asked Questions** **How do technical analysts use volume in their analysis?** Volume refers to the number of shares or contracts traded in a security or market. Technical analysts use volume to confirm trends, as increasing volume often indicates a stronger price movement. **Can technical analysis be applied to any market?** Yes, technical analysis can be applied to various markets including stocks, commodities, forex, and cryptocurrencies, as long as there is a historical price and volume data available. **How reliable is technical analysis?** The reliability of technical analysis can vary depending on market conditions and the skill of the analyst. It is not foolproof, but when combined with risk management strategies, it can be an effective trading tool. **Is it possible to combine technical analysis with other strategies?** Yes, many traders and investors combine technical analysis with fundamental analysis or other strategies such as sentiment analysis or quantitative approaches to enhance their trading decisions. **What is the importance of backtesting in technical analysis?** Backtesting involves applying a trading strategy to historical data to evaluate its effectiveness. This allows analysts to refine their strategies and understand their potential performance before applying them in live markets. **Connect With Us** **About Benzinga** About Us Careers Advertise Contact Us **Market Resources** Advanced Stock Screener Tools Options Trading Chain Analysis Comprehensive Earnings Calendar Dividend Investor Calendar and Alerts Economic Calendar and Market Events IPO Calendar and New Listings Market Outlook and Analysis Wall Street Analyst Ratings and Targets **Trading Tools & Education** Benzinga Pro Trading Platform Options Trading Strategies and News Stock Market Trading Ideas and Analysis Technical Analysis Charts and Indicators Fundamental Analysis and Valuation Day Trading Guides and Strategies Live Investors Events Pre market Stock Analysis and News Cryptocurrency Market Analysis and News **Ring the Bell** A newsletter built for market enthusiasts by market enthusiasts.
