But there are specific rules binding class actions, known as Rule 23 in the federal rules for civil procedures. The Legal Information Institute lays out what the court must find in order to approve a class action: The number of class members renders it impracticable to join them in the action The class members\u2019 claims share common questions of law or fact The claims or defenses of the proposed class representatives are typical of those for the rest of the class, and The proposed class representatives will adequately protect the interests of the entire class. In short, multiple plaintiffs must all have sufficiently similar claims of damage, such that a ruling would largely have the same affect on all class members. The question is then before the court: have all these plaintiffs indeed suffered similar harm from the defendant? **How Long Do Class Action Lawsuits Take** Again, the answer is: it depends on the case. In some cases, the answer is 10 minutes! Defendants can try to end the case before it even begins by settling with the plaintiffs \u2013 typically this means payments. According to Top Class Actions,settlements can typicallytake up to nine months or a year. However, if class actions go to trial, the timeline becomes years long \u2013 typically two or three years, according to the Cochran Firm.
