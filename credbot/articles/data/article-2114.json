Nevertheless, the rioters kept proceeding with the arson, the rock throwing, and the Molotov cocktail hurling, though ultimately it resulted in some of them getting identified and with their images beingplasteredon \"most wanted\" posters by the DOJ, while some of the other criminal illegals who allegedly participated in the chaos and violence have been arrested and charged with attempted murder.

Some of\u2026pic.twitter.com/CwiYRj2weT Incredibly, advocates for illegal immigrants were trying to suggest that some of the ones nabbed shouldn't have been arrested... ICE's \"public safety\" narrative often collapses after scrutiny:The guy on the left was a prison firefighter, a job not available to safety threats. He was granted bond from ICE detention in 2022.Similarly, the man on the right was paroled by CA in 2022 for good behavior.https://t.co/1mDzDdlZhjpic.twitter.com/kgeqeZNmCb ...which prompted this response from Melugin: You can\u2019t be serious? The guy on the right is a convicted murderer & the guy on the left has convictions for shooting into an occupied house, willful child cruelty, DUI, assault with a firearm, & has had a deportation order since 2020.Youre saying ICE should *NOT* arrest them?https://t.co/P9K4Ma6lZs On Monday, Bill Essayli, U.S. Attorney for the Central District of California,confirmedwith Fox News that immigration enforcement effortswould not beslowing down and that the riots had, in fact, galvanized federal law enforcement to press on: He said absolutely not - and that the riots will have the opposite effect, leading to more military and federal resources being sent into LA. Nothing will stop their federal immigration operations, he said. It's something Essayli reiterated during an interview with \"Ingraham Angle\" host Laura Ingraham on Tuesday: If you do the crime, you\u2019ll do the time.
