As part of Yamaha Agriculture\u2019s launch, the company acquired Robotics Plus and The Yield.Robotics Plusis a New Zealand-based agritech company that specializes in the design and build of robotics, AI, and autonomous machines that reduce reliance on labor and provide data-driven insights for growers. The Yield is a precision yield management company focused on specialty crops that claims to transform precision agriculture practices and outcomes through scalable, AI-based technologies. \u201cWe believe meaningful innovation in agriculture emerges through close collaboration with growers and industry partners,\u201dNolan Paul, CEO of Yamaha Agriculture said. \u201cThe capabilities of Robotics Plus in robotics and automation and The Yield in AI-powered analytics represent two important building blocks in addressing these challenges.\u201d **Western Growers Association Welcomes New Company** Walt Duflock, senior vice president of innovation at the Western Growers Association (WGA), said his team \u201cwill be working with the Yamaha Agriculture team to try and get the products from Robotics Plus and The Yield vetted and in trials and case studies with our members.\u201d Increasing labor costs are one of the reasons that WGA is so focused on automation, Duflock said WGA and Cal Poly Professor Lynn Hamilton worked together on research regarding the labor inputs for selected specialty crops. \u201cCalifornia farmers spent $16.3 billion on 850 million hours of farm labor in 2023,\u201d Duflock said. \u201cRoughly two-thirds of those hours are on harvesting crops; the other one-third are for non-harvest activities (weeding, thinning, planting, spraying).\u201d As a result, Duflock said, \u201cit\u2019s good for the space that Yamaha is taking startup investments and launching a platform to help them get traction in the U.S. and other specialty crop markets.\u201d Yamaha\u2019s involvement in improving automations in the specialty crop industry \u201chelps increase the chances that Robotics Plus, The Yield, and any other acquisitions have a better shot at having adequate capital to get to scale,\u201d Duflock said. **Specialty Growers Share Excitement for Yamaha Agriculture** Jeff Cleveringa, the head of orchard operations at Columbia Fruit Packers in Wenatchee, Washington, said automation is a relatively new aspect of the specialty crop industry. \u201cThe industrial revolution left us behind,\u201d Cleveringa said. \u201cWe got the tractor and that was it.\u201d Now, though, Cleveringa said it\u2019s an exciting time to explore automations in the specialty crop industry. He said Yamaha\u2019s involvement in automation is \u201cthe missing link in specialty crops.\u201d This is because an industry partner like Yamaha Agriculture brings the ability to scale automation tools for the industry as a whole, Cleveringa said. **Automation Tools Bring Many Wins for Specialty Crops** On the farms that Columbia Fruit Packers manages, Cleveringa said they invested in Robotics Plus\u2019 Prospr machines in 2024. Prospr is an autonomous, multi-purpose hybrid vehicle designed to perform a range of orchard and vineyard tasks. It was built to tackle labor shortages and is capable of multiple activities including spraying and weed control, with additional attachments such as mowing in development. Cleveringa said Columbia Fruit Packers decided to invest in Prospr because \u201cit\u2019s a modular system so we can add other attachments.\u201d The Prospr machines have helped the team at Columbia Fruit Packers with spraying their orchards with \u201ca lot of cost savings in diesel fuel burn,\u201d Cleveringa said. The investment into Prospr has been a win-win for his operation, Cleveringa said, not only from a cost-savings standpoint, but also regarding environmental and worker safety concerns. **Yamaha Agriculture\u2019s Involvement Can Get Tools to Growers** Overall, Cleveringa said he\u2019s excited that Yamaha Agriculture can bring the tools Robotics Plus needs to get Prospr into the hands of the growers. \u201cWe hope that this is just the first step for Yamaha Agriculture,\u201d Cleveringa said, \u201cand that they will continue with other companies. We hope this is the first step to work together to identify pain points and opportunities [for the industry].\u201d Yamaha **Data-Driven Approach to Solve Labor Shortage Concerns** Matt Miles, the process improvement manager at Allen Brothers Fruit in Naches, Washington, said \u201cYamaha is going to be a great partner. I\u2019m excited about collaborating with them.\u201d One of the reasons that Miles said he\u2019s so excited about the financial backing Yamaha Agriculture brings to companies like The Yield, a company his team at Allen Brothers Fruit has been working closely with to develop data-driven automations, is because there\u2019s a massive labor shortage impacting specialty crop growers. \u201cPeople used to want to do this work,\u201d Miles said. \u201cThere\u2019s a big disconnect between the folks that want to do the work and the work that needs to be done. We\u2019ve been reliant on a low-cost and available work force.\u201d Automations will not only ease labor dynamics, Miles said, but they\u2019ll allow companies like Allen Brothers Fruit to make the jobs of the people in the fields and packhouses easier \u201cso we can maintain or increase productivity.\u201d **Related Articles** **Follow Us** News Markets Machinery Crops Farm Management Livestock Family About Us Subscribe Editorial Process Advertise Privacy Policy Careers Terms of Service Contact Us Your Privacy Choices"}
