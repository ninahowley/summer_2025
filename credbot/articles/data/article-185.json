About Us Take Action News and Analysis **Joining Golden Dome Would Be a \u201cMonumental Betrayal,\u201d Say Anti-War Groups** byCouncil of Canadians June 11, 2025June 11, 2025 Media Council of Canadians, World Beyond War Call on Carney to Reject \u201cDangerous, Costly\u201d Scheme OTTAWA \u2013The Council of Canadians, World Beyond War and allies are calling on Prime Minister Mark Carney to reject any Canadian participation in U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s recently announced \u201cGolden Dome\u201d project. Canada could join the missile interceptor programme as part of the trade and security pact the Carney government is currently negotiating with the US Talks between the two countries are moving rapidly, with some media reports suggesting a deal could be announced in the coming days. Nikolas Barry-Shaw, trade and privatization campaigner,Council of Canadians:\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t even be considering signing up for the Golden Dome. We\u2019ve seen this movie before, and we know how it ends. This latest \u2018Star Wars\u2019 reboot will cost Canadians tens if not hundreds of billions of dollars, inflame international tensions and lead to the militarization of space. It will make American arms manufacturers richer, but it will not make Canadians any safer.\u201d \u201cCorporate Canada may think joining Trump\u2019s Golden Dome is a good idea, but most Canadians do not. Polls show ordinary Canadians remain overwhelmingly opposed to putting anti-missile weapon systems in space, with good reason. If Mark Carney signs us up for Trump\u2019s Golden Dome, it would be a monumental betrayal of the trust Canadians have placed in him.\u201d Rachel Small, Canada lead,World Beyond War:\u201cIt is unthinkable that Canada would partner on a new hundreds of billions of dollars project with the US at the same moment that President Donald Trump is deploying economic aggression and annexationist threats against Canada. Let alone a project that will antagonize military powers around the world while sparking a race to militarize space.\u201d \u201cSpending hundreds of billions of dollars on outrageous and aggressive weapons systems like the Golden Dome is a slap in the face to everyone in Canada struggling to get by or to imagine a life for their children in a country that sets new wildfire records nearly every year.\u201d \u201cIf ever there were a time to reassess the genuine threats to the security of people across Canada and separate them from the self-interested goals of Donald Trump or the American weapons industry, this is it.\u201d **Quotes from allies** \u201cParticipating in Trump\u2019s Golden Dome is a betrayal of Mark Carney\u2019s promise to distance Canada from the US,\u201d explainedCanadian Foreign Policy InstitutefellowTamara Lorincz. \u201cCanada must oppose weaponizing space and escalating the arms race.\u201d \u201cDuring the election campaign, the Liberals promised to distance Canada from the US military\u201d, saysKaren RodmanfromJust Peace Advocates. \u201cJoining the Golden Dome would betray that promise. Canada shouldn\u2019t participate in Trump\u2019s Golden Dome.\u201d **BACKGROUND** Canadians oppose paying Trump to join the Golden Dome by a margin of nearly 4-to-1 (63% against, versus 17% for Canadians participation), according toa Nanos poll, conducted June 1-3. Last week, the Toronto Sunreportedthat the Carney government\u2019s discussions over a trade and security pact with the U.S. \u201chave recently intensified with the hope of announcing a deal within the next week to 10 days.\u201d \u201cWhat we can expect is an announcement that Canada will increase its defence spending, including potential participation in the Golden Dome missile defence system.\u201d The U.S. has spent more than $350 billion on anti-missile systems over the past 60 years, with few tangible results to show for it. Experts and scientists havecriticized the Golden Dome initiativeas \u201ca fantasy,\u201d \u201ca mirage,\u201d and \u201cscience fiction.\u201d \u2013 30 \u2013 MEDIA CONTACTS:Nikolas Barry-Shaw(Council of Canadians),nbarryshaw@canadians.org, 514-825-2263Rachel Small(World Beyond War Canada),rachel@worldbeyondwar.org, 647-769-2472 **aBOUT uS** Since 1985, theCouncil of Canadianshas organized across the country to challenge corporate power and advocate for people, the planet, and democracy.
