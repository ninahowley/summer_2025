JULIET, Tenn. (WTVF) \u2014 What parents saw from their cars had many of them struggling to find words as they lined up outside W.A. Wright Elementary on the last day of school. This was for many of them the first time they had seen images of the black sludge creeping down the walls of the school kitchen. \u201cI\u2019m shocked. I can\u2019t. This school? I\u2019m having a hard time,\u201d Lindsey Vazquez said. \u201cIt\u2019s nasty, whatever it is,\u201d Jodee Stocki said. NewsChannel5 Investigatesobtained video and photos from inside the school showing the sludge build-up on kitchen walls, on the floor, and in the cooler. We shared this with parents who were left trying to make sense of how long this substance was on the walls and if their children were somehow impacted. \u201cWell, that makes me uneasy. My daughter has lunch here almost every day,\u201d Kourtney Hurst said. Shannel Saddler has worked in the kitchen for the past few months but says she\u2019s felt sick practically every day since. We met with Saddler on the last day of school, hours after she said she was told to leave for speaking up. \u201cIt\u2019s bad. It\u2019s bad. That\u2019s why a lot of the children have been sick. It\u2019s not just allergies,\u201d Saddler said. She told us her team met with an administrator and that\u2019s when Saddler explained her concerns. \u201cShe got angry, walked toward me, put her finger in my face, and told me to leave,\u201d Saddler said. Saddler says she walked out knowing that speaking up meant risking her job. That hasn\u2019t stopped her from sharing what she\u2019s since learned has been dripping down these walls for years. \u201cIt\u2019s in the vents, they\u2019re breathing it in. It\u2019s in the cafeteria where the kids eat. It would be on the food, but I would remove it and throw it in the trash,\u201d Saddler said. NewsChannel5 Investigatesdiscovered that the last three inspection reports from the Tennessee Department of Health show W.A. Wright Elementary School\u2019s kitchen received 98s and 99s out of 100 dating back to February 2024. All three reports mention a brown or black substance in some cases dripping from the ceiling and onto yogurt and canned drinks. The report doesn\u2019t explain what this substance could be and never requested a follow-up investigation. \u201cI\u2019m afraid that it will not be fixed and that the kids will constantly be sick from it. That\u2019s what I\u2019m afraid of,\u201d Saddler said through tears. \u201cYou didn\u2019t get into this business to make kids sick,\u201d we asked. \u201cNo,\u201d Saddler replied. Bart Barker, the public information officer for Wilson County Schools, said that while the project to fix roof issues at the school is long overdue, it will be completed. \u201cOne of the issues we\u2019ve faced since then is that other schools in the district have had equally as pressing or other dire needs that match this or are in worse condition. This year is when the approval came for the funds to really get on the roof situation. It\u2019s no secret, it (W.A. Wright Elementary) has had its issues for multiple years,\u201d Barker said. Barker says other more recent projects include a new roof for Lakeview Elementary, major interior repairs and a new HVAC system for Mt. Juliet Middle, as well as new HVAC systems at Gladeville Elementary and Carroll Oakland Elementary. He said roofers began work at W.A. Wright Elementary in the past few weeks, so they've since taped off the kitchen and dining rooms. Several students are expected to return to summer school beginning this week, but Barker says they will all be fed out of the nearby Green Hills High School. Barker says they\u2019ve ordered air quality tests for W.A. Wright, but he\u2019s seen the videos and understands why parents are concerned. \u201cFrom a photogenic standpoint, it looks awful,\u201d Barker said. Barker, however, said they haven\u2019t seen any more sick kids or staff than normal. He says the district consulted with The Garland Company and they concluded that the substance is, \u201cremnants of roofing material, tar/stains/oils that\u2019s applied to roofs such as this, along with asphalt sheeting/insulation materials.\u201d Barker said much of what we see is a byproduct of one of the wettest starts to the year we\u2019ve had in years. Once water collects on the roof, Barker said it\u2019s only inevitable for it to make its way through the roof of this aging school. \u201cKnowing that this has been going on for years, why has it not risen to the level of letting parents know what\u2019s going on?\u201d we asked. \u201cIf we felt there was a crisis involving this school and children\u2019s health, then absolutely there would have been communication, but at no point have we felt like that,\u201d Barker said. \u201cOne of the inspection reports mentions that whatever was leaking from the ceiling was falling on yogurt and soda cans. That to me presents an issue of contamination,\u201d we responded. \u201cIf there were things that were penetrated because of leakage, they were discarded,\u201d Barker said. Saddler said she and her team felt pressure at times not to throw away food because it costs money to replace it. Barker said not only does he believe that wasn\u2019t the case, but he also rejects the notion that Saddler was fired for speaking up. \u201cNot only is she still an employee as I had stated, but multiple waves of communication from the district were sent to her last week via her then and still active district email address to offer support and state clearly that she had not been terminated,\u201d Barker said. He said his wish would be for more employees to feel empowered about speaking up if they spot problems of their own. \u201cExercise the open-door policy. Come talk before a school board meeting. Express your concerns and your views. That\u2019s encouraged. I don\u2019t know what the disconnect is and why that didn\u2019t happen,\u201d Barker said. Saddler says she has no intentions of returning, but says that was never really the priority. She wants parents to know what\u2019s happening and feels relying on a short-term fix will not solve long-term problems. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to think about the children. That\u2019s it. I don\u2019t care about anything else, but that. That\u2019s why I put my job at risk,\u201d Saddler said. Barker said they expect to have air quality test results at some point this summer and promise to provide those findings as soon as possible.
