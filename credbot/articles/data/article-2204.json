Momoa and Bonet had been together for over 16 years, but didn\u2019t marry until 2017. The couple announced an amicable split on social media which immediately was picked up by the AP, but nobody thought they\u2019d see Momoa out with anyone new quite so soon. Davidson, who has been romantically linked to nearly every woman on the planet, most recently Kim Kardashian, has reportedly swooped in quickly to get in on Momoa\u2019s hunky, manly body. \u201cThe dude is fucking awesome inAquaman,\u201d Davidson told a reporter for TMZ. \u201cI\u2019ve never felt super into dudes, but one look at Jason with his shirt off throughout the entire runtime of that movie, and I challenge any man not to get erect. It\u2019s just not possible.\u201d Davidson is known for his whirlwind relationships, and friends of Momoa are already concerned for his well-being. \u201cJason is one big, badass dude,\u201d said friend Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, who recently starred in the epic film DUNE with Momoa. \u201cNobody is saying that Jason can\u2019t take care of himself, but on the inside he\u2019s a big soft teddy bear, and I just hope that Pete doesn\u2019t screw around with his feelings.\u201d Momoa and his reps could not be reached for comment. According to sources, his ex Lisa Bonet \u2013 best known for her role as Denise Huxtable onThe Cosby Show\u2013 is \u201ccompletely broken up\u201d about Momoa being seen out so soon with someone new. \u201cShe knew he\u2019d eventually start seeing someone else, but didn\u2019t know it would be this fast,\u201d said a friend of Bonet\u2019s who asked to remain anonymous. \u201cI mean, Jason could have any woman on this planet, and Lisa knows that. Hell, God knows I\u2019ve jilled-off to thoughts of him before. So Lisa expected someone to come along eventually, but I think we\u2019re all surprised that it\u2019s Pete Fucking Davidson.\u201d **Comments** comments About / Disclaimer Privacy Policy Terms and conditions Feed Copyright \u00a9 2025Empire News LLC Design & Developed ByOpen Source Technologies."}
