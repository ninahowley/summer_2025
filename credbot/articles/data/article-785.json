But now that\u2019s about to change. Reese is leaving her role as tribal administrator. She\u2019ll be moving to Juneau to serve as the Chief Operating Officer for the Tlingit and Haida Regional Housing Authority. She said she will end her current position and start her new one in mid-June. KSTK\u2019s Colette Czarnecki talked with Reese about her life \u2013 as it was and what\u2019s to come. The author lightly edited the interviews for brevity and clarity. It\u2019s this entire mix of emotions. I am feeling very proud of all of the work that the WCA staff and council and I have done over the past years. I\u2019ve lived in Wrangell for 22 years now, and I\u2019ve been with the tribe for 13. But in the mix of that is excitement, because I\u2019m going to be working in something that studies have shown as the most needed sector in Alaska, which is housing. Also really honored to have the opportunity to have the president and CEO of the Regional Housing Authority as a mentor, and that\u2019s Jackie Pata. I oversee all of the departments within the tribe. So Transportation, Earth Branch, Tourism, and we\u2019ve got a whole bunch of different departments and a bunch of different projects. This position is a multifaceted one that requires a lot of different skills. You sort of do a little bit of everything. You\u2019re serving as the liaison between the tribal council and the local clans. We\u2019re one of the few tribes that actually work hand in hand with our clans. And that\u2019s a really important part of the job. The first thing, actually, that comes to mind is looking at a problem and figuring out how to creatively come up with a solution. Not only have it be impactful for Wrangell, but have it be impactful across the state and across the nation. There had been a lot of historic things that have happened in the last year. We were able to change some of the ways the federal government helps people when there are natural disasters. Because of our work through FEMA, our traditional subsistence foods are now covered. We created a precedent throughout the whole nation. And food security is so important. When you\u2019re a small tribe, you have to be creative. I worked as a financial advisor and a business manager for First Union Securities. I specialized in financial planning for women, which was important to me, because at the time, it was sort of a something that wasn\u2019t well understood by the demographic that I was working with and to just see them light up and get excited about something that they felt was intimidating, was really meaningful. I worked for the state as a retirement and benefits specialist, and then worked in a family business with salmon restoration. And then started with the tribe, first as a transportation planner. When I came back to Wrangell from living on the East Coast, I really realized that our people have such a rich tradition, and there\u2019s so much that\u2019s needed. how can we revitalize our culture, how can we save our languages and our stories? How can we teach our children and how can we do that in a way that\u2019s meaningful and impactful, so that we can literally show the whole world what it means to live in balance and to have reciprocity and walk gently on the earth? And that, to me, was just really inspiring. If I can end my life having even helped a little bit with that, I will feel like it\u2019s a life well lived. So the Tlingit and Haida Regional Housing Authority is the tribally designated housing authority for Southeast Alaska, and they manage funding for housing for all of our tribal citizens. I have so many ideas to do with that, but it\u2019s basically like the vice president position. The Housing Authority does so much. They are growing. They\u2019re developing. They have mastered the model that we\u2019re doing here in Wrangell where you use multiple funding sources to really reach your ultimate goals. They\u2019ve saved people so much money with tax preparation. They have financial literacy classes so I can, once again, do my financial planning for women. I have so many near and dear memories. I mean, I\u2019ll probably start crying if I talk about too many of them. One that comes to mind is the carving shed was built 10 years ago for totem carving and to see that first huge log being rolled into that carving shed, and seeing it being used for the purpose for which it was built, and seeing our first totem project here in 37 years, we\u2019ll have our first totem raising in 38 years in July, and to realize that I was able to be here and be a part of that history. It\u2019s been an honor to be here to work with everybody within the whole community, the Forest Service, the city, all of the wonderful partnerships that we\u2019ve put into place, they\u2019re just memories I\u2019ll take with me for the rest of my life. So yeah, gunalch\u00e9esh for the honor. It\u2019s been absolutely wonderful.
