The report reveals how language and access to resources related to or intended for LGBTQ users on federal government websites have changed since President Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s inauguration. We are able to compare each webpage now to what it looked like in previous administrations thanks to the wonderful work of the Internet Archive\u2019sWayback Machine, which regularly archives many government webpages.\u00c2 \u00c2 Our study of language use on federal webpages shows:\u00c2 In the aggregate, there have been significant but uneven shifts toward more inclusive identity language on federal webpages Our analysis of almost 150 federal government webpages on LGBTQ-related topics, all of which were created before President Trump took office and continue to be live on the web, reveals that, under the Trump administration,federal government webpages addressing LGBTQ-related topics use the terms \u00e2\u0080\u009cgender\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009ctransgender\u00e2\u0080\u009d more and the terms \u00e2\u0080\u009csex\u00e2\u0080\u009d less. However, there is considerable variation between departments and within departments. HHS.gov appears to have shifted away from identity language but toward \u00e2\u0080\u009creligious freedom\u00e2\u0080\u009d language Our analysis of 1,875 HHS.gov webpages on all topics for LGBTQ-related terms, showed that LGBTQ-related terms are used less often under the Trump administration with a 25% reduction in the use of the term \u00e2\u0080\u009cgender\u00e2\u0080\u009d and a 40% reduction in the use of \u00e2\u0080\u009ctransgender.\u00e2\u0080\u009d By contrast, the use of terms like \u00e2\u0080\u009cfaith-based and community organizations,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009creligious freedom,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cconscience protection\u00e2\u0080\u009d all increased markedly. Our examination of key case studies of changed LGBTQ-related content on federal agency websites identifies two key trends:\u00c2 The removal of access to resources about discrimination protections and prevention, especially for transgender individuals The removal of resources containing LGBTQ community-specific information The case studies include previously reported changes, such asalterations to languagerelating to sex discrimination on webpages about Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act, the removal of Department of Housing and Urban Development resources on transgender protections in homeless shelters, and the removal of Department of Education guidance about protections for transgender students. In addition to these reported changes, several unreported findings are discussed, including: The Department of Labor scrubbed references to an existing executive order, adding \u00e2\u0080\u009cgender identity\u00e2\u0080\u009d as a protected class The Department of Labor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs altered an FAQ page on sexual orientation and gender identity to remove references to Executive Order 13672. The EO was issued in 2014 around the same time as EO 13673, which was rescinded by the Trump administration in 2017. EO 13672 is still in force. WIP Senior Investigator, Jon Campbell, explores the meaning and consequences of this change in his latest blog, \u201cChanges to Department of Labor and Healthcare.gov websites foreshadowed formal LGBTQ policy shifts.\u201c The Department of Health and Human Services appeared to downgrade an LGBT data improvement goal Two pages on Healthypeople.gov, the website of an interagency initiative that sets \u00e2\u0080\u009cscience-based, 10-year national objectives for improving the health of all Americans,\u00e2\u0080\u009d were altered to reduce LGBT-community data coverage goals. Without notice or annotation, as was done for past revisions, the 2020 coverage target for the \u00e2\u0080\u009cnumber of states, territories and the District of Columbia that include questions on sexual orientation and gender identity in the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS)\u00e2\u0080\u009d objective was reduced from \u00e2\u0080\u009cTotal coverage\u00e2\u0080\u009d to a \u00e2\u0080\u009c10 percent improvement.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The report is available athttps://sunlightfoundation.com/lgbtq-trend-report/. **Contact Us** Contact About Us Jobs Facebook Twitter Flickr Instagram Tumblr YouTube **Privacy** Ourprivacy policydetails how personally identifiable information that is collected on our web sites is handled.
