By helping alert policymakers to unequal tariff taxation of American women, and tariff rates biased against lower-income families, their bill will help us design a better and fairer system. \u201cEconomists have long known that tariffs are a poor form of taxation. As taxation of purchases of goods, they tax hourly-wage families more than wealthy households, and impose greater cost burdens on goods-using industries like retail, manufacturing, farming, restaurants, and homebuilding than on services- and investment-heavy industries. Even within this context, the U.S. tariff system is far more regressive than those of most of our trading partners \u2014 for example, by taxing polyester clothes more heavily than silks, and cheap stainless steel silverware more than sterling silver. And it appears to be unique in the world in taxing women\u2019s clothes more heavily than directly analogous men\u2019s clothes. This gender bias in the two clothing chapters likely costs women at least $2.5 billion per year. \u201cThe Pink Tariffs Study Act directs the Treasury Department to conduct a formal study of the U.S. tariff system for gender bias and regressivity \u2014 something neither the Treasury Department nor other trade agencies with tariff powers, such as Customs and Border Protection or the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, have ever done. This would give Congress the data and information it will need as it reasserts its Constitutional authority over tariff policy and begins to undo the harms Mr. Trump\u2019s policies are causing. We are proud to applaud and endorse their work.\u201d Gresser\u2019s pathbreaking research has repeatedlyanalyzed U.S. tariff datato explain an opaque system andilluminate inequity inthe country\u2019s tariff taxation system, especially on women\u2019s clothes and household consumer goods such as shoes, silverware, and home linens. Most recently,PPI has warned of the economic risks posed by Trump\u2019s tariff policies in arecent reportand detailed these concerns intestimonybefore Congress.PPIoutlinedfour key principlesfor responding to tariff-driven economic isolationism: Defend the Constitution and oppose attempts to rule by decree Connect tariff policy to growth, work, prices, family budgets, and living standards Stand by America\u2019s neighbors and allies Offer a positive alternative For further context on the Constitution over tariffs and taxation and how the legislative, not executive branch, has the authority, see thefull text of the U.S. Constitution. Founded in 1989, PPI is a catalyst for policy innovation and political reform based in Washington, D.C.
