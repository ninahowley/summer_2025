We then turn to time horizons of AI agents, the impact of automating scientific research, and constraints on scaling inference compute. Zvi also addresses humanity\u2019s uncertain AI-driven future, the unique features setting AI apart from other technologies, and AI\u2019s growing influence in financial trading.You can follow Zvi's excellent bloghere.Timestamps:00:00:00 Preview and introduction00:02:01 Sycophantic AIs00:07:28 Bottlenecks for AI agents00:21:26 Are benchmarks useful?00:32:39 AI agent time horizons00:44:18 Impact of automating research00:53:00 Limits to scaling inference compute01:02:51 Will the future go well for humanity?01:12:22 A good plan for safe AI01:26:03 What makes AI different?01:31:29 AI in trading On this episode, Zvi Mowshowitz joins me to discuss sycophantic AIs, bottlenecks limiting autonomous AI agents, and the true utility of benchmarks in measuring progress.
