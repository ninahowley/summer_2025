Find this story in your account\u2019s\u2018Saved for Later\u2019section. Today, Hulu is premieringCall Her Alex, a two-part documentary about the rise ofCall Her Daddy\u2019s Alex Cooper, directed by Ry Russo-Young. The doc traces Cooper\u2019s origin story as a bullied middle-schooler making home videos in her suburban basement;her complicated history as a Division 1 soccer player at Boston University; the launch ofCall Her Daddyin 2018, the fallout with her original co-host, Sofia Franklyn; and what it\u2019s like making today\u2019s less-sexual,celebrity-driven, and highly lucrative version of the podcast. A post shared by Hulu (@hulu) Call Her Alexis an interesting, if somewhat limited, look at the woman behind the $125 million podcast deal. There are a few glimpses into her off-mic personality: Her husband, Matt Kaplan, a film producer who is incredibly involved in the CHD business, reveals she does not pop her pimples. Cooper herself says she identifies as a \u201czillennial\u201d (she was born in 1994; I\u2019d say that\u2019s fair). She also offers up tons of footage from her home-video days that shows the now-very-blonde star was born with red hair (and was bullied for it, she says). More revealing is the fact that her parents, Bryan and Laurie Cooper, steadfastly supported her career, even at the beginning, when she was recording particularly graphic episodes like the infamous\u201cGluck Gluck 9000.\u201dBoth appear throughout the documentary and insist they always encouraged their daughter, despite some shaming from other family members and friends in their community. Cooper\u2019s most serious disclosure, however, comes at the end of part one. She accuses the now-retired Boston University women\u2019s soccer coach, Nancy Feldman, ofsexually harassingher throughout her three years on the team (Cooper quit after her junior year when the administration, she says, refused to do anything about the harassment). She says Feldman took a special interest in her and often attempted to isolate her from her teammates and ask her about her sex life. \u201cIt was this psychotic game of, \u2018You want to play? Tell me about your sex life,\u2019\u201d she says. Cooper is less forthcoming about the breakdown of her relationship with Franklyn, her former co-host who leftCall Her Daddyduring a contract dispute with Barstool Sports in 2020. Cooper admits she and Franklyn were roommates but had only known each other for a few months when they started recording the podcast together. \u201cIt was the classic, \u2018You think you see something online and people genuinely believe you\u2019re like sisters, but our relationship was so awful,\u2019\u201d she says. But she leaves it there. The Daddy Gang, as Cooper\u2019s fans are known, will probably most appreciate the previously unseen footage from herweddingto Kaplan that comes at the end of part two. Cooper and Kaplan cry as they say their vows (both prewritten in little white books). \u201cYou\u2019re the best man I\u2019ve ever met,\u201d Cooper tells her husband. \u201cYou inspire me every day. You\u2019re the most passionate about the people you love. Fiercely loyal, it\u2019s almost scary at times. And the way you love me is indescribable.\u201d But this is not a reality show. The doc does show some moments of Cooper and Kaplan relaxing in hotel rooms and in their palatial L.A. home, but there are no arguments or even stress, really: Kaplan mixes Cooper a martini, the two cuddle with their dogs. If fans want to see an unfiltered Cooper, they may be better off listening to old podcast episodes. **Stay in touch.** By submitting your email, you agree to ourTermsandPrivacy Noticeand to receive email correspondence from us. **Related** Alex Cooper Says She Was Sexually Harassed by Her Soccer Coach **Tags:** alex cooper call her daddy celebrity culture documentaries More Things you buy through our links may earnVox Mediaa commission **The Cut Shop** 29 Best Sneakers for Women in Every Single Style I\u2019m on the Hunt for the Best Sunscreens Without a White Cast 31 Best Luxury Candles That Double As Great Gifts **Most Viewed Stories** Aaron Rodgers Is Married Now Your Daily Horoscope by Madame Clairevoyant: June 11, 2025 What Does Call Her Daddy\u2019s Alex Cooper Reveal inCall Her Alex? \u2018Can I Ask About Salary Before a Job Interview?\u2019 Dakota Johnson Is \u2018Always Psyched\u2019 to Film Sex Scenes Aaron Rodgers Is Married Now What Does Call Her Daddy\u2019s Alex Cooper Reveal inCall Her Alex?
