2025 IPI World Congress: Registration Open **Autocrats Unleashed: Defending Free Journalism Amid Rising Authoritarianism and Declining Accountability** April 25, 2025 Join IPI for a parallel event in Brussels, held alongside World Press Freedom Day Share on Facebook Share on X Share on Bluesky Share on LinkedIn Independent journalism across Europe faces a wide range of threats, including media capture, impunity for crimes against journalists, threats to journalists\u2019 safety, vexatious lawsuits, smear campaigns, illegal spyware and increasingly restrictive legislation on content and funding. In recent months the social tension created by the squeezing of democratic norms has seen a wave of protests against autocratic rule. Journalists have been at the heart of developments, struggling to report the events while also being targeted by governments for doing so. Since November 28, 2024, when protests against the Georgian Dream\u2019s decision to pause EU membership negotiations started, Georgia has seenover 90 journalistsbeaten and arrested, Turkeyrecordeddozens of arrests and fines against broadcasters since the arrest of Istanbul Mayor and Presidential Candidate, Ekrem Imamoglu in March. In Serbia, the heavy-handed government response to nationwide student-led protests over the Novi Sad train station collapse has seen a deepening of an existing campaign of pressure andattacks against independent media and critical voices, with increasing smear campaigns from high level politicians,spyware threatsand physical attacks against journalists reporting the streets. Slovakia and Hungary meanwhile seek to further tighten legislation against independent media particularly those reliant on foreign funding to pursue their profession. Yet independent journalists refuse to be silenced. They continue to report critical news and information, shed light on abuses of power and corruption and hold those responsible accountable. **The IPI Weekly Digest** Subscribe for press freedom news and updates, opportunities for journalists, and the latest in media innovation. In these extraordinary times, when the international rules based order is under attack, far-right and illiberal forces are on the rise, and democratic freedoms are being eroded, how can journalists, media freedom groups and the international community, including the EU respond to the multiple crises facing press freedom and democratic governance? We are bringing together journalists and press freedom experts from Hungary, Slovakia, Turkey, Georgia and Serbia to address these challenges to media freedom head on. Together, we will explore the role of international advocacy, examine some of the tools being developed under the EU\u2019s Democracy Shield, and discuss how the international community can act collectively to safeguard media freedom as one of the major pillars of democracy.
