Mar 13, 2025Kirsten KorosecWhat we discovered when we finally matched with a Waymo robotaxiImage Credits:Kirsten KorosecTheWaymo on Uber robotaxi servicelaunched in Austin a week before SXSW and it\u2019s been a challenge actually matching with one. In Phoenix, San Francisco, and Los Angeles, consumers use the Waymo One app to hail a ride. And it\u2019s always a robotaxi.Here in Austin, consumers use the Uber app and sometimes they\u2019re matched with a robotaxi. Usually they get a human driver. Waymo helped TechCrunch coordinate a robotaxi ride. And that was fine and all, but we wanted an experience that was less orchestrated.We got lucky Thursday morning and were matched. The drive itself was uneventful, although the route was longer than what Google Maps suggested (I always compare). Waymo told me that the vehicles were being routed around certain areas, which may explain the difference.We did notice some new stuff though. Namely, the user interface, which includes the two displays inside the vehicle that shows the robotaxi and its surroundings. Waymo confirmed the updates and noted that these occur continuously.Here\u2019s what we spotted. The display now shows the turn signals, hazards, and brake lights of vehicles in front of, and around, the robotaxi. Waymo now colors pedestrians, cyclists, and parked vehicles differently and the display highlights the destination building as the rider arrives at their drop off point. Finally, the Waymo display shows stop signs and traffic cones.Updated 3 months ago Kirsten Korosec **What we discovered when we finally matched with a Waymo robotaxi** TheWaymo on Uber robotaxi servicelaunched in Austin a week before SXSW and it\u2019s been a challenge actually matching with one.

Really,reallylight on tech.In years past, the hall was brimming with startups.

Oh, and of course the parties too.Founders were out and about \u2014 and looking for funding. There were delegations of founders too, coming from Europe, Australia, and Brazil. Notably, I didn\u2019t encounter much chatter of dual-use or defense startups. Although that might have been due to circumstances \u2014 SXSW tends to spread out.Quantum computing has been having a moment at SXSW with several talks on Wednesday and today. Plus, Marc Maron, the comedian whose podcast \u201cWTF with Marc Maron,\u201d receives over 80 million listeners per year,riffedon a lot of topics, including an earnest exclamation that the podcast will never get into video.And we managed to get matched with a Waymo robotaxi with the Uber app. Hooray.

Duringhis SXSW keynoteon Wednesday in Austin, Texas, the musician joked about using ChatGPT to determine which songs to play for his shows.In an interview conducted by Tom Morello (of Rage Against the Machine and Audioslave), Fogerty was asked how he decided on a setlist for a given evening, like his concert at SXSW the previous night.\u201cI just go on ChatGPT or whatever,\u201d Fogerty said, leading the audience to howl with laughter.He then added that \u201cyou learn a whole lot trying to be an entertainer,\u201d and said he just wanted people to have fun at the concert. \u201cI want them to join in. I want them to sing along.\u201dThe interview also touched on CCR history, music publishing rights, and the stories behind some of the band\u2019s songs, among other things.At one point, Fogerty also pointed out how the medium we use to consume music defines how it\u2019s presented.\u201cSongs have always sort of been manifested by the medium that they\u2019re on. I mean, the three-minute song or so was invented because of the 78 record. You just couldn\u2019t put more stuff in there,\u201d he said.

Mar 12, 2025Rebecca BellanYour living room on wheelsI just moderated my second panel at SXSW: Engineering Joyrides with Gretchen Effgen (director of global automotive partnerships at Google), Pankaj Kedia (VP of commercial partnerships at Dolby), and Alan Wexler (SVP of strategy and innovation at GM). It was a lively discussion about what in-car entertainment looks like today and what it\u2019ll be in the future, as more cars develop autonomous capabilities.The talk followed some news from the three companies.GM a few days ago announcedthat its electric Cadillac OPTIQ and VISTIQ will feature Dolby Atmos immersive sound, available through Amazon Music. It\u2019s the start of a larger rollout of Dolby\u2019s system as a standard feature in certain 2025 and 2026 Cadillac models, and will be available across Cadillac\u2019s entire 2026 EV lineup.The Optiq and other GM vehicles will also have Google built in, meaning they\u2019ll come with Google features like Maps, Assistant, Play, and personalized suggestions.With the software-defined vehicle, cars have the potential to become your living room on wheels. But how will automakers balance cool tech offerings with distracting feature bloat? How much is improving our lives (like Dolby\u2019s sound system), and how much is just frustrating (like everything controlled by a touchscreen)?This story was corrected to note that the immersive sound is available through Amazon Music.Updated 3 months ago Rebecca Bellan **Your living room on wheels** I just moderated my second panel at SXSW: Engineering Joyrides with Gretchen Effgen (director of global automotive partnerships at Google), Pankaj Kedia (VP of commercial partnerships at Dolby), and Alan Wexler (SVP of strategy and innovation at GM).

Mar 12, 2025Sarah PerezCharina Chou, COO of Google Quantum AI, on the need for government investment in quantum computingCharina Chou, COO ofGoogle Quantum AI, argued for government investment in the quantum computing market, arguing that no company could develop the technology successfully on its own.\u201cThe transistor \u2026 was funded by U.S. government fundamental research investments in science,\u201d Chou explained whilespeakingat the SXSW conference in Austin on Wednesday.\u201cThat is what has given rise even to a lot of the advances we have in quantum computing today \u2014 it\u2019s all based on basic science \u2026 No one company is going to do this on their own. No one team can do it on their own. You\u2019ve got to have a whole community of researchers. And government investment in this is critical,\u201d she said.In addition, Chou pointed out that China is currently outspending the U.S. two to one on quantum research. Not only would that mean the U.S. could fall behind in critical areas, but there\u2019s also the potential that quantum computing could break the encryption that today protects secure communications.\u201cIt\u2019s important to note that that\u2019s expected to take a computer that is one or two orders of magnitude more powerful than that would be required for chemistry materials, so it is farther down the road, but you can imagine that has massive national security implications,\u201d Chou said. \u201cAnd you would want the U.S. to have that capability.\u201dChou also talked about the broader potential for quantum computing, the types of problems it could solve, and other mysteries and misunderstandings about the technology.She pointed to possibilities like cancer drug testing, creating a mathematical model of a cell; breaking encryption; building better batteries and solar cells; helping solve the climate crises; optimizing anything from shipping routes to investments, fusion energy, more efficient energy use, and more.\u201cIf you took home just one message, it would be that quantum computers are capable of solving problems that are impossible for AI or supercomputers,\u201d Chou said.Updated 3 months ago Sarah Perez **Charina Chou, COO of Google Quantum AI, on the need for government investment in quantum computing** Charina Chou, COO ofGoogle Quantum AI, argued for government investment in the quantum computing market, arguing that no company could develop the technology successfully on its own. \u201cThe transistor \u2026 was funded by U.S. government fundamental research investments in science,\u201d Chou explained whilespeakingat the SXSW conference in Austin on Wednesday. \u201cThat is what has given rise even to a lot of the advances we have in quantum computing today \u2014 it\u2019s all based on basic science \u2026 No one company is going to do this on their own.
