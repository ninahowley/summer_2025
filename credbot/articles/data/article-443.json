We get lost in the fun and charm of the music, dancing, and wigs! We delight in the beauty of Dolly Parton and Burt Reynolds! And we get caught up in a discussion of whether a movie like this could be made today, with its light-hearted treatment of sex workers being unfairly persecuted. Plus, an unhinged installment of the \u201cwhat\u2019s wrong with me\u201d game returns, as we decide which famous men we\u2019d let watch our drinks.
