solidarity with L.A. anti-ICE demonstrations** Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email A driver plowed through a group of protesters Tuesday in the Loop, apparently striking at least one pedestrian, as thousands marched through downtown Chicago protesting the Trump administration\u2019s ongoing immigration raids. The driver was stuck between police vehicles on State Street. Officers wanted to guide her away from the crowd and asked her to turn right on Monroe Street, but she ignored their orders and turned left, speeding into the crowd. One officer tried to get the driver to stop and pulled on the driver\u2019s-side door handle, but the driver sped off. Shortly after the car plowed through the crowd, it appeared to hit a woman who fell to the ground. Protesters gathered around her to offer help. Chicago police did not release information about the driver as of late Tuesday night, and it wasn\u2019t immediately clear if anyone was hospitalized. The incident happened astwo protests of recent Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrests hit Chicago\u2019s streets Tuesday afternoonbefore merging into one large protest. It was the latest in a string of demonstrations in support of immigrant communities in the city. There were some skirmishes between police and protesters as officers \u2014 some clutching batons \u2014 tried to hold their ground. In one clash near Washington and State, protesters could be heard screaming \u201cno violence\u201d and \u201clet him go\u201d as officers tried to detain a man in a bicycle helmet. Although several people could be seen being taken into custody, police did not immediately say how many arrests were made. **\u2018If I don\u2019t speak up for her, who will?\u2019** The protests follow President Donald Trump\u2019s monthslong campaign against immigration, as the government ramps up the number of arrests immigration officers must make each day. The first demonstration, with a few hundred people, started Tuesday afternoon outside immigration court, 50 E. Adams St., and proceeded toward Federal Plaza, 230 S. Dearborn St., where it converged with a larger group of protesters. Thousands marched through the Loop, shutting down CTA bus service and creating a standstill on DuSable Lake Shore Drive near Grant Park as protesters crossed the thoroughfare. Ivanna Vidal was walking out of her downtown workplace when she saw a group of protesters marching down La Salle Street. She took one look at their signs and decided to join. \u201cAbolish ICE\u201d and \u201cNo human is Illegal\u201d read some of the signs. \u201cI\u2019m a first-generation citizen, my parents were born in Mexico. It\u2019s something I\u2019m super-passionate about,\u201d said Vidal, 19, of West Lawn. Vidal said she doesn\u2019t know anyone who has been impacted by the recent raids but wanted to show support to those who have. \u201cMy family is safe, but there are many who aren\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is impacting our community, and we need to stand up for those who can\u2019t speak up for themselves.\u201d Lizbeth Rios of Gage Park joined the demonstration to advocate for immigrants in Chicago, including her family. Her mother, who is undocumented, immigrated from Mexico to Chicago more than 30 years ago. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t have status, but I do, and if I don\u2019t speak up for her, who will?\u201d said Rios, 25. Rios said she was glad to see protests occurring across the country but said she doubted they would lead to policy changes. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s much that can be done, but we can only hope,\u201d she said. \u201cI think that unless you\u2019re undocumented, or know someone who is, you\u2019ll never truly understand or feel like us who are out here today.\u201d Some people arrived with friends, others showed up with their children. A migrant woman with her child wrapped around her back moved through the crowd trying to sell candy. \u201cI think that everybody deserves a chance,\u201d said Maria Johnson, 23. \u201cI mean, you\u2019re, if you are on TikTok or Instagram or anything, you are getting firsthand perspectives of people getting dragged out of their homes or their workplaces. And it\u2019s upsetting. I just don\u2019t think that\u2019s [the] America I thought I was gonna have to deal with.\u201d Meanwhile, Mariana Gonzalez and Lizbeth Alvarez were walking downtown when they heard chants nearby. They joined other protesters as they heard calls for an end to the raids. \u201cI thought the raids would stop, but they\u2019re just getting worse,\u201d said Mariana, 16. \u201cMy parents are immigrants from Mexico and they can\u2019t be [out here], but we can.\u201d Lizbeth, also 16, said, \u201cNo matter how small, we\u2019re using our voices, and it sends a message.\u201d **Demonstrations in solidarity with L.A. protests** Organizers of Tuesday\u2019s protests said they also rallied in solidarity withthe protests in Los Angeles. Other ICE protests have popped up in New York, San Francisco, Dallas and Austin, Texas. The largely peaceful demonstrations that started Friday in Los Angeles intensified over the weekend after Trump deployed 2,000 National Guard troops to the city without California Gov. Gavin Newsom\u2019s authorization, with the first wave arriving Sunday. The extraordinary move spurred anger from protesters and lawmakers. Trump then deployed another 2,000 National Guard members and 700 Marines to the city Monday. \u201cCities across the country are taking to the streets throughout the week in a national call to action to demobilize ICE and the National Guard from attacking and occupying our communities,\u201d organizers for Tuesday evening\u2019s protest said in a news release. On Tuesday, Newsom asked a federal court to block the Trump administration from using the National Guard and Marines to assist with immigration raids in Los Angeles, saying it would only heighten tensions. A judge has set a hearing for Thursday. **No Kings protest planned for Saturday** Advocacy organizations like Indivisible Chicago are planning a mass \u201cNo Kings Day of Defiance\u201d protest at noon Saturday to protest the ICE arrests and the Trump administration\u2019s policies.According to the group\u2019s website, similar protests are set to kick off in more than 1,000 cities across the country. The rallies are intended to counter the military parade Trump has planned to mark the U.S. Army\u2019s 250th birthday. In a statement released Sunday during the protests in Los Angeles, organizers said, \u201cPresident Trump wants you to believe that the people of Los Angeles are destroying their own communities. That\u2019s false. Here\u2019s the truth: people are peacefully and lawfully protesting the Administration\u2019s abuses of power and the abduction of their neighbors by ICE.\u201d Contributing: Associated Press Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email Senator Fowler Launches 2025 Summer Reading Program for K-8 Students SSM Health Honors Organ Donors with Lasting Tribute Installation Road Closure Announced for Murphysboro Drivers Starting June 9 Falcon PRIDE at SIC Helps Young Adults with Disabilities Build Skills, Jobs, and Confidence youtube facebook Contact Us Careers Reports Ways to Connect Donate Support Passport Help Privacy Policy Southern Illinois University Office of the Chancellor SIU College of Arts & Media SIU Board of Trustees"}
