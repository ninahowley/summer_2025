MCALLISTER News Chronicle Note: After this story went to press, Judge Cox denied Salt Creek Wind\u2019s May 30 application for an emergency injunction without prejudice, writing on May 31: \u201cThe Court denies without prejudice as these issues can be remedied by the Plaintiffs. The Court suggests the parties discuss the actions taken by the Board since the injunction hearing in an attempt to reach an agreement. If the parties are unable to reach an agreement, then the Court may be utilized as appropriate.\u201d This story will publish in the Friday, June 6, 2025 print edition of the News Chronicle. TOLEDO \u2013 Following years of conflict in the court of public opinion, the future of commercial wind energy conversion systems (CWECS) development in Tama County appeared to finally be on the path to a concrete legal decision in Tama County District Court when a hearing was held on Tuesday, May 27, for the Feb. 5, 2025 petition filed by Salt Creek Wind LLC (SCW) against the Board of Supervisors and the County. But all that was thrown into further chaos later in the week when the existence of a purported construction stay of the project by the Board was brought forward for enforcement. On Friday, May 30, Salt Creek in turn filed an emergency application for a temporary injunction against such enforcement, requesting expedited relief and a virtual hearing. \u201cThis emergency application is the result of Defendants\u2019 abuse of authority and blatant disregard for Plaintiff\u2019s rights and this Court\u2019s own authority and jurisdiction,\u201d SCW\u2019s emergency filing states. \u201cThis Application involves identical issues of fact and law as those heard by Judge [David M.] Cox at the parties\u2019 hearing on Plaintiff\u2019s Application for Temporary Injunction on May 27, 2025.\u201d During the May 27 hearing in the case in which SCW \u2013 acquired in Nov. 2024 by NextEra Energy Resources, LLC \u2013 seeks clarification that the Jan. 2025 moratorium on development and construction of CWECS does not apply to its central Tama County project, Dexter Liu, executive director at NextEra and assistant vice president for the SCW project, took his seat in the witness chair for much of the half-day hearing as the plaintiff\u2019s only witness; Tama County\u2019s counsel cross-examined Liu while never calling any witness of their own. Attorney Sarah K. Franklin, SCW\u2019s counsel, began her questioning of Liu by taking him through the project\u2019s baseline and current status. During questioning, he described SCW as an approximately 170 MW wind project (1MW at peak output could power approximately 700 homes, Liu indicated) located southwest of Traer and consisting of approximately 60 wind turbines that had been in development \u201cfor a long time.\u201d When asked to describe the project\u2019s current status, Liu stated it was \u201cextremely mature\u201d with all land agreements secured, an interconnection agreement contractually signed and ready to go, permits in hand, required surveys and studies completed, and a commercial agreement for procurement of power in place.

Construction on the 170 MW project which includes 60 turbines continues as of press time. PHOTO BY RUBY F. MCALLISTER In addressing the project\u2019s current status, Liu said construction was ongoing as of that moment, telling the court he was \u201cactually just there this morning\u201d at the laydown yard (SCW\u2019s base of operations located at the intersection of US 63 and 220th Street southwest of Traer). Liu said there were currently 50-some people on site with that number expected to swell to nearly 250 at its peak later this summer. The total anticipated investment in Tama County as it relates to SCW is pegged at $270 million, Liu said. \u201cThat is all of the equipment that goes in \u2026 all civil work \u2026 all construction labor \u2026 land use agreements \u2013 initially paid to develop the project, all of the development fees \u2026 as well as interconnection of the project itself,\u201d he said. The project should generate approximately $50 million in tax revenue over its lifespan, he added, while also generating approximately $2.5 million in estimated economic activity locally (based on third party research) and approximately $7.5 million in revenue for the State of Iowa. PHOTO BY RUBY F. MCALLISTER Franklin also took Liu through the project\u2019s conditional use permit (CUP) granted by the Board of Adjustment in Dec. 8, 2020, and never appealed. She likewise went through SCW\u2019s zoning application for 60 turbines and one (1) substation which was approved by the Zoning Administrator on Sept. 16, 2024. \u201cThese are the zoning certificates related to the Salt Creek Wind project, right?\u201d Franklin asked. \u201cYes,\u201d Liu said in response. \u201cTo your knowledge, is there any pending appeal of the zoning certificates?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d he replied. Liu then described the financial commitment NextEra and previous project owners had made and/or plan to make toward the project including $140 million already expended to acquire all 60 turbines, $12 million on development work by the prior owner, and an additional $9 million spent by NextEra on ongoing construction and engineering efforts since acquisition. In closing arguments which took place later that morning close to noon, SCW stated that \u201cover 50 percent of the total cost of this project\u201d was spent or committed prior to the Jan. 6, 2025 moratorium enacted by the Board of Supervisors. \u201cIf this project doesn\u2019t move forward,\u201d Franklin asked Liu, \u201cdoes NextEra have another use for the 60 turbines that it has purchased?\u201d \u201cIt does not have an alternate site for the turbines,\u201d he replied. \u201cDoes Salt Creek Wind have another use for the 60 turbines that it has purchased,\u201d she asked. PHOTO BY RUBY F. MCALLISTER \u201cIt does not,\u201d he said. Liu added that NextEra would incur approximately $70 million in fines (as of the end of April) if the purchase of the turbines is not finalized; later he stated delaying the project would cost the company approximately $2.5 million per month including turbine storage costs. Franklin also addressed Tama County\u2019s recent denial of SCW\u2019s application for a zoning certificate for a meteorological station (LiDAR) submitted on Jan. 24, 2025. The application was denied by Zoning Administrator Laura Wilson on May 20, 2025. In the denial letter, Liu said, the moratorium was cited as the basis for the decision. \u201cDid a delay in processing this permit cause harm to Salt Creek Wind?\u201d Franklin asked. \u201cYes, it introduced significant uncertainty in terms of how Tama County was dealing with the moratorium,\u201d Liu replied before later stating, \u201cThe large logistical effort that\u2019s required and our committed spend to the project would be at harm if the moratorium were to be applied by Tama County to this project. County cross-examines Attorney Michael R. Reck, representing the Board of Supervisors, also questioned Liu during the hearing, at one point focusing on the Nov. 2024 election during which Tama County moved from three supervisors to five \u2013 four of those elected were new to the position. \u201cSir, are you aware that Tama County voters overwhelmingly elected supervisors who had been raising questions about this project?\u201d \u201cI am aware that new supervisors were elected recently, over the last seven or eight months or so, in Tama County, yes,\u201d Liu replied. When asked how much NextEra paid to acquire SCW, an objection was raised by Franklin. In response to Judge Cox\u2019s inquiry regarding the line of questioning, Reck replied, \u201cThey\u2019re claiming a vested right. But this is a company that stepped into this knowing these issues. They bought a pig in a poke, and we intend to demonstrate that. And I think we have a right to show how much they spent to [acquire the project] \u2013 if it was $1, then they really knew what the problem was, right? If it was $50 million, then we have a different sort of issue.\u201d Ultimately, Judge Cox ruled the courtroom would need to be cleared to address the acquisition costs (due to a protective order requested by SCW) and would reserve doing so until the end of the hearing. Later, when asking Liu about any warranties NextEra may have secured prior to its purchase of the project, Reck said he was addressing \u201cthe same issue.\u201d \u201cWe think that it was obvious that this project was built on a faulty foundation \u2013 that it violated the ordinances from the very beginning. And we suspect, if they did their due diligence, they would absolutely know that and should have gotten warranties,\u201d Reck told the judge. \u201cDo you understand supervisors are likely to be the voice of the Tama County residents?\u201d Reck later asked Liu before adding, \u201cDo you agree elected officials should listen to constituents\u2019 concerns?\u201d To both, Liu responded affirmatively. Reck then asked if Liu understood \u201cthe moratorium was put in place to allow Tama County to review and address concerns\u201d related to CWECS. Liu responded that he could not speak to the exact discussion by the supervisors regarding the moratorium. Reck also asked Liu if NextEra sought a \u201cvariance from the moratorium,\u201d to which Liu responded, \u201cI can\u2019t speak to whether this is specifically a variance or not, but I know that we did submit a zoning certificate (application) for a LiDAR device as we discussed earlier.\u201d In reference to SCW\u2019s application for an extension of its zoning certificates \u2013 an application which was approved in the fall of 2024 by now-former Zoning Administrator Bob Vokoun \u2013 Reck asked Liu if he knew Vokoun \u201chad been a vocal advocate of this Salt Creek Wind project?\u201d before later referring to Vokoun as the \u201closing candidate\u201d for the seat now held by Supervisor Heather Knebel. Knebel defeated Vokoun in a three-way GOP primary in June 2024. \u201cWe had started construction on the project, but we had also filed for an extension as a standard practice to grant additional time,\u201d Liu said in reference to SCW\u2019s extension request on the 90-day period to start the project.\u201d Questions surrounding Vokoun were repeatedly objected to by Franklin on relevance grounds. \u201cWhat they have done is they have gone and sought extreme extensions of the 90-day permit,\u201d Reck told the judge. \u201cThey went to the losing candidate who they knew advocated on their behalf and they got the permit extension five-fold over what the ordinance provides. And they did it intentionally to try to put this beyond the reach of the supervisors \u2026 before they took office.\u201d After ascertaining Vokoun was the Zoning Administrator as of Dec. 6, 2024, Judge Cox pointedly asked Reck, \u201cWho else would they have sent [the extension application] to?\u201d Later, following a brief recess, Reck addressed inconsistencies in the model of turbine NextEra had procured for the Salt Creek Wind project in comparison to what was specified in the 2020 CUP application. \u201cAre you using any of those four turbines identified in the CUP application of this project?\u201d Reck asked. \u201cNot these four specific turbine types,\u201d Liu said while holding a copy of SCW\u2019s 2020 CUP application before adding, \u201cNo, we are not using any of the turbines listed in this table here.\u201d Reck also addressed alleged inconsistencies between maps of collection lines for the project contained in both the CUP application and the zoning certificates, repeatedly showing Liu map after map for specific turbine locations. After repeated questioning \u2013 and repeated objections by Franklin, some which were upheld by the judge \u2013 Liu conceded, \u201cThere appear to be some differences,\u201d before later stating, \u201cWe represent a proposed location for electrical lines in the conditional use permit application.\u201d Toward the end of his time, Reck also brought up SCW\u2019s decommissioning plan which includes a bond for the project. Whether done intentionally with malice or just sloppy legalwork, Reck pointed out at least one instance in the decommissioning plan which refers to a location not in Tama County \u2013 Cedar Rapids. He also pointed out an instance where a different project \u2013 the Rock Creek Solar Project which is also not in Tama County \u2013 was referenced, among other inconsistencies. Closing arguments, new filing In their closing arguments, SCW\u2019s counsel said they believed Liu\u2019s testimony coupled with the hundreds, if not thousands, of pages of evidence submitted to Judge Cox indicates the company is \u201clikely to prevail\u201d on the merits of vested rights. SCW also rebuked the County\u2019s claims NextEra is acting unlawfully \u2013 citing both the valid CUP application dating back to 2020 and the zoning certificates which were appealed last fall before being reaffirmed by the Board of Adjustment. \u201cThe Board of Supervisors could have filed an action,\u201d attorney Elizabeth R. Meyer, Franklin\u2019s co-counsel, stated. \u201cThe Board of Supervisors\u2019 members could have filed their own action. They did not do so, they are time barred. The law provides appeal periods for a reason. Parties are entitled to legal certainty, and Salt Creek Wind now has legal certainty with regard to both the [CUP] and the zoning certificates.\u201d To wrap up SCW\u2019s arguments, Meyer said, in part, \u201cAn injunction is necessary to prevent substantial injury because the zoning certificates have inherent time limitations and \u2026 there is significant cost associated with a delay that could arise if some enforcement action or additional step is taken by the County related to the moratorium. \u2026 Salt Creek Wind has demonstrated that it is entitled to a temporary injunction while this suit is pending in order to protect its rights.\u201d In the County\u2019s closing arguments, the project was described by Reck as a \u201chouse of cards \u2013 its foundation is improper.\u201d He said the Board of Supervisors \u201calways has the power to change the law\u201d and that \u201cone prior board does not have the right to bind the future board, and this board has passed the moratorium.\u201d Reck further said in order for NextEra to cite vested rights, they needed to follow \u201cthe applicable law in submitting the CUP application\u201d \u2013 something the County alleges SCW did not do. \u201c[N]obody is above the law,\u201d Reck said. \u201cIt was built on a faulty application to begin with.\u201d Judge Cox closed the hearing, which began at 9 a.m. and ended just after 12:15 p.m., by stating he understood there was \u201ca lot of passion on both sides,\u201d but that he now faced combing through a tremendous amount of evidence while on a very tight work schedule. \u201cI\u2019ll give a ruling when I can,\u201d he said before citing late June or early July for his decision. As of press time, SCW had requested \u2013 through its May 30 emergency application for temporary injunction \u2013 that the Court \u201cimmediately grant an injunction prohibiting Defendants from taking any steps to enforce the purported \u2018automatic stay\u2019 of construction of the Project.\u201d \u201cAt the May 29, 2025 meeting, the Board of Supervisors, citing evidence \u2018learned\u2019 at the Injunction Hearing, announced their plans to halt construction at the Project pursuant to a purported \u2018stay,'\u201d SCW\u2019s emergency filing stated. \u201cSpecifically, Defendants erroneously claimed there is already a \u2018stay\u2019 of construction and announced their intention to direct the Tama County Sheriff\u2019s Office to physically halt construction of the Project pursuant to this non-existent \u2018stay.\u2019 \u2026 Notably, this argument was not made to the Court at the Injunction Hearing. At no point during the contested, half-day hearing did the County argue it had a stay or otherwise urge the Court to stay or enjoin ongoing construction of the Project. \u2026 The County\u2019s position that such a stay exists is erroneous as a matter of law.\u201d Doland, Knebel respond On May 28, Board Chairman Mark Doland and Supervisor Knebel \u2013 both present at the May 27 hearing \u2013 issued a press release in which they stated, in part, \u201cTestimony presented at the hearing answered many questions the Supervisors had previously posed to Salt Creek. The testimony and other evidence presented made clear that Salt Creek, now owned by NextEra Energy, did not comply with the Commercial Wind Energy Conversion System (\u2019C-WECS\u2019) zoning ordinance in submitting the application for a Conditional Use Permit (\u2018CUP\u2019) and that the zoning certificates issued to Salt Creek in September 2024 do not match the CUP application materials.\u201d \u201cWe are thankful that some of the lingering questions we had before the hearing have been answered. These answers only confirmed the concerns we have heard from citizens in regard to the Salt Creek Wind project, including the concerns that it had not complied with the ordinances at the outset,\u201d Doland said in the release. \u201cThis hearing is a significant step forward in ensuring that all projects within Tama County adhere to the established zoning ordinances. We are committed to maintaining the integrity of our zoning laws and ensuring that all applications are thoroughly reviewed and compliant,\u201d Knebel further added, while also stating, \u201cAs we look forward to next steps, it is important that we revisit the validity and legality of the permits and zoning certificates that have been issued by the previous zoning administrator and Board of Adjustment.\u201d \u201cNow that we have the answers to some of our questions, I believe that the Supervisors have a responsibility to ensure full compliance with the law. The Supervisors are assessing the appropriate avenues to address Salt Creek\u2019s non-compliance, including the numerous deficiencies in the CUP application and the failure to comply with the specifications and requirements in the C-WECS ordinance,\u201d Doland also stated. The press release ended with: \u201cThe Board of Supervisors intends to do just that and will consider the appropriate action to take at an upcoming meeting.\u201d This is a developing story. Editors\u2019 Note: On May 26, 2025, Salt Creek Wind filed a dismissal without prejudice of its April 16, 2025 petition against Tama County, the Tama County Board of Adjustment, and the Tama County Zoning Administrator \u2014 the second lawsuit filed by SCW involving the County. On May 28, 2025, that case was dismissed without prejudice by Judge Cox. **Local News** **Local News** **\u2018We\u2019ll keep being loud\u2019** **\u2018We\u2019ll keep being loud\u2019** **Traer Historical Museum BBQ fundraiser set for June 8** **Traer Historical Museum BBQ fundraiser set for June 8** TRAER \u2013 The Traer Historical Museum will hold a fundraising barbecue at the Traer Memorial building on Sunday, ... **South Tama Schools Summer Food Service Program** **South Tama Schools Summer Food Service Program** TAMA-TOLEDO \u2014 South Tama County Schools is participating in the Summer Food Service Program.
