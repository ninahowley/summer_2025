Miller, The Journalist's ResourceJune 10, 2025 As the U.S. government continues to remove data and make radical changes to its websites, reporters are encountering health data that\u2019s incomplete, altered or missing entirely. At the Association of Health Care Journalists\u2019 annual conference in Los Angeles on May 30, a panel of data-savvy journalists and data scientists shared strategies to uncover, safeguard and verify vital data. \u201cIn my entire career, I feel like the trajectory has been towards greater transparency and availability of data, especially public health data, and I really worry that we\u2019re now entering an era of data scarcity,\u201d saidJ. Emory Parker, data editor for STAT News, during his presentation. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to be entirely pessimistic. I think there is a lot of work we can do, and we can try.\u201d The panel, titled \u201cFinding data when people are hiding it from you,\u201d was moderated by MedPage Today\u2019s Washington editorJoyce Frieden. The speakers included Parker,Adam Rhodes, training director for the journalism organization Investigative Reporters & Editors (IRE),Sydney Lupkin, pharmaceutical correspondent for NPR, andDavid Radley, director of data and analytics at the Center for Evidence-Based Policy and senior scientist at the Commonwealth Fund. We have summarized their advice in eight tips. **1. Archive important data before it disappears** When the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s various datasets were at risk ofbeing taken down, Parker of STAT News sprang into action by backing up data fromdata.cdc.govusing scripting code and the site\u2019sApplication Programming Interface. API allows users to write code to get data from a website. \u201cAnd specifically, what was really useful about that is that there\u2019s a way to ask this website to generate just a complete list of every single dataset that is available,\u201d Parker said. He downloaded about 150 gigabytes of data and created a system to track changes to the available datasets in real time, starting January 28, 2025. The news organization\u2019s CDC data archives arepublicly available. Parker also used theWayback Machineto find some of the snapshots of the lists of datasets ondata.cdc.govto compare the rate of data removal before the second Trump administration began. The Wayback Machine is a digital archive of the Internet maintained by the Internet Archive, a nonprofit organization. He was able to compare the lists posted between November 2024 and January 2025, finding that the net drop in the number of datasets was about 20. In comparison, between Jan. 28 and Feb. 7, 2025, 153 datasets were removed, Parkerfound in his analysis. Internet Archive \u201cis going to be the single biggest resource we have going forward,\u201d Parker said. The WayBack Machine also has aSave Page Nowtool and similarwebsite extensions, which you can use to save and store a site in the archives. **2. Look beyond federal data sources** Find \u201cthe organizations that deal most specifically with the population that you\u2019re interested in talking to,\u201d Rhodes of IRE said. \u201cInstitutions and organizations that are more on the ground in those communities or serving those institutions, I think, will probably be the biggest bet going forward.\u201d For instance, theTrevor Projectis a great source of data on LGBTQ+ mental health, Rhodes said. The Journalist\u2019s Resourcehas a listof non-government health data alternatives and archives. Also, search for experts who may already be collecting the data you need. For instance, Rhodes saved time when reporting on a story about access to HIV treatment in Puerto Rico by finding a researcher at Columbia University who had already been studying the topic for years. \u201cI didn\u2019t have to interview hundreds of people,\u201d they said. \u201cI just talked to that one researcher.\u201d Collaboration among journalists and organizations can also help fill some of the data gaps. Parker cited theCOVID Tracking Projectas a model of collaboration among journalists and other volunteers. The organization, launched in 2020 from The Atlantic, includedhundreds of volunteerswho compiled, published and interpreted COVID-19 data from state, county and city health agencies at a time when the CDC was falling short of providing this critical information. \u201cI think to the extent that we\u2019re going to be facing really difficult data challenges over the next few years, I think we\u2019re probably going to be needing to think about other ways that we can sort of replicate that kind of mass collaboration between not just ourselves within newsrooms, but between newsrooms and between organizations,\u201d Parker said. **3. Verify all the data you find** \u201cWhen you find something online, the first thing you should think of is, \u2018How can I verify this?\u2019\u201d Rhodes said. Find the primary source to verify the data you find online or in news stories. Find the researcher responsible for compiling a dataset in a document or study, Rhodes advised. Call an expert, or two or three, especially when you\u2019re not sure about the validity of the data, Lupkin of NPR advised. **4. Don\u2019t let perfection be the enemy of good** Sometimes you won\u2019t be able to get a comprehensive database, but you can access parts of it. And that part can \u201cgive you a window in, even if it isn\u2019t a complete picture,\u201d Lupkin said. Be sure to describe the data in your story and explain its limitations. When Lupkin learned that the drug list price database was proprietary and not available to her, she sought out other companies that pay to access those datasets. One of those companies was GoodRx. The company provided Lupkin with a set of data that didn\u2019t violate itsuser agreementwith the owners of the original datasets. Ask yourself the following questions when looking for data, Lupkin advised: If it\u2019s not the original company, who else might have access to the data? Who else might collect it? Who else does something similar? Are there any government, academic or think tank reports that suggest this data exists? Who else would benefit from or need this data? If it\u2019s federal data, is it possible that it could also be held in a state database? While the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services hashospital inspection reports, so do states. So instead of filing a records request via the Freedom of Information Act with CMS, which might have taken months to fulfill, Lupkin filed one with a state and got what she needed in a week. \u201cSometimes knowing that there\u2019s a redundancy of the thing that you want can help you get around the problem,\u201d of getting the data, she said. **5. Use advanced search techniques** Boolean operators (words like AND, OR, NOT), filetype filters, and site-specific searches on Google\u2019sAdvanced Searchcan help you find documents that may not show up with a simple Google search. For instance, if you\u2019re looking for a database of injuries from a government website, you can type in Google\u2019s search box \u201cinjuries site:gov filetype:csv,\u201d Rhodes said. (A CSV, orComma-Separated Valuesfile, is a simple, plain text file format to store data that can be easily imported into a spreadsheet program.) Online search expert Hank van Ess hasseveral tipson optimizing Google searches. Lupkin and Rhodes also shared the following tools: To track changes to a website Fluxguard(formerly Versionista) ChangeDetection FollowThatPage To search for academic research Google Scholar Base-Search.net OpenAIRE JournalTOCs Digital Commons Network SSRN Tools for archiving and organizing content Webrecorder.io: records the content of a web page Archive.is: web page archiver Chrono download manager: download all files on a page Zotero: a free organizing tool Multy: creates a shareable list of links Other free tools Tabula: extracts tables from PDFs Pinpoint: transcribes audio and video, explores and analyzes large collections of documents Beautiful Soup4: scrapes websites. **6. Pregame your FOIA research** A FOIA request is an official way to seek access to government records under the Freedom of Information Act, which took effect in 1967. But not every request for government data needs to start with formal paperwork. \u201cMy advice is always to see what you can get [by saying], \u2018Hey, I\u2019m really interested in this. I know you keep it. Can I get it?\u2019\u201d Rhodes said. \u201cA well-meaning email goes a long way, especially in the climate that we\u2019re in right now.\u201d The dataset you want might have already been requested and paid for, which means you won\u2019t need to start your request from scratch. The requests are usually captured on the agencies\u2019 FOIA logs, which are lists of FOIA requests filed with government agencies. For instance, you can find the FOIA logs for theFood and Drug Administrationand theDepartment of Homeland Security. FOIA logs aren\u2019t always posted online, even though in the past it was standard practice, Rhodes wrote in an email after the panel. So if you can\u2019t find the FOIA logs on a federal website, they\u2019ve probably been taken down from public view, but you can still file a FOIA for them, Rhodes wrote. You can do the same for state and local government agencies if their FOIA logs are not posted online. Another great resource for FIOA requests isMuckRock, a nonprofit, collaborative news site and a \u201crepository of hundreds of thousands of pages of original government materials, information on how to file requests and tools to make the requesting process easier,\u201d according to its website. **7. Leverage SEC filings to uncover business data** When data is unavailable due to corporate secrecy, check public companies\u2019 earnings reports and filings on theU.S. Securities and Exchange Commissionwebsite. SEC filings are financial statements and other regulatory documents that public companies are required to submit to the SEC. The filings sometimes reveal contract disputes, pricing strategies or blame-shifting. \u201cIf something is going wrong, and it reaches the level that somebody has to tell their investors about [it], you might find more information [in the SEC filings],\u201d Lupkin said. **8. Use administrative data when possible** Administrative data \u2014 the digital record of various types of services that are provided by government agencies and public or private organizations \u2014 can be an imperfect but useful fallback as other data disappears, said Radley of the Center for Evidence-Based Policy. One example is data from health insurance claims, Radley wrote in an email following the panel. \u201cAnalysts (like me) can ask for that data to do research on the kinds of health care services that get provided,\u201d Radley wrote. There are other types of administrative data. One of Radley\u2019s projects \u2014 theOregon Child Integrated Dataset\u2014 uses administrative data from the state\u2019s juvenile justice system, showing when kids have contact with the system, including dates, locations, type of offense and disciplinary action, Radley wrote. Administrative datasets aren\u2019t easy to access because they\u2019re always owned by an agency or company. Many times, the data includes private individual information or proprietary information like drug prices. \u201cGenerally, to get access, you need to identify the data owner, make a request, demonstrate you have the ability to keep the data secure, etc.,\u201d Radley wrote. \u201cAll of these things are specified in a legally binding Data Use Agreement.\u201d \u201cStill, the reason why I think [administrative] data will be even more important is that it will continue to be generated, even when other federal data collection (e.g., survey) is being scaled back,\u201d he wrote. \u201cFully leveraging this type of data will require new and closer collaboration between researchers and journalists.\u201d **About The Author** Know Your ResearchTip sheets and explainers to help journalists understand academic research methods, find and recognize high-quality research, investigate scientific misconduct and research errors, and avoid missteps when reporting on new studies and public opinion polls **Email Newsletter** Subscribe.
