Metaphorically, Thomas Jefferson University president Susan C. Aldridge, PhD, has an amazing vista around her. Founded in 1824 as one of the nation\u2019s first medical schools, the first to open a clinic for the poor, and in 1884 the first Textile School in the U.S., her institution enables her to view a 200-year legacy of leadership in higher education, research, clinical care and community engagement. Turning 180 degrees, Aldridge, the leader of one of the nation\u2019s most innovative and effective institutions of profession-focused higher education, envisions Jefferson\u2019s path forward, mapping out its opportunities and responsibilities to be a model for preparing graduates for career-long success in the dynamic, 21st century. At this historical pivot point, Jefferson today is a national doctoral research university with 10 colleges and more than 200 academic programs. It\u2019s also a powerhouse of research discovery, translation and application, scholarship and clinical investigation. Aldridge is exactly the right leader at the right time. An accomplished higher education executive, strategist and futurist, she previously served as president of the University of Maryland Global Campus, president of Drexel University Online, and vice chancellor of Troy University. She was a member of the Jefferson Board of Trustees when she accepted appointment as interim president in June 2023, and was formally named president a year later. \u201cPeople have asked me why I took on a university presidency at this time, when higher education is experiencing tectonic shifts that are shaking the foundations of hundreds of colleges and universities,\u201d Aldridge said. \u201cMy answer is this: Our goal at Jefferson is to redefine \u2018possible,\u2019 and that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s called for in higher education today. The world desperately needs what our institutions are best-positioned to offer: New knowledge and the capacity to prepare the skilled and adaptable workforce required to apply that knowledge \u2014 enabling them to help solve complex, thorny global challenges.\u201d A Focus on the Future The post-World War II model of higher education served well for many decades, Aldridge observed, and its graduates drove extraordinary advances in the life and physical sciences, engineering, architecture, design, medicine and public health and biomedical research. \u201cBut that model is untenable in this century,\u201d she explained. \u201cToday, universities must be flexible and innovative, creative and courageous. We must stay aligned with society\u2019s evolving needs \u2014 ensuring that our graduates have the kinds of knowledge, skills and personal capacities they need to succeed for decades to come.\u201d Judging by some key metrics, Jefferson is doing just that. In the first year after earning their bachelor\u2019s degree, 97% of Jefferson graduates are employed in their field or have been accepted to graduate school. Unlike most U.S. colleges and universities, Jefferson\u2019s admissions are growing and it\u2019s been launching new degree programs. Aldridge attributes its student-success rates and program growth to the university\u2019s future-focused and award-winning model for educating professionals, its commitment to pedagogical innovation that leverages both new technologies and the science of cognition and learning, and to dedicated faculty who excel in both their classrooms and their professions. Jefferson has another advantage. It\u2019s one of the few multifaceted universities closely allied with a major academic health system and a non-profit health insurer. \u201cThe close relationship between the university, Jefferson Health and Jefferson Health Plans creates myriad opportunities for students\u2019 hands-on engagement in professional activities and research,\u201d Aldridge explained. \u201cThose opportunities are not just in biomedical disciplines, they extend to students in fields ranging from industrial and textile design to arts and humanities to business and public policy.\u201d Leveraging AI in Higher Education Having previously led the development of global online programs at two major universities, Aldridge has deep experience in guiding higher education\u2019s adaptation to \u2014 and adoption of \u2014 major technology shifts. Now, she is a thought leader on how best to integrate computational science, machine learning and artificial intelligence into universities\u2019 curriculum, teaching and overall operations. \u201cAt Jefferson, we work hard to make sure our graduates are prepared for the future of work in an era of \u2014 I\u2019ll call it \u2014 ubiquitous computation,\u201d she explained. \u201cWe want them to be facile and comfortable working with new technological resources like AI; and teach them to balance technologies\u2019 strengths and weaknesses by applying empathy, creativity, intuition and human caring.\u201d The university has also created resources that help faculty and researchers learn about and make best use of emerging computational science applications and technologies. Those include, for example, the AI and Deep Learning Networks Program and the AI Center of Excellence, which help faculty create novel content through machine learning. \u201cBut those are just down payments on what we know, intuitively, there will need to be a significant, long-term investment in new technical capacities and resources,\u201d Aldridge noted. In the near future, Jefferson will also launch new academic programs in general computation and data analysis and in discipline-specific areas such as computational biology. \u201cWe are also adding teaching on specific data-based capacities to a range of courses where computation may not previously have been relevant \u2014 capacities such as creating multimodal large language models and using prompt engineering to shape Generative AI models in real time.\u201d As a thought leader, Aldridge is also asking her peers this provocative question:How best can we proactively guide AI\u2019s use in higher education and shape its impact on our students, faculty and institution \u2014 instead of just passively reacting to what comes next? She believes the answer requires pursuing several specific objectives. \u201cFirst, we must ensure that across our curriculum we are preparing today\u2019s students to use AI in their careers \u2014 in particular, to add human-skills value that enables them to succeed in parallel with employers\u2019 expanded use of AI. Second, we need to employ AI-based capacities to enhance the effectiveness of the education we deliver to our students \u2014 and to strengthen their capacity for meaningful, lifelong learning. Third, we must employ AI to address specific pedagogical and administrative challenges, ranging from improving learning outcomes to maintaining our campus facilities.\u201d Moving Forward Achieving those objectives \u2014 alongside dealing with the slew of other challenges universities are grappling with these days \u2014 will not be easy. Which leads back to the question Aldridge is frequently asked: Why take on such an enormous task? \u201cThis is a pivotal point in time for both higher education and a university, like ours, that possesses unique characteristics, strengths and opportunities,\u201d she observed. \u201cJefferson\u2019s mission of improving lives compels us to both positively impact the people, communities and those our graduates will serve, and help improve the quality of higher education and healthcare delivery for generations to come. \u201cGiven that context, how could I not be excited about this role and the opportunity it presents to help shape the future?\u201d Facebook Twitter Email Want a digest of WHYY\u2019s programs, events & stories?Sign up for our weekly newsletter.
