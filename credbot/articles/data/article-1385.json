Copy link Share on Facebook Share on Bluesky Share on X Share on LinkedIn Share on WhatsApp To suppress protestsagainst his deportation agenda, President Donald Trump took an extraordinary action on Saturday by calling up 2,000 National Guard troops to tamp down demonstrations in California. In doing so, he exercised rarely used federal powers, bypassed the authority of the state\u2019s governor, Gavin Newsom, and set the stage for violent confrontation. Newsom, a Democrat,saidthe soldiers were unneeded and would only \u201cescalate tensions.\u201d Trump\u2019s order came after protests broke out on Friday and continued through Saturday as federal agents searched Los Angeles\u2019s garment district and other neighborhoods for undocumented immigrant workers. More protests are planned for Sunday afternoon. Any demonstration impeding immigration law enforcement would be considered a \u201cform of rebellion,\u201daccording to Trump. \u201cIf Governor Gavin Newscum, of California, and Mayor Karen Bass, of Los Angeles, can\u2019t do their jobs, which everyone knows they can\u2019t, then the Federal Government will step in and solve the problem, RIOTS & LOOTERS, the way it should be solved!!!\u201d Trumppostedto his Truth Social account, using his childish moniker for Newsom. The Trump administration\u2019s move to further insert the military into domestic political and law enforcement activities carries immense risk. Militarizing an already tense situation increases the likelihood of civilian harm, threatens to chill civil liberties, and could irreparably damage civil\u2013military relations. The White House did not respond to questions about the potential for escalating tensions, worries about violence, or whether Trump would take personal responsibility for any resulting casualties. **Most Read** The National Guardhas, at times, been tapped to stifle dissent. In 2020, Trump requested that the governors of multiple states deploy their National Guard troops to Washington, D.C., to suppress protests afterMinneapolis police killed George Floyd. Many governors agreed, and thousands of troops from 11 states were deployed to D.C. In 1992, President George H.W. Bush sent National Guard troops to Los Angeles to quell riots after police officers wereacquitted in the beating of Rodney King. That deployment was requested by California\u2019s then-Gov. Pete Wilson. The Guard was federalized during the New York postal strike in 1970, following the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968, and during the 1967 Detroit uprising. Presidents Dwight Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy, and Lyndon Johnson used the National Guard to help enforce civil rights during the 1950s and 1960s. But it is the 1970 deployment of the National Guard to crack down on anti-war protests in Kent, Ohio, that best illustrates the danger of involving the military in civilian law enforcement. \u201cAt times, their response has degenerated into uncontrolled violence.\u201d That April, President Richard M. Nixon expanded the Vietnam War byinvading neighboring Cambodia, supercharging the anti-war movement. In Kent, protests in response led to vandalism and prompted Republican Gov. James Rhodes to deploy the Ohio National Guard. On May 4, Guardsmen opened fire on antiwar protesters at Kent State University, firing 67 rounds over a period of just 13 seconds, killing four students \u2014 Allison Krause, Jeffrey Miller, Sandra Scheuer, and William Knox Schroeder \u2014 and wounding nine others. The unrest that followed was unprecedented in American history. A national student strike involving more than1 million studentsat 450 colleges and universities followed. Close to 90 percent of campuses saw protests in the month after the Kent State killings, with4 millionparticipating. This included atJackson State College(now University) in Mississippi, where city and state police opened fire on student protesters and passersby on May 15, wounding 12 and killing law student Phillip Lafayette Gibbs and 17-year-old high school student James Earl Green. Nixon\u2019s own Commission on Campus Unrest, established in the wake of the killings at Kent State and Jackson State, found that student discontent was fueled by the Vietnam War and exacerbated by officials. \u201cActions and inactions of government at all levels have contributed to campus unrest. The words of some political leaders have helped to inflame it. Law enforcement officers have too often reacted ineptly or overreacted,\u201d according to the report. \u201cAt times, their response has degenerated into uncontrolled violence.\u201d Trump\u2019s activation of the California National Guard is the first time a president has done so without a request from a state\u2019s governor since 1965, when President Lyndon B. Johnson sent troops to Alabama to protect civil rights demonstrators. **Related** **Federal Agents at Protests Renew Calls to Dismantle Homeland Security** **Related** **Federal Agents at Protests Renew Calls to Dismantle Homeland Security** During his first term in office, Trumpsuggested shooting protesters to quell dissent, according to his former secretary of defense, Mark Esper. \u201cThe president was enraged,\u201d Esper recalled, amid the strife following George Floyd\u2019s murder in 2020. \u201cHe thought that the protests made the country look weak, made us look weak and \u2018us\u2019 meant him.\u201d Esper said that Trump looked to the chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley and said, \u201c\u2019Can\u2019t you just shoot them, just shoot them in the legs or something?\u2019\u201d Esper characterized it as \u201ca suggestion and a formal question.\u201d During the last presidential campaign, Trump promised he would crack down on protests with troops. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to not be involved in that, you just have to be asked by the governor or the mayor to come in \u2014 the next time, I\u2019m not waiting,\u201dhe said. **We\u2019re independent of corporate interests \u2014 and powered by members.

Some activists blocked traffic and confronted federal agents. Others slashed tires and defaced buildings, according to theDepartment of Homeland Security. Many carried signs, shouted in protest and kept their distance from federal officers. Law enforcement responded by hurling tear gas canisters and flash-bang grenades, and firingrubber bulletsat demonstrators. \u201cThey threw rocks at the officers,\u201d said Bill Essayli, the interim U.S. attorney for the Central District of California. \u201cWe had Molotov cocktails thrown. We had all kinds of assaults on agents. The state has an obligation to maintain order and maintain public safety, and they\u2019re unable to do that right now in Los Angeles. So the federal government will send in resources to regain order.\u201d California\u2019s attorney general, Rob Bonta, said local law enforcement did not require federal assistance. \u201cThere is no emergency and the President\u2019s order calling in the National Guard is unnecessary and counterproductive,\u201d hepostedon X. At least 20 people were arrested on Saturday, mostly in Paramount, in addition to the more than 100 people arrested at the protests on Friday, according to Essayli. As a third day of protests loomed, Trump issued asocial media rantthat took aim at Newsom, \u201cRadical Left protests,\u201d and mask-wearing demonstrators. He thanked the \u201cNational Guard for a job well done!\u201d It was unclear what job the troops, who had not yet been seen on the streets, had done when Trump posted the comments on Sunday at 2:41 a.m. The White House did not respond to a request for clarification. White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said in astatementon Saturday night that Trump was deploying the National Guard in response to \u201cviolent mobs.\u201d The 2,000 troops would \u201caddress the lawlessness that has been allowed to fester,\u201dshe said. Newsom rebuked the president\u2019s order. \u201cThat move is purposefully inflammatory and will only escalate tensions,\u201dhe said, adding that \u201cthis is the wrong mission and will erode public trust.\u201d Copy link Share on Facebook Share on Bluesky Share on X Share on LinkedIn Share on WhatsApp IT\u2019S EVEN WORSE THAN WE THOUGHT. What we\u2019re seeing right now from Donald Trump is a full-on authoritarian takeover of the U.S. government. This is not hyperbole. Court orders are being ignored. MAGA loyalists have been put in charge of the military and federal law enforcement agencies. The Department of Government Efficiency has stripped Congress of its power of the purse. News outlets that challenge Trump have been banished or put under investigation. Yet far too many are still covering Trump\u2019s assault on democracy like politics as usual, with flattering headlines describing Trump as \u201cunconventional,\u201d \u201ctesting the boundaries,\u201d and \u201caggressively flexing power.\u201d The Intercept has long covered authoritarian governments, billionaire oligarchs, and backsliding democracies around the world. We understand the challenge we face in Trump and the vital importance of press freedom in defending democracy. **We\u2019re independent of corporate interests.
