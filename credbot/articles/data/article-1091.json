Yet, Smith admits the team this year, while wanting to run the ball more efficiently, will have a more natural focus on passing the football. In his words, they did not make these moves to go out there and run the Wishbone, which is a popular formation that includes a running quarterback and two running backs and a fullback. \u201cYou don\u2019t bring Aaron (Rodgers) in here and sign DK (Metcalf) for all that money to go run the Wishbone.\u201d Rodgers had 28 touchdowns to 11 interceptions in 2024. He went just 5-12 in his starts with the Jets, and even after they acquired Davante Adams, went just 3-8. It was a tough season for Rodgers, who also had multiple leg injuries. The Steelers think something remains in the tank for the former four-time MVP. They zeroed in on him as their target, as a result, especially after missing on re-signingJustin Fields. Now, Rodgers will be with the Steelers on a deal that will not break the bank, and could still land them another wide receiver to help Rodgers. Even at this stage of his career, with things on the downswing, Rodgers\u2019 offenses still have a ton of spread personnel and will focus on passing the ball heavily. It seems that could indicate a shift for the Steelers in their philosophy with the explosive playmakers they have. **More Pittsburgh Steelers News** Pittsburgh Steelers lowballing teams in trade talks for a top playmaker, insider says Arthur Smith fires back at supposed drama between himself and Russell Wilson: \u2018Fantastical narrative\u2019 Top free agent wide receiver not interested in playing for Steelers: \u2018Pittsburgh?
