That doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t be useful. Share This essay is a response to **The 28th** Mark Stasenko Related Video **Criminal Justice, Automation, and Trust: An Interview With Mark Stasenko** The emerging applications of artificial intelligence promise huge social benefits: significant gains indetecting breast cancerthat allow radiologists to focus on other patient needs, the deciphering of text inside a 2,000-year-old scorched scrollso carbonized that it cannot be unrolled, the development of new drugs through 3Dprotein structure prediction, and so on. But there are perils too, as ordinary people, especially low-income Americans, can attest to: AI systems that, usually with little explanation,deny home loans, set predatoryrent prices, and rejectemployment applications, to name a few. Yet nowhere is the use of AI as fraught as it is in the criminal justice system, where adverse decisions lead to starkly life-altering outcomes. This isn\u2019t a hypothetical future concern: criminal justice automation of varying degrees has already arrived. Local police agencies can turn topredictive technologiesto help direct patrol resources and evengenerate police reports. A number of jurisdictions userisk assessment toolsto decide who should be detained pretrial. Others permit judges to usealgorithmic toolsto determine criminal sentences. Parole boards can rely onautomated assessmentsto identify who should be eligible for parole. So AI is already present in the criminal justice system. But how far should it go? In his Future Tense Fiction story \u201cThe 28th,\u201d Mark Stasenko asks us to take the next logical step. What if automated systems weren\u2019t just guides, but replacements for nearly every human in the process\u2014including forensic analysts, defense attorneys, prosecutors, and even juries? In Stasenko\u2019s provocative thought experiment, there are still human detectives engaged in investigations, but even they are under AI supervision, and almost every other criminal justice process has been delegated to AI agents. The detectives\u2019 AI partner, Sybil, isn\u2019t just a guide; \u201cshe\u201d is a mandatory taskmaster, now backed up with the legal authority of a constitutional amendment. What would a world of nearly totally automated criminal cases look like\u2014a Siri with coercive power? What would a world of nearly totally automated criminal cases look like? Most technologists, scholars, and civil rights advocates today would balk at the idea, and rightly so. The incursion of AI into the criminal justice system has already brought with it a series of controversies and problems. Predictive policing, touted in2011as one of the best inventions of the year and widely praised in the early 2010s, became so associated with hidden bias andinaccuracythat some citieseventually banned it. Automated gunshot detection software promises to revolutionize police resource allocation, but it turns out to be plagued witherrors and inefficiencies. Facial recognition technologies might seem like a foolproof method of identification, until you hear the stories ofRobert Julian-Borchak Williamsand others who have been wrongfully arrested on the basis of faulty matches. The underlying premise of \u201cThe 28th,\u201d as is often the case with the most perceptive speculative fiction, seems entirely plausible. So disillusioned with the criminal justice system and its traditional, human-centered processes, the public backs a constitutional amendment to do away with juries of one\u2019s peers in criminal trials. The goal is to rid the system of humans\u2019 implicit biases and misguided emotion. The story\u2019s detectives, Alex and Elijah, work notwithbutforAI agents that analyze data, direct police work, process cases, and deliver verdicts. In the story, we see that each detective stands at seemingly opposing ends of the spectrum of responses to AI: Alex opts for blind trust, Elijah for rejection. Neither one is realistic or advisable. Each detective stands at seemingly opposing ends of the spectrum of responses to AI: Alex opts for blind trust, Elijah for rejection. Neither one is realistic or advisable. Elijah\u2019s complete rejection of an AI-driven system, based on his nostalgic yearning for \u201cintuitive\u201d police work, papers over the many flaws of traditional policing and ignores the technological revolutions around him. The datafied world today requires some degree of automation to process the sheer amount of information out there; policing must adapt like every other institution in society. And as Elijah\u2019s interventions\u2014which I won\u2019t spoil here\u2014suggest, there is every reason to be skeptical of the \u201cgood old days\u201d of human manipulation, bad faith, and error. Alex\u2019s unquestioning faith, for its part, is ill-conceived for different reasons. When he loses his wife to human error, he embraces all that an AI system promises because it appears to be everything that humans are not. For Alex, AI \u201celiminated\u201d the \u201ctype of human error\u201d that led to his wife\u2019s death. But Alex fails to see that AI systems aren\u2019t handed down by some infallible divinity; they are created by flawed human beings. Even worse, the workings of his AI partner Sybil\u2019s judgments are opaque. We can\u2019t know how Sybil resolves any criminal case because the process is hidden within a \u201cblack box.\u201d The story\u2019s 28th Amendment may have eliminated our own Sixth Amendment, but if due process is still a part of the future, defendants should shudder at the lack of transparency in the process. There are other troubling aspects of Stasenko\u2019s useful thought experiment. Sybil is not a government-created entity; these AI agents are produced by a private company whose own interests are presumably inclined toward market dominance and corporate secrecy, not public transparency or accountability. Sybil may be the dominant AI in criminal justice because she is the best program available\u2014or because, as the story hints, her creators are the most politically savvy. Similar issues have already cropped up in our world. Some criminal defendants have beenbarred from accessing the algorithmsused to convict them because private companies have invokedtrade secret entitlements. Sybil\u2019s creators may have few incentives to disclose the technology\u2019s inner workings. That scenario feels far from just. Alex realizes the follies of his blind faith in Sybil in the worst possible way: when he is unjustly accused of murder. And Elijah, the person who frees Alex from his AI-dictated fate, harbors his own flawed motivations. So what\u2019s a rational person to do? None of these extremes will do when it comes to the future of AI in the criminal justice system. Part of the answer lies in verbal cues Stasenko has left within the story: the related concepts of faith and fate. Faith is what leaves Alex blind to Sybil\u2019s faults. It is the loss of faith in the criminal justice system that led to the 28th Amendment. The fate of a defendant, once left to a human jury, is handed over to an all-encompassing AI agent. None of these extremes will do when it comes to the future of AI in the criminal justice system. Some AI tools will be beneficial to the criminal justice system, so long as there is oversight and accountability. As petabytes of police bodycam videos become the norm, for example,generative AI technologiescan help already overburdened public defense attorneys review the data for their clients. Policymakers must take the middle path when it comes to applying new technologies in the service of criminal justice: to weigh costs and benefits, to foregroundhuman values like due process and justice, and to abjure any notion that AI will provide a solution to a system createdbypeople that makes decisions of enormous consequenceforpeople. And sometimes, society needs to say no. No to Sybil. Unfortunately, political support for such restraintmay have receded. But one thing is clear: As \u201cThe 28th\u201d warns us, AI is a tool, not an answer. **About the Author** Elizabeth Johis the Martin Luther King Jr. Professor of Law at the University of California Davis School of Law.
