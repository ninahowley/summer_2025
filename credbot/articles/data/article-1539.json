Orange County\u2019s air quality is the worst in the United States\u2014and our children are paying the price. Alongside Los Angeles and Long Beach, our region consistently ranks worst in the nation for ozone pollution, according to the American Lung Association, which gives us afailinggrade year after year. As pediatricians, we see firsthand how air pollution damages pediatric lungs \u2014 by triggering asthma exacerbations, causing missed school days for children, and increasing children\u2019s susceptibility to viral and bacterial pneumonias. The root of many of these issues is the polluted air in Orange County. Fortunately in the next few weeks, we have an amazing opportunity for change! On June 6, the South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) will vote on new standards that target one of the region\u2019s most dangerous and overlooked sources of air pollution: the gas-powered water heaters and furnaces inside our homes. What happens at this meeting will determine the future health of our children. Indoor air pollution affects pediatric lungs, and poor indoor air quality leads to poor pediatric health. The gas appliances we use hide in plain sight\u2014yet they produceseven times more smog-forming nitrogen oxide (NOx) pollutionthan the region\u2019s power plants. The longer we keep using gas appliances, the longer our children will suffer disproportionately worse health compared to other regions. Burning fossil fuels in homes and buildings contributes to anestimated 76,000 asthma attacks, 30,000 missed school days, 130 premature deaths, and $2 billion in health-related costs each year. Those aren\u2019t just statistics\u2014they\u2019re our children. These are the kids growing up in our neighborhoods who deserve a chance to thrive without having their growing lungs strained by dirty air. They are the kids coming to our pediatric clinics with worsening health. In Orange County alone,40,000 children and 219,000 adults live with asthma. These numbers should alarm every parent\u2014and every policymaker. But these health impacts go far beyond asthma. Air pollution affects adult patients as well by exacerbating heart disease, lung disease, and pregnancy complications. Here\u2019s what the SCAQMD rules would do: Starting in 2027, manufacturers would need to ensure that 30% of the water heaters and furnaces they sell are zero-emission models, such as electric heat pumps. That percentage would gradually increase to 90% by 2036. Companies that don\u2019t meet the targets would pay a compliance fee to fund the Go Zero program, which provides rebates and installation support to help families and small businesses upgrade to clean, non-polluting options. From local politics to the people and policies shaping our daily lives\u2014it\u2019s all in The Morning Report. Don\u2019t miss out on this free daily email. \u0394 These upgrades won\u2019t just clean up our air\u2014they\u2019ll actually save families money! Heat pumps, which provide both heating and cooling in one system, are far more energy-efficient than gas-powered appliances. For households that already use central air and are on electrification-friendly utility rates, switching to heat pumps can cut utility bills by around$370 a year! Over time, those savings add up\u2014putting money back into parents\u2019 pockets while reducing pollution in our neighborhoods. Despite these public health and financial benefits, many Orange County elected officials oppose these common sense standards. According toVoice of OCreporting, local leaders in cities like Anaheim, Huntington Beach, and Yorba Linda have passed resolutions opposing the SCAQMD\u2019s proposed rules. As practicing pediatricians, we are disheartened. Rather than championing cleaner air and healthier futures, some local leaders are choosing to maintain the status quo\u2014a status quo that leaves children and our OC families bearing a disproportionate burden of poor lung health. Orange County lags behind other areas on health and environmental policy.26 of our 34 cities have no Climate Action Plan, leaving residents more vulnerable to extreme heat, poor air, and environmental injustice. These appliance standards offer a step forward\u2014but they\u2019ll only work if we let them. Polluted air is not normal and we can do better for our children and community. We have the tools to fix it, namely passing the proposed SCAQMD rules. The SCAQMD\u2019s vote on June 6 is more than a policy decision. It\u2019s a clinical decision. Will our community continue to allow OC\u2019s children to breathe harmful air so outdated gas appliances can stay in use? Or will we take this opportunity to build a cleaner, healthier future? We urge the SCAQMD to vote yes on these standards. We urge our OC neighbors and leaders to stand up for clean air and public health. Our kids\u2019 pulmonary health depends on it.
