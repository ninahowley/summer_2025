A New York judge has thrown out Justin Baldoni\u2019s jaw-droppingR7.52 billiondefamation lawsuit against Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds. This dismissal handed Lively a decisive legal victory, sending shockwaves through Hollywood and beyond. **JUDGE DISMISSES LAWSUIT** The ruling, delivered by Judge Lewis J. Liman on Monday, marks the latest dramatic twist in a bitter feud that has gripped the entertainment world. Baldoni, best known for his role inJane the Virgin, had accused Lively and Reynolds of orchestrating a plot to \u201cruin\u201d him and his career. This was after a fallout on the set ofIt Ends With Us, a film they both starred in, according toVariety. The lawsuit, which also targeted Lively\u2019s publicist andThe New York Times, claimed that Lively\u2019s allegations of sexual harassment were false and part of a calculated smear campaign. **LAWSUIT DETAILS** Judge Liman did not accept the claims. He ruled that Lively legally protected her accusations, which she first made in a formal complaint and later shared with the media. \u201cThe claims were covered by litigation privilege, which means they can\u2019t be the basis for a defamation suit,\u201d Liman ruled. He also dismissed Baldoni\u2019s claims of extortion and other allegedwrongdoings, saying the evidence simply didn\u2019t stack up. **BLAKE LIVELY\u2019S TEAM REJOICE** Lively\u2019s legal team celebrated the outcome. \u201cToday\u2019s ruling is a complete triumph and full vindication for Blake Lively. It\u2019s also a victory for those whom Justin Baldoni and the Wayfarer Parties dragged into theirretaliatorylawsuit, including Ryan Reynolds, Leslie Sloane andThe New York Times,\u201d they declared. \u201cFrom the outset, we maintained that this \u2018R7.52 billion\u2019lawsuit was a farce, and the Court recognised that. We are eager for the next phase, which involves seeking attorneys\u2019 fees, triple damages, and punitive damages against Baldoni and others who engaged in this abusive litigation\u201d. **BLAKE LIVELY ON WOMEN\u2019S RIGHTS** Lively herself took to Instagram, thanking the 19 women\u2019s rights organisations that supported her. \u201cI stood proudly with 19 organisations defending women\u2019s rights to speak up for their safety,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWhile the suit against me was defeated, so many don\u2019t have the resources to fight back\u201d. The legal fireworks are far from over. Lively is still suing Baldoni and his production company for sexual harassment and retaliation, with a trial set for March 2026. **BALDONI CAN STILL REFILE** Meanwhile, the judge has given Baldoni until 23 June to try again. He can amend and refile a couple of claims about interference with contracts, but the heart of hisR7.52 billioncase is dead in the water. With both sides vowing to keep fighting, this blockbuster legal drama is far from its final act. **DO YOU THINK THE JUDGE MADE THE RIGHT DECISION IN DISMISSING THE CASE?** Let us know by leaving a comment below, or send a WhatsApp to060 011 021 1.
