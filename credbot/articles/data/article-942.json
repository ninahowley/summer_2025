He is now facing a felony charge of conspiracy to impede an officer with the the Los Angeles native\u2019s detention the latest example of how organized labor is being hit hard from the raids by masked ICE agents. Not only is the Trump administration not going after the employers of undocumented labor, but it is instead targeting union members whowerelegally living and working in the US. Team Trump is doing so bycancelling humanitarian parole,revoking the visasof many graduate student union members, and other ICE actions that target individuals in the wrong place at the wrong time with the wrong skin color and potentially the wrong outlook on capital-labor relations. Unions are increasingly sounding the alarm that the ICE agents snatching people off the street is part of the administration\u2019s wider crackdown on organized labor. The AFL-CIO\u2019s Department of People Who Work for a Living (DPWL) recently held a series of hearings across the country to provide a platform for working people and local communities to express their views on the current administration\u2019s policies. Summarized in thisreport, they argue that the Trump administration\u2019s mass deportation program, with its disregard for due process, threatens the constitutional rights of every worker and poses serious disruptions in key industries and local economies. Let\u2019s take a look at what they\u2019re saying and how this is playing out. Far from focusing immigration enforcement efforts on people who pose a public safety risk, Trump has taken active steps to strip status and work authorization away from millions of working people,many of whom have been members of our workforce and our unions for decades. These enormous populations have all had their status terminated and are now fighting in the courts to preserve their ability to live and work here: Nearly 1 million workers with Temporary Protected Status due to unsafe conditions in Afghanistan, Cameroon, Haiti and Venezuela. More than 1.5 million workers with Humanitarian Parole (an unfortunately named form of protection that has nothing to do with the criminal justice system) who were invited here with sponsors from Afghanistan, Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela. More than 1.5 million workers with Humanitarian Parole (an unfortunately named form of protection that has nothing to do with the criminal justice system) who were invited here with sponsors from Afghanistan, Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela. More than 1.5 million workers with Humanitarian Parole (an unfortunately named form of protection that has nothing to do with the criminal justice system) who were invited here with sponsors from Afghanistan, Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela. Note that all these countries have in recent years\u2014and in some cases, dating back much further\u2014been on the receiving end of US invasions, \u201ccounterterrorism\u201d operations, sanctions, regime change efforts, and other modes of violence and plunder. In return, some lucky few get to live the American dream working long hours for low pay and have had the temerity to try to better their lot by joining unions here in the US. Their reward? Like our federal workforce, hundreds of thousands of these immigrant workers received notice through harshly worded form letters that their status, and therefore their ability to work, was being terminated. Some were given as few as seven days to pack up and leave the country, and told that failure to do so would result in criminal prosecution.64 These callous terminations are effectively resulting in mass layoffs of workers across the country, causing massive disruptions in key industries, local economies and union membership. Larger Plan at Work Whilemilitarized ICE agents sweeping into communities across the country might appease some of Trump\u2019s MAGA supporters and provide the illusion of doing something about the exploitation of foreign workers, a closer look shows that it is part of a coordinated attack on all of labor. How so? Let\u2019s start with Donald himself and go from there. Trump\u2019s businesses rely on andcontinue to seekH-2B non-agricultural \u201cguest\u201d workers. A crucial difference between the H-2B and H-2A\u2014covering agricultural workers\u2014and individuals who worked in the US under temporary protected status or humanitarian parole is that the latter two categories didn\u2019t have their ability to stay in the country legally tied to their work. That made them less exploitable. They were free to change jobs and unionize. Guest workers, on the other hand, are loved by Trump and many employers because they are basically indentured servants. Even the Departments of Labor and Homeland Security\u201cacknowledgethat H-2B workers face structural disincentives to reporting or leaving abusive conditions, and often lack power to exercise their rights in the face of exploitative employment situations.\u201d H2-A guest workers also faced a major setback in their fight to organize last year when a District Court Judge issued aninjunctionin August that blocked them from unionizing in 17 states. Meanwhile, the guest worker program featureslabor trafficking, and rampant wage fraud, illegal recruitment fees, wage theft, and illegalthreats of retaliation. Abuse ismade easyby the fact that it\u2019s almost impossible for workers to quit their jobs since their visas are tied to a single employer. Mike Rios, a DOL regional agricultural enforcement coordinator,describesthe H2 program as the \u201cliteral purchase of humans.\u201d As of 2024 there were 384,900 H2-A and 215,217 H2-B workers in the US. About 40 percent of U.S. farmworkersare undocumented, and as of 2020 there were more than 406,000 individuals with Temporary Protected Status, which allows them to reside and work legally in the US due to unsafe conditions in their home country. The similar humanitarian parole covered another 530,000-plus. Trump is trying to end Temporary Protected Status, and on May 30 the Supreme Courtallowedthe administration to pause humanitarian parole. Notably, Trump and his ICE goons are not going after H2 workers, but they are targeting those who try to organize them. In March, ICE agents smashed his car window and detained Alfredo \u201cLelo\u201d Juarez, who began working as a berry picker at the age 14 and helped foundFamilias Unidas Por La Justicia, an independent farmworker union in Washington State. He advocated around issues like overtime pay, heat protections for farmworkers and criticized the exploitative nature of theH-2A program. A Seattle immigration judge had ordered Juarez Zeferino\u2019s removal in 2018. Edgar Franks, the political director of Familias Unidas,tells Truthoutthat the view from the ground makes the Trump administration\u2019s aims fairly obvious. It\u2019s not about ridding the country of immigrant workers nor even prioritizing the white working class. It\u2019s about making all of labor more easily exploitable: It was meant to silence the organizing, deport as many people as possible, and to bring in a captive workforce through the H-2A program. We think that might be the ultimate plan: to get rid of all the immigrant workers who are organizing and fighting back for better conditions, and to bring in a workforce that\u2019s under the complete control of their employer with basically no rights. It\u2019ll make it even harder to organize with farmworkers if more H-2A workers come. It wouldn\u2019t be impossible, but it\u2019ll be more difficult. A White House official told NBC News that Trump wants to \u201cimprove\u201d the H-2A andH-2Bprograms, although it\u2019s unclear what exactly that means. If his first term is any indication, it means \u201cimprove\u201d for the employers. During Trump 1.0 the temporary work visa programssteadily grewa total of 13 percent larger, and he used the Covid emergency tohelp make it happen: During the pandemic, his administration issued a series of emergency measures that made H-2A and H-2B visasmoreflexibleand employer-friendly. Workers were allowed to stay in the country for longer periods of time, in part because they had been deemed \u201cessential workers,\u201d and wages for H-2A workerswere effectively frozen. With more emergencies arriving on multiple fronts, it wouldn\u2019t be surprising to see a replay. Should the Trump administration succeed in replacing temporary protected status, humanitarian parole, and others with guest workers, it would make it that much harder to organize. As Noah Zatz, a law professor at UCLAnotes: \u2026work under threat of incarceration outside of criminal punishment, or racialized state violence outside incarceration\u2014also highlight continuity withimmigration detentionand deportation. This continuity is particularly important because labor advocates and the labor movement have come to understand\u2014through a long and still-contested process\u2014howemployers gain powerto intimidate, retaliate against, and divide workers when the state\u2019s deportation threat hangs over them and can be invoked by employers. Labor Needs Due Process and Free Speech The AFL-CIO also notes how the disregard for due process and crackdowns on speech hurt immigrant workers now and will do doubt be turned on all workers down the line: In another alarming development, immigrant workers, including green card holders and work visa holders, have faced arrest, detention, revocation of status and deportation with a complete lack of due process. These attacks are affecting more and more of our union siblings, including: SMART Brother Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was deported to a Salvadoran mega-prison in what the Department of Justice has admitted was a mistake. The administration is refusing to comply with a unanimous Supreme Court order to facilitate his return. Former UAW Brother Mahmoud Khalil, a green card holder with a pregnant U.S. citizen wife, who is being detained without charge and told his green card will be revoked for criticizing U.S. foreign policy. SEIU Sister R\u00fcmeysa \u00d6zt\u00fcrk, a grad student worker, was being detained, and was just recently released, for the offense of writing an op-ed in the Tufts University Law School Journal. Hundreds of other higher education student workers around the country from a wide range of unions have had their visas revoked for reasons ranging from the exercise of free speech to being from countries now being considered for new travel bans. The quickly escalating efforts to deny due process, define what constitutes acceptable speech, and arbitrarily strip workers of their visas and work permits creates a climate of fear and sets a dangerous precedent for the rights of all working people, whether they are citizens or not. Despite all the masked ICE agents ripping people out of Home Depots and actions and\u201cICE Barbie\u201dparachuting in for photo ops, the administration hasyet togo after employers of illegals, which is the easiest and most effective way to stop their hiring\u2014but that\u2019s not the goal here. Here\u2019s the AFL-CIO with a fine example: As an indication of what this imbalance in spending and priorities looks like in practice, ICE reported that it conducted a recent raid at a Philadelphia car wash because it had reports that workers were being exploited. The consequence, however, fell to the seven immigrant workers who were arrested, rather than the employer who was violating their rights. In a country where we rely on workers to report violations to enforce our labor laws, inappropriate enforcement responses such as this risk chilling the exercise of workplace rights, making all workplaces less safe and undermining our organizing efforts. Moreover, these misplaced worksite enforcement priorities incentivize predatory employer behavior that will fuel a race to the bottom in wages and working conditions in major industries around the country. At the same time, the Trump administration is gutting the Department of Labor that wasalreadywoefully understaffed (750 investigators overseeing fair labor standards at 11 million workplaces) and unserious about penalties anyways (maximum penalty per child laborer is $15,000). It has been a bipartisan effort to continually torch it with Trump now acting as an accelerant. As the administration continues to dismantle the federal agencies charged with enforcing our labor and employment laws, the investment in immigration enforcement continues to increase. Our nation already spends 14 times more on immigration enforcement than it does to enforce all the laws to protect more than 165 million workers in job sites around the country. Gutting our government\u2019s resources and capacity to enforce labor standards and protections while stripping immigrant workers of rights and ramping up immigration enforcement is a core part of the anti-union, anti-worker playbook that will enable employers to violate worker rights with impunity. This is a toxic formula that will drive down standards for all workers in key industries and increase wage theft, child labor violations, and preventable workplace injuries and fatalities. Indeed, that appears to be the plan. With Trump and DOGE\u2019sguttingof the National Labor Relations Board, attacks on federal workers unions, selective deportations, Gold Cards, and promotion of H-2 workers, the goal is to make all workers more like the undocumented ones. Here\u2019sMichael Macher: \u2026the US immigration system runs not on the enforcement of immigration laws, but on their selective nonenforcement. Employers have relied on the state to ignore the exploitation of undocumented labor while holding the credible threat of deportation over workers. This has had the effect of strengthening employer bargaining power generally against all workers\u2014lowering wages, weakening unions, and shifting the politics of work away from collective bargaining and wage-and-hour regulation. The interest in labor that is weak and disorganized has driven US politicians, consciously or not, to adopt the role of petty bosses, threatening the deportation of significant portions of the US workforce. But if Trump can afford to blow up this arrangement, it is because the precarity of the undocumented worker represents the future of labor relations in the US, not its past. **Post navigation** **Subscribe to Post Comments30 comments** tJune 11, 2025 at 7:00 amExcellent summary.Reply\u2193chukjonesJune 11, 2025 at 8:58 amYes, thx Conner.

As in, a civilian protester can hold signs saying \u201cNo one is illegal\u201d or \u201cAbolish ICE Now\u201d or even wave the Mexican flag on seized highways, but officials who command police forces or are charged with immigration enforcement probably shouldn\u2019t cheer \u2014 unless they harbor utopian notions about a borderless world, which they inevitably do because they went to college in America.

The gullible plebs do as they are instructed by the MassMediaMonopoly Techno-Feudal overlords. And even very informed, intelligent people fall for the emotional manipulation and distractions and get lost in the forest for the trees.We have had successive US regimes and virtually every single member of the House and Senate voting to violate their own laws to send Israel billions upon billions of OUR public resources, weapons etc. to mass murder children. And both the phony liberals and pony conservative crowd say this is \u201cpatriotic\u201d? WTF?

You\u2019ll notice that in his critical line cited by AG he\u2019s arguing for the first impression a viewer might have if they see rioting. Good journalism amounts to encouraging the amendment of first impressions, not caving to them.

Taibbi has referred to Bhattacharya as a physician and/or scientist. Nope. He is a glibertarian economist who went straight from his Stanford MD graduation to the Stanford economics department for that second doctoral postnomial abbreviation. Taibbi cannot or will not understand the GBD for what it is: A not-so-soft eugenicist manifesto with no scientific foundation and the product of one our most effective Merchants of Doubt. To wit, there can be no herd immunity to a virus for which durable immunity, through previous infection or vaccination, is a unicorn. This fact of vertebrate virology, vaccinology, and epidemiology has been known for about 80 years. But I repeat myself. Again. Oh, and that Jay Bhattacharya MD-PhD is now Director of the National Institutes of Health is, well, ridiculous.Reply\u2193JonnyJamesJune 11, 2025 at 1:50 pmTaibbi is scrambling to maintain his eyeball count by pandering to the right.That sums it up. Wittingly or not, he has become part of superficial distract and divide \u201cjournalism\u201d.

And what is the point of critcising MSM for not calling the protest violent and trying to point at the larger context?\u201c(\u2026)\u201cFIERY BUT MOSTLY PEACEFUL PROTESTS AFTER POLICE SHOOTING.\u201d CNN posterized Jimenez twice, as he was also onscreen with Wolf Blitzer when the word \u201cviolent\u201d disappeared from a tagline mid-broadcast. Most mainstream observers defended the oxymoronic approach, hailing a September 2020 study that mathematically characterized the mostly-peacefulness of that summer\u2019s protests (93%!) while arguing the public should be focused on greater violence-s of racism, colonialism, police brutality, etc.(\u2026)\u201d I doubt he would disagree with Conor\u00b4s piece. But then why hit on \u201crevolting homages to Marx and socialist revolution\u201d?Taibbi must be aware of how workers\u00b4 rights were achieved in the US. The space for serious media criticism without siding with the protest in contrast to do biased political commentary is at times so narrow, it\u00b4s almost invisible and his point might lack merit. A bit only as if doing it for the sake of it. What would he be doing if people got shot? Would he still try to find the \u201cwrinkle\u201d, because it was Chinese-produced bullets, not American? Which is why diverting to real entertainment via book review appears to be right reaction to preserve artistic independence from the turmoil.(a little Andy Kaufman?) p.s.

I wonder if Trump\u2019s last name were Bush if we would see even more acquiescence. From Taibbi\u2019s longer article. (He\u2019s not wrong, imo.): This is the moment when the previously disinterested voter looks up, notices governors and mayors and congresspersons expressing apparently limitless support for illegal immigration, tax evasion, even crime, and wonders what the deal is. As in, a civilian protester can hold signs saying \u201cNo one is illegal\u201d or \u201cAbolish ICE Now\u201d or even wave the Mexican flag on seized highways, but officials who command police forces or are charged with immigration enforcement probably shouldn\u2019t cheer \u2014 unless they harbor utopian notions about a borderless world, which they inevitably do because they went to college in America. This zone of realization is where Trump cleans up every time. I used to think it was unfortunate, now I think it\u2019s deserved. These idiots can\u2019t muster the energy to even pretend to care at even a baseline level about mundane patriotic concerns like not letting absolutely everyone over the border, or drawing some kind of line when it comes to vandalism or school standards. Even the most liberal voter reaches a moment of exhaustion with this bullshit. \u2014 Me now: if Dems made this effort when C and W and O and B were in office and ICE was doing the same stuff, that would be one thing. But no, it\u2019s only when T is in office.

It was during the worst of the pandemic. He worried that fascism was setting in because people on the left had sheltered in place, done what they were told, retreated into Zoom and abandoned the public square.\u201cIt\u2019s one of the Ten Commandments of the left,\u201d he told The Dig podcast in 2020. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s the First Commandment. You never relinquish the streets.\u201dHe was right: Nonviolent public protests are our sword and shield. We need to use them. Davis, who wrote about L.A.\u2019s history from the bottom up, saw its future as well as anyone. The cover of his 1990 book, City of Quartz, shows the Metropolitan Detention Center, ground zero for today\u2019s protests.If you\u2019re still looking for a sign, here\u2019s another one: June 15 is the 10th anniversary of when the fascist descent began. We\u2019ve been living with the MAGA nightmare for exactly a decade.On that day in 2015, Trump rode down his golden escalator to announce his bid for President. We all know what he said about crime, drugs, and \u201crapists\u201d from Mexico. But he prefaced his dehumanizing language more broadly: \u201cThe U.S.,\u201d he said, \u201chas become a dumping ground for everybody else\u2019s problems.\u201dHe was being perfectly clear, but many didn\u2019t take it seriously. Soon after in The New York Times, Ross Douthat wrote, \u201cThere\u2019s something that\u2019s joyfully ridiculous about his candidacy.\u201d In August, Maureen Dowd welcomed Trump into the race: \u201cSometimes you need a showman in the show.\u201dAnother Times writer, though, came to a different conclusion after Trump repeated his \u201cdumping ground\u201d line at a rally that month in Dallas:The problem with this particular clown is that his words are not clownish. The language he uses about immigrants is dehumanizing and vile. The audiences that adore him are animated not just by infatuation, but by the age-old catalysts of fear, resentment and hate. This is what moves the Trump effect into the realm of the frightening, rather than amusing or fascinating.That was years before \u201cshithole countries.\u201d Before the mass kidnapping of migrant children and the massacre of Latinos at Walmart in El Paso. Before the lies about immigrants eating cats and dogs, the killing of Temporary Protected Status, the massive use of feds and cops in renewed workplace raids. Before the regime started sending busloads and planeloads of migrants into gulags foreign and domestic, and the Supreme Court gave its blessing to wild abuses of power.Before Justice Sonia Sotomayor had to write, in dissent: \u201cHistory is no stranger to such lawless regimes, but this Nation\u2019s system of laws is designed to prevent, not enable, their rise.\u201d(\u2026)Mike Davis is gone. But you and I aren\u2019t. All of us are lucky to still be alive in these times. We\u2019ve been given the opportunity to live out our ideals, to fight for our values, to be the community and the people we always said we were.(\u2026)\u201dReply\u2193David in Friday HarborJune 11, 2025 at 11:56 amTerrific comment on a terrific post by Connor.

You never relinquish the streets.\u201d He was right: Nonviolent public protests are our sword and shield. We need to use them. Davis, who wrote about L.A.\u2019s history from the bottom up, saw its future as well as anyone. The cover of his 1990 book, City of Quartz, shows the Metropolitan Detention Center, ground zero for today\u2019s protests.

Soon after in The New York Times, Ross Douthat wrote, \u201cThere\u2019s something that\u2019s joyfully ridiculous about his candidacy.\u201d In August, Maureen Dowd welcomed Trump into the race: \u201cSometimes you need a showman in the show.\u201d Another Times writer, though, came to a different conclusion after Trump repeated his \u201cdumping ground\u201d line at a rally that month in Dallas: The problem with this particular clown is that his words are not clownish. The language he uses about immigrants is dehumanizing and vile. The audiences that adore him are animated not just by infatuation, but by the age-old catalysts of fear, resentment and hate.
