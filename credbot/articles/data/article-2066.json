Several organizations came together at the meeting on Monday to call on city officials to reject xAI\u2019s permit applications to run methane gas turbines. They criticized the mayor, and are calling for an effort to stop Elon Musk\u2019s xAI project from proceeding. Following remarks regarding him and his support for the xAI expansion, Young summoned the meeting with Representatives Joe Towns, G.A. Hardaway, Torrey Harris, and Justin J. Pearson. The meeting\u2019s goal, according to Mayor Young, was to update the state officials on the project\u2019s progress and address any \u201cmisunderstandings\u201d over the city\u2019s involvement with xAI. \u201cWhile I\u2019m thankful that the Mayor brought folks together today, the reality of what we are dealing with is that we should have been included in the conversation before this project ever came here. Because you know who would have asked questions about public health? I would have.\u201d MUST-WATCH: \u201cWe went to MEMPHIS and found an environmental crime scene.\u201dAn important@MorePerfectUSdeep dive on Elon\u2019s XAI supercomputer polluting Memphis with no community input, no permits, and seemingly no guardrails.#MemphisVsMuskFull:https://t.co/BAgieCuY07pic.twitter.com/rM0TbG3zMe Privacy Policy Terms of Service General Contest Rules FCC Online Public File EEO Report Station Information Employment Opportunities Cumulus Media Corporate Copyright 2020 Cumulus Media / Cumulus Media is an equal opportunity employer / AA View Full Site"}
