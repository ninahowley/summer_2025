Amid reports of escalating violence and unrest, L.A. Mayor Karen Bass issued a stark warning. \u201cEveryone has the right to peacefully protest, but let me be clear: Violence and destruction are unacceptable, and those responsible will be held accountable,\u201dBass saidon Saturday evening, emphasizing that L.A. personnel had \u201cbeen in direct contact with officials in Washington, D.C.,\u201d in an effort to \u201cfind the best path forward.\u201d Advertisement Advertisement However, there has been conflict as to what the best course of action should be. In a move that prompted division,Trump ordered the California National Guardto quell the immigration protests, moving to deploy 2,000 soldiers to the Los Angeles area. \u201cThese radical left protests, by instigators and often paid troublemakers, will not be tolerated. Also, from now on, masks will not be allowed to be worn at protests. What do these people have to hide, and why?\u201d Trump said viaTruth Social. On Sunday morning, around 8 a.m. local time, troops from California\u2019s National Guard began to arrive in L.A. The U.S. Northern Command, a combatant command of the U.S. Department of Defense,confirmed that\"elements of the 79th Infantry Brigade Combat Team from the California National Guard have begun deploying to the Los Angeles area, with some already on the ground.\" Asecond update statedthat \u201c79th IBCT has deployed approximately 300 soldiers to three separate locations in the greater Los Angeles area. They are conducting safety and protection of federal property and personnel.\u201d CaliforniaGov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat who has a long history of tension with the President, labelled Trump\u2019s move to involve the National Guard as\u201cpurposefully inflammatory\u201d and something that will only \"escalate tensions.\" \u201cThe federal government is taking over the California National Guard and deploying 2,000 soldiers in Los Angeles\u2014not because there is a shortage of law enforcement, but because they want a spectacle,\u201d Newsom saidon Saturday, urging Californians to \u201cnot give them one [a spectacle]\u201d and to \u201cspeak out peacefully\u201d rather than resorting to violence. Following the arrival of the National Guard in L.A. on Sunday morning, Newsomposted a video on social mediaof the troops. Doubling down on his disapproval, he said: \u201cTrump is sending 2,000 National Guard troops into L.A. County\u2014not to meet an unmet need, but to manufacture a crisis. He\u2019s hoping for chaos so he can justify more crackdowns, more fear, more control.\u201d Newsom again urged Californians to \u201cnever use violence\u201d and \u201cstay peaceful.\u201d Newsom had previously accusedthe federal government of \"sowing chaos so they can have an excuse to escalate,\" countering that this \"is not the way any civilized country behaves.\" Read More:Trump Set to Ratchet Up His Immigration Crackdown During Next 100 Days Earlier on Sunday morning, Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont strongly criticized Trump\u2019s move. \"We have a President who is moving this country rapidly into authoritarianism,\u201d Sanders said duringan appearance on CNN\u2019sState of the Union.\u201cMy understanding is\u2014the Governor of California, the Mayor of the city of Los Angeles, did not request the National Guard, but he thinks he has a right to do anything he wants. I would say, that to a large degree, the future of this country rests with a small number of Republicans in the House and Senate who know better.\u201d However, Republican Sen. Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma defended Trump\u2019s decision to bypass the California Governor and deploy the National Guard to the Los Angeles area. \"I don't know why a Governor would want to try to protect illegal activity inside a state. And the President has made it very clear, if the Governor or the Mayor of a city isn't willing to protect the citizens of his state or the city, then the President will,\u201dMullin saidonState of the Union. Elsewhere, the ACLUcondemned Trump\u2019s decision, calling it \u201cakin to a declaration of war on all Californians.\u201d \u201cThere is no rational reason to deploy the National Guard on Angelenos, who are rightfully outraged by the federal government\u2019s attack on our communities and justly exercising their First Amendment right to protest the violent separation of our families,\u201d the ACLU\u2019s statement said. \u201cWe intend to file suit and hold this administration accountable and to protect our communities from further attacks.\u201d Meanwhile, in an emailed statement to TIME, Lisa Sherman Luna, executive director of the Tennessee Immigrant and Refugee Rights Coalition, warned that the scenes in L.A. should concern every American. \"After ICE escalated their already rogue operations in Los Angeles, they are using the chaos and crisis that they themselves created to justify calling up the National Guard,\" said Luna. \"This Administration\u2019s continued attempts to control and punish its political opponents, combined with its willingness to ignore court orders that it doesn\u2019t agree with, and steamroll people's right to due process, should concern each and every American. Today it\u2019s Los Angeles, but tomorrow it will be at your doorstep.\" Further showcasing the Trump Administration's stance, Defense Secretary Pete Hegsethposted a warning on Xlate on Saturday night, stating the Pentagon was ready to mobilize active-duty Marines at Camp Pendleton\u2014a main West Coast base of the Marines. \u201cThey are on high alert,\u201d Hegseth remarked. In response,Newsom said: \u201cThe Secretary of Defense is now threatening to deploy active-duty Marines on American soil against its own citizens. This is deranged behavior.\u201d **When was the last time a President activated a state\u2019s National Guard force without a request from the state's governor?** According to experts, Trump is the first President to deploy the National Guard without a request from the state Governor since 1965, when President Lyndon B. Johnson sent federal troops to Alabama to protect those partaking in a civil rights march from Selma to Montgomery, led by Martin Luther King Jr. Trump\u2019s directive, though,was for the deployed troops to \u201cperform those military protective activities that the Secretary of Defense determines are reasonably necessary to ensure the protection and safety of Federal personnel and property.\u201d The National Guard has been deployed in Los Angeles before\u2014including during the George Floyd protests of 2020at the request of Newsom and duringthe five-day 1992 rebellionsparked by the beating of Rodney King. In 1992, more than 10,000 National Guardsmen and 2,000 federal troops were deployed to quell the protests. But the key difference between that instance and what is currently taking place, is that in 1992 the then-Governor of California Pete Wilson and L.A. Mayor Tom Bradley had requested these troops be federalized by then-President George H.W. Bush. **What are the L.A. protests about?** The protests began on Friday after ICE agents conducted another round of operations in and around the city. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS)said in a statement on Saturdaythat ICE operations in L.A. this week have resulted in the arrest of 118 people. Overall, the DHS said: \u201cICE has arrested 2,000 aliens a day this week and these violent activists won\u2019t deter enforcement operations.\u201d All 15 city council members releaseda joint statementcondemning the raids and their impact on the community. \u201cWe condemn this in no uncertain terms: Los Angeles was built by immigrants and it thrives because of immigrants. We will not abide by fear tactics to support extreme political agendas that aim to stoke fear and spread discord in our city,\u201d the statement read. \u201cTo every immigrant living in our city: we see you, we stand with you, and we will fight for you. Los Angeles will continue to be a place that values and dignifies every human being, no matter who they are or where they come from.\u201d Speaking out further,Mayor Bass said: \"These tactics sow terror in our communities and disrupt basic principles of safety in our city\u2026 we will not stand for this.\" Read More:Legal Immigration Pathways Are Disappearing The Coalition for Humane Immigrants Rightshosted a press conferenceon Friday, organized by leaders of the L.A. Rapid Response Network. \u201cTo our immigrant community: We see you, we hear you, and we will not stop fighting for you,\u201d the organization said in an online post. \u201cWe say no deportations. No to mass detentions. Families belong together. We belong here.\u201d Protests in downtown Los Angeles and in the city of Paramount in Los Angeles County have garnered national attention as some protesters clashed with law enforcement\u2014leading to multiple arrests. Speaking to theNew YorkTimes,Bilal A. 'Bill' Essayli, the interim U.S. Attorney for the Central District of California, said that over 100 people were arrested by federal law enforcement at protests on Friday, with at least 20 more arrests made during Saturday\u2019s demonstrations. Some initial demonstrations appear to have been organized by immigrant rights groups, while others were impromptu protests that began at the site of some of the raid operations. Further protests are planned for Sunday. Daniel Kanstroom, a professor at Boston College Law School, says that this is an \u201cincredibly dangerous\u201d moment in America\u2014and that L.A. represents just one juncture in the \u201ctectonic problem\u201d of immigration that has been festering for decades. Trump\u2019s tactics, he says, have only worsened this crisis. \u201cWhen you have agents apparently arbitrarily arresting people, pulling them off the street without showing a warrant, without explaining who they are, without being respectful, then this creates a sense of terror and fear in the community, and that tends to result, sooner or later, in a kind of resistance, which is what we're seeing develop,\u201d says Kanstroom. The \u201cunusual if not unprecedented\u201d use of \u201cemergency\u201d is once again at play here by Trump, he adds. \u201cHe's calling everything as an emergency. So it's not at all surprising he would seek to take advantage of an emergency like this in order to crack down in even harsher ways.\u201d **Must-Reads from TIME** L.A.
