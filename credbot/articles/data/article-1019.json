As Rebecca Jacobs, a research associate at CREW, wrote, \u201cThe most corrupt president of all time is back in office with a slew of new conflicts of interest.\u201d Corruption, of course, is not new to US politics. From Watergate to the Iran-Contra affair, American history is riddled with examples of public officials exploiting their positions. As Kristen Drybread, coeditor ofCorruption and Illiberal Politics in the Trump Era, explained toNPQ, the history ofaccumulation of wealthby career politicians\u2014many of whom have become millionaires while in office\u2014suggests that such abuses long predate Trump. But what is new is the brazenness. Rather than being concealed, corruption under Trump isovert,performative, and, in many cases,legally sanctionedby far-right courts. Unsurprisingly, this is all part of a larger strategy, alongside Trump\u2019sauthoritarian spectacle, to reshape the legal and political landscape. The more gifts (like the$400 million planeQatar donated to act as Air Force One) or lavish expenses (such as Trump\u2019s$148 million meme coin dinner), the more democratic norms erode and allow Trump andother oligarchsto profit from their public positions. This leaves grassroots organizations and nonprofits as a critical bastion of resistance for civil society\u2014and offers the opportunity to develop new strategies and systems of care that center the many rather than the few. **What Is \u201cCorruption\u201d Exactly?** While the term \u201ccorruption\u201d is often invoked to describe the erosion of democratic norms, its legal definition remainsstrikingly narrow. \u201cCorruption does not necessarily align with what is illegal,\u201d Danielle Brian, the executive director and president of the nonprofit Project On Government Oversight (POGO) toldNPQ. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not corruption. It just means our systems are not meeting the moment.\u201d \u201cThere are many things that we have in our culture before Trump was reelected that were corrupt but legal,\u201d she noted, pointing tocampaign finance loopholes, lawmakers\u2019 ability totrade stocks, and the exemption of the president and vice president fromcertain ethics rulesas examples of practices that may be lawful but are deeply unethical. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not corruption. It just means our systems are not meeting the moment,\u201d she explained. \u201cCorruption is the abuse of political power for private gain. It doesn\u2019t necessarily mean financial gain. Sometimes what we\u2019re seeing happen is someone using their political power to just advance their power.\u201d **Trump\u2019s Overt Corruption** Historically, officials sought to obscure corrupt acts to avoid public outrage or legal consequences. Trump, by contrast,seems to embracethe inadequacy of the law as part of his political brand. Since taking office, Trump\u2019s actions\u2014particularly those made for his own personal gain\u2014are thinly veiled, at best. If corruption in his first term was a whisper, this time it\u2019s a bombastic shout. \u201cTrump\u2019s been able to get away with visible corruption because he doesn\u2019t try to hide it\u2026.Instead, he recasts his self-dealing, dishonesty, and abuse as proof that he\u2019s powerful, successful, and not a chump,\u201d Drybread said. This performance of power is not incidental butstrategic. Visible corruption functions as a transitional mechanism\u2014eroding democratic norms, normalizing impunity, and paving the way forauthoritarian control. \u201cIn an era where politics has become increasingly mediatized, Trump\u2019s spectacles\u2026constitute a performative governance style rooted in authoritarian populism,\u201d Peter Bloom, professor of Management at the University of Essex, toldNPQ. For the nonprofit sector, this shiftposes an existential threatsince many organizations rely on the rule of law, transparency, and public accountability to carry out their missions. But now, these democratic foundations arebeing actively dismantled. Indeed, the Trump administration has increasingly used corrupt\u2014and likely unlawful\u2014means to undermine nonprofits:slashing federal funding, attempting toconsolidate controlover independent organizations, andthreatening the tax-exempt statusof groups that challenge its policies. As Chioma Chukwu, interim executive director of nonpartisan watchdog organization American Oversight, explained toNPQ, \u201cWhen rule-breaking becomes commonplace and consequences disappear, the public\u2019s sense of outrage dulls. This desensitization makes it easier for antidemocratic behavior to take root and spread, normalizing abuses that would have once triggered alarm.\u201d **When Corruption Becomes Law** Legal redefinitions of corruption have not only failed to constrain Trump\u2019s executive overreach\u2014they\u2019ve helped legitimize it. InMcDonnell v. United States(2016), the US Supreme Court significantly narrowed the federal definition of corruption, limiting it toexplicit quid pro quoarrangements involving specific \u201cofficial acts.\u201d As a result,gifts, privileged access, and blatant favoritism often escape legal scrutiny. \u201cWhen rule-breaking becomes commonplace and consequences disappear, the public\u2019s sense of outrage dulls.\u201d And the narrowing of corruption laws has emboldened political actors to blur ethical lines under the guise of legality, enabling Trump to defy ethical norms openly. As Chukwu noted, \u201cCorruption\u2014especially when committed openly\u2014operates as a show of dominance. It signals to the public that those in power are above the law, while simultaneously discouraging dissent by undermining faith in accountability. Authoritarian regimes often use this visibility strategically: not to hide misconduct but to flaunt it.\u201d While this flaunting of misconduct was evident from the start of his first administration, as Brian noted, taking office and \u201cpublicly exploiting our weak corruption laws as they apply to the presidency\u201d in Trump\u2019s second term has only intensified. **What Nonprofits Must Do Now** As visible corruption becomes agoverning strategy, nonprofits must adapt. The illusion that \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d still applieshas evaporatedin today\u2019s political environment, one in which accountability isdeliberately undermined, oversight is hollowed out, andspectacle replaces substance. The nonprofit sector must not only defend democratic norms buttake up the mantleof actively rebuilding them. As Chukwu said, \u201cThis is a moment that demands vigilance, strategic litigation, and storytelling.\u201d Drawing on interviews with watchdog leaders, scholars, and accountability experts, here are six key strategies nonprofit leaders must consider in responding to this authoritarian moment: Document Relentlessly\u2014Even Without Immediate Recourse. A clear, factual record is the foundation of future accountability. Even when courts falter or watchdog agencies are defunded,documentation preserves the truthand lays the groundwork for legal, journalistic, or public reckoning.

Reframe Corruption as a Democratic Emergency. As we well know, corruption today isovert, performative, and systemic. Yet it\u2019s too often framed as a technical or ethical issue rather than a democratic crisis. \u201cEffective campaigns must translate systemic misconduct into clear, moral terms that mobilize people, linking abuses of power to harms that communities understand, like public health, economic justice, and civil rights,\u201d Chukwu toldNPQ. Nonprofits can help reframe corruption by connecting institutional erosion to tangible harms such asunsafe housing,polluted water,voter suppression, anddefunded schools. \u201cWatchdog groups must track and expose efforts to suppress dissent, subvert oversight, and politicize the justice system\u2026.Simultaneously, we must amplify the stories of those who have been harmed, connecting legal analysis to their lived experiences,\u201d Chukwu explained. \u201cDemocracy doesn\u2019t erode in the abstract; it erodes in courtrooms, cabinet meetings, and executive memos. Our job is to bring that into the light and keep government officials from shrouding their work in secrecy or illegally covering their tracks.\u201d By grounding abstract principles in everyday consequences, nonprofits can mobilize public concern and reengage communities. \u201cDemocracy doesn\u2019t erode in the abstract; it erodes in courtrooms, cabinet meetings, and executive memos.\u201d Build Narrative Power to Counter Spectacle. Trump\u2019s dominance stems not just from policy but fromnarrative control. Spectacle is part of the strategy\u2014and the nonprofit sector mustreclaim the power of storytelling. \u201cNarratives that humanize the consequences of corruption and show how legal manipulation affects everyday life can reenergize civic engagement and resistance,\u201d Chukwu said. \u201cWe need to tell better stories,\u201d added Drybread and pointed to The OpEd Project, a nonprofit that works to amplify the voices of those often excluded from public discourse, including nonprofit leaders and underrepresented thinkers. Rooted in the belief that \u201cthe story we tell becomes the world we live in,\u201d the organization trains individuals to step into thought leadership roles and helps shift who gets heard in public conversations. \u201cI think nonprofits need to make themselves publicly visible as the heroic figures they often are. The public is so often unaware of the amazing and important work nonprofits do because such work rarely brings fame or riches,\u201d Drybread continued. \u201cThey can write op-eds, publicize their work on Tik Tok, find ways to reach people and tell their stories.\u201d Build Cross-Sector Solidarity and Collective Infrastructure. In this political climate, no organization can stand alone. Leadersemphasizethe growing need for collective legal support, cybersecurity, communications strategies, and rapid response infrastructure. \u201cOne thing I think is really great is that our community is proactively coming together. There are a variety of spaces where those of us leading organizations are connecting across the sector, recognizing that when one member of our community is being threatened\u2014[when] our First Amendment rights to do this work [are at risk]\u2014it impacts all of us,\u201d Brian toldNPQ. Brian notes that early fragmentation amonguniversitiesandlaw firmsleft the sector vulnerable. But as collaboration increased, so did their resilience. What has been especially helpful is sharing resources, legal strategies, and advice on how to set ourselves up for success. Prepare for 24-Hour Communications Cycles. In amedia landscapedriven by speed and spectacle, real-time response is essential. Nonprofits must train staff in crisis communications, form rapid response teams, and build relationships with journalists before the next headline breaks. \u201cWe\u2019re also very focused on the rumors of executive orders targeting our sector\u2014and it\u2019s very realistic given the executive orders that we\u2019ve already seen. We\u2019re very much on a rapid response,\u201d Brian explained. \u201cWe\u2019ve actually brought on a PR firm to help us with rapid response communications because we think it\u2019s really important to get ahead of the narrative and what is happening every day.\u201d She added, \u201cThe velocity of the news cycle is breathtaking, and it\u2019s more than any single organization that works on corruption can handle with the staff that we have. I think that that\u2019s an important thing to recognize: In the end, especially when we look at how other countries have survived authoritarian threats, it is the voice of civil society.\u201d Advance a Vision Beyond Resistance. Finally, experts note that corruption today is not only about personal gain\u2014it reflects the emergence of what Bloom calls the \u201cauthoritarian-financial complex\u201d: a fusion of state power and private capital that thrives on crisis, insecurity, and privatization. \u201cThe logic of this system is recursive: It produces crises that it then claims to solve through mechanisms of surveillance, austerity, and top-down intervention,\u201d Bloom toldNPQ. \u201cPolitical imagination is trapped within the closed loop of technocratic solutions and strongman fantasies,\u201d he continued, \u201cwhere progress is synonymous with executive decisiveness, where public safety is conflated with control, and where prosperity is imaginable only through market compliance.\u201d Nonprofits must counter this not only by resisting repression but by modeling different systems of care, ownership, and governance, he explained. That includes (but is not limited to): Commons-based resource stewardshipParticipatory budgetingandlocal democracyCollective ownership ofhousing,food, andenergyMutual aid,cooperative economies, andnarrative repairDefinitions of wealth based oninterdependence,not accumulation Commons-based resource stewardship Participatory budgetingandlocal democracy Collective ownership ofhousing,food, andenergy Mutual aid,cooperative economies, andnarrative repair Definitions of wealth based oninterdependence,not accumulation Commons-based resource stewardship Participatory budgetingandlocal democracy Collective ownership ofhousing,food, andenergy Mutual aid,cooperative economies, andnarrative repair Definitions of wealth based oninterdependence,not accumulation \u201cThe real danger here is not just repression\u2014it is the foreclosure of alternatives,\u201d Bloom toldNPQ. The nonprofit sector must becomemore than a service provider; it must become asite of democratic imagination\u2014an engine fornew forms of public lifeandcollective power. \u201cIf there is one question that should be asked more urgently,\u201d Bloom posited, \u201cit is this: What would it look like to build a world where freedom does not require force, where prosperity does not require profit, and where leadership does not require submission?\u201d Zane McNeill is the editor ofVegan Entanglements: Dismantling Racial and Carceral Capitalism(Lantern Publishing & Media, 2022) andBuilding Multispecies Resistance Against Exploitation: Stories from the Frontlines of Labor and Animal Rights(Peter Lang Publishing, 2024).
