Credit: Jacob Biba/100 Days Jessie Greenblatt calls her hometown of Hendersonville, in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Western North Carolina, \u201ca very quaint little town.\u201d But, oh, how she\u2019s seen it suffer. A woman Greenblatt went to high school with hosts a Facebook page that serves as a memorial to people roughly in the same age group who have died. Greenblatt, who\u2019s 33 and has asked to be identified by her fianc\u00e9\u2019s last name, says, \u201cI can scroll through it, and I\u2019ll be, \u2018They overdosed. They overdosed\u2026\u2019\u201d She recognizes how close she\u2019s come to being numbered in that litany. By the time Greenblatt reached high school, oxycontin had laid siege to Hendersonville. She was introduced to it by an older boyfriend. After several years of use, she found her way to a rehab facility in Memphis, then into a sober living home there. She struggled to stay drug free. But with no long-term plan for recovery, no secure place in which to gain focus, she returned to use. State and federal governments had begun cracking down on the prescribing of opioids, and she was introduced to heroin. She bounced around a little before returning to Hendersonville. Fentanyl was now ubiquitous. It was a grim time in Greenblatt\u2019s life. She experienced several relapses. Her grandfather agreed to pay for a detox facility in Philadelphia. She completed it, then immediately went on the medicationbuprenorphine. She\u2019s remained in recovery since. But things got scary when Greenblatt learned she was pregnant: She was given what she came to learn was some potentially harmful, misguided information. The Hendersonville clinic at which she was receiving her buprenorphine told her she needed to taper off it completely \u2014 that if there was any in her system at the time of delivery, her baby would be taken from her. She already felt she\u2019d been judged unfit for motherhood; now she was frightened, despondent. Fortunately, fatefully, Greenblatt was then connected withProject CARA\u2014 Care that Advocates Respect/Resilience/Recovery for All \u2014 an Asheville, North Carolina-based program that supports pregnant and parenting people with substance use disorders. Within theMountain Area Health Education Center\u2019s obstetrics and gynecology department, Project CARA offers medical, substance use and behavioral health care and other support services in one place. Greenblatt was introduced to Sarah Peiffer, a family medicine specialist withBlue Ridge Health, a Project CARA spoke in Hendersonville. Peiffer quickly set the record straight on buprenorphine \u2014 she did not need to taper off her medication \u2014 and helped Greenblatt find her footing on the path to a healthy delivery. Survey data indicates that Project CARA patients attend more prenatal and postpartum appointments than those outside the program; they\u2019re more likely to receive substance use treatment during their pregnancy; and they\u2019re more satisfied with their care. \u201cWe know that if patients come to us and keep coming to us, what we do here is working,\u201d says Amy Marietta, Project CARA\u2019s medical director. \u201cIt\u2019s helping them achieve their goals.\u201d Jessie Greenblatt wants to tell her story. Her son was born August 23, 2021. His birth went smoothly \u2014 he received a single dose of methadone, which studies have shown to be an effective means of addressingneonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome\u2014 and he\u2019s an active, inquisitive kid today, \u201call over the place,\u201d Greenblatt says. Medical studies show children exposed to buprenorphine in uterodo not experience any negative effects to their physical, mental or behavioral development. This was true for Greenblatt\u2019s son. Greenblatt withstood the stigma she encountered as a pregnant woman with a history of drug use; she withstood an ignorance of proper care. She found the support she needed to have a healthy pregnancy and deliver a healthy child, and she wants others to know it\u2019s available. \u201cYou want to try and do everything right for your kid,\u201d Greenblatt says, \u201cbut you\u2019ve got nobody in your corner. It\u2019s really hard. At Project CARA, I\u2019ve always felt like I had somebody there.\u201d \u201cDr. Peiffer was in my corner.\u201d **\u2018I just want the best for my baby\u2019** A game-changer for the treatment of perinatal substance use disorder, Marietta says, is the availability of buprenorphine in an outpatient setting. Transportation is a primary barrier to care in these mountains; Project CARA strives to provide as much assistance as possible in one visit. Easier access to buprenorphine is critical to recovery for so many, she stresses. The program employs a hub-and-spokes model, based onVermont\u2019s system for treating opioid use disorder. The hub is in Asheville; there are seven spokes in the state\u2019s 16 westernmost counties, most of which are largely rural, quite remote and generally underserved. OB-GYN services arefew and far-flung. Central to Project CARA\u2019s mission, Marietta says, is \u201cnourishing and developing\u201d providers in those remote counties, supporting them with whatever they need to offer these services. Patients commonly arrive for a first visit to a Project CARA office having been subjected to stigma and fed misinformation. \u201cWe so often hear from patients that they\u2019re terrified,\u201d Marietta says. \u201c\u2018I\u2019m so confused. What should I do? I just want the best for my baby.\u2019\u201d \u201cPregnancy is such a unique, motivational moment,\u201d says Caitlin Hettich, a Project CARA behavioral health clinician. It\u2019s critical to seize that moment. For patients with a history of drug use, it\u2019s also an intensely vulnerable time. Tammy Cody, director of navigation, says, \u201cKnowing that the end result may be going to the hospital and not taking that child home \u2014 this is the level of fear that we\u2019re talking about having to overcome to get in the door.\u201d \u201cWe hear over and over from our patients that the hardest part is actually walking through the door,\u201d Marietta says. \u201cSo we celebrate when people come. And many times, our patients tell us it\u2019s the first time they ever felt safe or heard or listened to in any sort of medical environment.\u201d Greenblatt acknowledges the fear she felt. She didn\u2019t learn she was pregnant until three months in. \u201cI was like, \u2018Oh my God, I\u2019ve got six months. I\u2019ve gotta get off [buprenorphine]. I was freaking out. \u2018They\u2019re gonna take my baby\u2019 \u2014 because that\u2019s what these people were telling me.\u201d Peiffer assured her that wasn\u2019t going to happen. Greenblatt was able to continue to receive treatment in a discreet setting. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the only thing they\u2019re here for,\u201d Peiffer says. \u201cThey\u2019re going to come in to visit me and I\u2019m going to check in on, \u2018How\u2019s the other mood stuff you\u2019ve been dealing with? How\u2019s your thyroid disorder been?\u2019 In addition to, \u2018Are you having any withdrawal symptoms? Are you having any problems with cravings?\u2019\u201d Bayla Ostrach is a Western North Carolina-based medical anthropologist who studies reproductive health care access, substance use disorder treatment and the ways stigma can affect access to care. \u201cWhen I first observed in their clinic, I was struck by how much time the whole clinic team spends listening to patients talk about not only their clinical needs, but also the larger context of what was happening in their lives and how it brought them to where they are now,\u201d Ostrach says. \u201cThe research on what pregnant and parenting people with substance use disorders need to successfully access evidence-based care, especially in rural Appalachian areas where there is less treatment available, is clear,\u201d Ostrach says. \u201cPatients appreciate supportive, nonjudgmental care, and providers that offer it can help patients overcome other barriers, including stigma. Project CARA does just that.\u201d The pact is that the patient is in charge. That\u2019s understood from the outset. Should you choose to walk out the door, that\u2019s your prerogative, says Anna Gerhardt, Project CARA\u2019s lead nurse, \u201cand we\u2019ll still be here if you decide to come back.\u201d **No dancing around it** Some Project CARA patients remain in active use. \u201cNo one dances around the subject,\u201d Hettich says. \u201cOur providers say, \u2018When was your last use?\u2019 They welcome honesty. They say, \u2018I\u2019m so glad you told me that. Now let\u2019s talk about the next steps.\u2019 And I think that\u2019s a unique thing.\u201d Patients arrive feeling very guarded about what they can say about their drug use, says Judi Layton, a Project CARA certified nurse midwife who recently left the program to take a position as a psychiatric nurse practitioner, because they\u2019ve so often experienced \u201ca lot of very prejudicial treatment and a lot of hostility and anger from providers.\u201d Admitting to a relapse is frightening. \u201cThey know we\u2019re not going to judge them,\u201d Layton says. The freedom to be honest builds trust, which enhances the probability they\u2019ll return for that next visit. \u201cWe have patients who come to us who have been in recovery for 10 years and we have people who use in the parking lot before they come upstairs,\u201d Gerhardt says. The next step is, \u201c\u2018Okay, what support can we offer you, wherever you\u2019re at.\u2019\u201d Naloxone is offered at every visit. \u201cWe talk a lot about theNever Use Alone hotline, which we\u2019re big fans of,\u201d Marietta says. \u201cWe provide information aboutsyringe exchange programs, harm reduction programs.\u201d The federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration affirms that harm reduction initiatives play a significant role in preventing drug-related deaths and increasing access to health care, social services and treatment. A study conducted in Seattle, for example, found that new participants in a syringe exchange program were five times more likely to enter treatment than those who weren\u2019t in the program. Marietta says that when their patients continue to use, the philosophy of harm reduction, based in respect for their rights and humanity, prevails. And there\u2019s so much that can be done for people even as they continue to use drugs. \u201cWe want to support them in achieving their goals, and if their goal is to stop using substances, we want to help them get there,\u201d she says. \u201cBut we focus so much on the process and building that rapport, which I think is arguably the most important part. \u201cWe have nine months,\u201d she adds, \u201cto really get them invested in not just taking care of the baby but themselves, and in their recovery process.\u201d **\u2018This is what we\u2019re going to do\u2019** \u201cThey treated me with respect,\u201d Greenblatt says. \u201cThey didn\u2019t judge me. They were there for me.\u201d Greenblatt calls her experience at Project CARA \u201clife-changing.\u201d Peiffer remains her primary care provider, as well as her son\u2019s, and oversees her buprenorphine treatment. Peiffer says she\u2019s encouraged by what she perceives as a mounting interest among colleagues in integrating perinatal care and substance use treatment. Forums on the subject at conferences are packed. \u201cWe\u2019ve had residents say, \u2018Hey, we\u2019ve been told these patients are too high risk for us to manage,\u2019\u201d she says. Now they\u2019re saying, \u201c\u2018Okay, this is what we\u2019re going to do.\u2019\u201d Layton says of her patients, \u201cThey want to be with their babies, and they should be, and they should be given tools to be able to do that, to be able to be successful. You hear that refrain, \u2018Well, just stop using. If you loved your baby, you would.\u2019 That\u2019s BS.\u201d Substance use disorder is a chronic, relapsing brain disease, Marietta attests. The American Society of Addiction Medicine\u2019sdefinition of the diseasestates that use continuesdespitethe harmful consequences a person experiences. Addiction is not a choice; patience is paramount. \u201cThey beat themselves up more than anyone else could ever,\u201d Layton says. \u201cThey know the things that they\u2019re going to face, and that they might be separated from their baby. And that\u2019s terrifying. It\u2019s terrifying.\u201d Jessie Greenblatt talked with her mom about the possible repercussions of publicly sharing her history with drugs. They agreed it would take a pretty low-character person to judge harshly someone who\u2019s been through so much and emerged whole. \u201cThat\u2019s a \u2018you\u2019 problem,\u201d she says, \u201cnot \u2018me.\u2019\u201d The support and respect Greenblatt\u2019s been given bolsters the foundation from which she counters the stigma. She wants the care she\u2019s received to be the norm. Again, it\u2019s life-changing. **Taylor Sisk** **Georgia's Property Tax Referendum Misses the Point** **Georgia's Property Tax Referendum Misses the Point** **Appalachia\u2019s Young Voters Could Impact the 2024 Election** **Appalachia\u2019s Young Voters Could Impact the 2024 Election** Copyright \u00a9 2024 \u2014 100 Days in Appalachia.
