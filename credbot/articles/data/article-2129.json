Become aspiked supporter. How does a judge ban one of the world\u2019s biggest social-media platforms, nakedly target political opponents and repress reporting on his involvement in the biggest corruption scandal in his country\u2019s history, and still get to be portrayed as a champion of democracy? Only, it seems, if the journalist is working for theNew Yorker. In April,the leading American magazinehailed Alexandre de Moraes as \u2018The Brazilian judge taking on the digital far right\u2019. Moraes, whose most notorious achievements to date includebanning Xand drivingpolitical opponents into exile, was presented as the only thing standing between his country and autocracy. According to journalist John Lee Anderson, Moraes is a \u2018pugnacious jurist\u2019 who has repeatedly saved his country from \u2018digital militias\u2019. The article even described the judge as \u2018conspicuously fit\u2019 and praised his \u2018sharp cheekbones\u2019. It\u2019s a good thing this terrible article was published in America, rather than Brazil, which remains in a well of authoritarianism that Moraes is in no small part responsible for. For many Brazilians, Moraes\u2019s unprecedented assault on free speech is a fresh and depressing memory. Most Brazilians received their first taste of his authoritarian streak in 2022, the year current presidentLuiz In\u00e1cio Lulada Silva defeated Jair Bolsonaro. Many Brazilians took to the streets to protest the result, centering on the capital, Brasilia. While the protests had an uncomfortable whiff of America\u2019s\u2018January 6\u2019 riotsthe previous year, ordinary voters were right to feel a little aggrieved. \u2018Lula\u2019 had servedjust over 18 monthsof a 12-year prison term after he was convicted of corruption, before his charges were overturned by a Supreme Court that now included Moraes, a longstanding political ally. The riots thatoccurred in Brasiliain January 2023 were serious, but hardly the threat to democracy and national security they were made out to be. For example, they occurred on a Sunday, meaning government buildings were largely empty. Critically, Bolsonaro wasn\u2019t even in the country \u2013 he was in Florida, where he had been since losing the election. **Enjoyingspiked?** Why not make an instant, one-off donation?

HairdresserD\u00e9bora Rodrigues dos Santos, a mother of two, was jailed for 14 years for writing, in lipstick, \u2018you lost, fool\u2019 on a statue during the demonstrations. She was only recently granted house arrest after a public outcry, and only then after a humiliating apology. Her case is one of many. Moraes is the embodiment of a phenomenon that has taken over the Brazilian Supreme Court. Most of the judges seem utterly convinced that \u2018disinformation\u2019 and \u2018hate speech\u2019 must be criminalised and that populist movements like Bolsonaro\u2019s and Trump\u2019s are not part and parcel of democracy, but something to be fought by fair means or foul. **The End of Woke** **The End of Woke** Still, few could have predicted the outright crackdown on dissent the world witnessed in August,when Moraes banned Xfor the country\u2019s more than 20million users. Predictably, he claimed his draconian actions were necessary to combat \u2018disinformation\u2019. Depressingly, it seems Moraes was just warming up. In February, he issued a nationwide ban onvideo platform Rumble, once again on the spurious pretext of defending democracy. Critics have pointed out that the Supreme Court\u2019s habit of banning platforms and accounts is a violation ofArticle 19 of theMarco Civil, Brazil\u2019s main internet law. Unsurprisingly, the Supreme Court iscurrently deliberatingwhether Article 19 is \u2018unconstitutional\u2019. For the first time since the military dictatorship, which officially ended in 1985, Brazilian political opponents are mainly overseas. There\u2019s podcaster Bruno \u2018Monark\u2019 Aiub, who would have been jailed for a year and a half for calling a communist member ofthe Supreme Court a \u2018fatty\u2019. JournalistRodrigo Constantinoand former judgeLudmila Lins Griloare others who have had their passports revoked and their bank accounts frozen. To its shame, theNew Yorkertouched on none of this. Instead, the article reads like a press release for an increasingly authoritarian figure. The magazine has betrayed Brazilian democrats. Alexandre de Moraes, who seems to possess almost limitless political power, doesn\u2019t need the help of the foreign press. The people he is silencing do. **Could Rachel Reeves crash the economy?** **Could Rachel Reeves crash the economy?** Eli Vieirais a Brazilian journalist and author.
