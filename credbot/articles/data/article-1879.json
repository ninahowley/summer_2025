The Committee is reportedly issuing a formal document request to Singham over his alleged financial support of the Party for Socialism and Liberation (PSL)\u2014an extremist Marxist group that has been helping to organize violent anti-ICE riots in Los Angeles and elsewhere. As the main funder of The People\u2019s Forum, Singham, 71, has also bankrolled the \u201cFree Palestine\u201d protests that erupted after 1,400 innocent Israelis were slaughtered by Hamas on October 7, 2023. The People\u2019s Forum works closely with other organizations inSingham\u2019s network,including PSL and the ANSWER Coalition, all of which have been involved in the anti-Israel protests and anti-ICE riots. PSLdescribes itselfas a revolutionary socialist party that believes \u201conly a revolution can end capitalism and establish socialism.\u201d The group supports the Communist Party of China (CCP) and argues that \u201cmilitant political defense of the Chinese government\u201d is necessary to stave off \u201ccounterrevolution, imperialist intervention and dismemberment.\u201d As part of their national anti-Israel mobilization efforts, ANSWER and PSL have promoted slogans such as \u201cIntifada revolution\u201d and \u201cresistance is justified.\u201d A prior member of the PSL,Elias Rodriguez, opened fire outside of the Jewish Museum in Washington DC on May 21, resulting in a Jewish couple being murdered. A witness at the scene of the attack stated the shooter chanted \u201cthere\u2019s only one solution, Intifada revolution,\u201d raising concerns about PSL\u2019s radical messaging and documented connections to Iran. The group is currently helping to organize anti-ICE demonstrations in LA, San Antonio, Oakland, Chicago and other U.S. cities. Singham, a Maoist who lives in Shanghai with special permission from the Chinese government as a \u201cfriend of the Party,\u201d works closely with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and state media to help spread pro-Chinese government propaganda, according to athe New York Timesinvestigative report in August 2023. Singham reportedly manages this by donating to various groups and news organizations through his non-profit groups and shell companies. Following the NYT report, then-Senator Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and Senator Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) wrote to then-U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland, asking him to open an investigation into Singham\u2019s dark money operations for potential violations of the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA). Biden\u2019s Justice Department took no action. The American-born tech entrepreneur reportedly helped finance the pro-Hamas encampments and student uprisings that began at Columbia University and spread to other campuses last year. Over the weekend, data expert @DataRepublicanreported on Xthat Singham has funneled over $20 million into far-left organizations in the U.S. though his dark money network. \u201cThanks to the investigative work of Data Republican, House Oversight will issue a formal document request to Neville Singham regarding his funding of a communist group linked to the LA riots and the CCP,\u201d Rep. Anna Paulina Luna (R-Fla.) wrote on X Tuesday evening. She added: \u201cIF HE REFUSES TO APPEAR, HE WILL BE SUBPOENAED, AND IF HE IGNORES THAT HE WILL BE REFERRED TO THE DOJ FOR PROSECUTION.\u201d In a short video posted on social media, Luna asserted that the PSL is only using the immigration issue as a political wedge to promote its Communist agenda. In response to Data Republican\u2019s posts, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), a member of the House Oversight Committee, signaled what questions could be asked of the Marxist multi-millionaire. \u201cIs this war on ICE and America being funded by Neville Singham. Is it being funded by China? Was BLM riots funded by China? Are Antifa Communists funded by China? Are the cartels linked? This is an actual war being waged against our country,\u201d Greenewrote on X. Singham is married to Marxist antiwar agitator Jodie Evans, 70, who co-founded Code Pink with Medea Benjamin in 2002 to protest the Iraq War. In 2020, Evans launched a \u201cChina Is Not Our Enemy\u201d campaign, leading a series of webinars on Code Pink\u2019s YouTube page where she praised China\u2019s \u201cbeautiful history\u201d and Communist political structure. Singham was once\u201ca big fan\u201dof Venezuelan Communist dictator Hugo Chavez, describing the beleaguered country under his rule (February 2, 1999 to April 11, 2002 and April 14, 2002 to March 5, 2013) as a \u201cphenomenally democratic place.\u201d On Wednesday, several leftist groups, including PSL, planned to hold \u201cICE-OUTs\u201d in American cities, includingEugene, OregonandSeattle, Washington. **Get the news corporate media won't tell you.** Get caught up on today's must read stores! \u0394 **About Debra Heine** Debra Heine is a conservative Catholic mom of six and longtime political pundit.
