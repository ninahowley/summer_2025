Among the details included in Harvard\u2019smotion for summary judgementsubmitted yesterday in the university\u2019s lawsuit challenging Trump\u2019s effort to defund the university (there are two lawsuits \u2014 theone regardingTrump\u2019s campaign to retaliate because Harvard refused to cede its independence, and theone respondingto Kristi Noem\u2019s denial of visa for Harvard students) is a description of how Pete Hegseth\u2019s agency cut off DOD grants without informing DARPA that the \u201ctop performing team\u201d onan effortto detect and deploy countermeasures to biohazards had been arbitrarily and immediately cut off. The motion quotes the effort DARPA\u2019s director of contracting made to reverse the cuts, to no avail. Harvard is currently the top performing team on the AMPHORA program. Inadequate knowledge of the biological threat landscape poses grave and immediate harm to national security. Development of critical technologies that enables bio surveillance and biocollection in austere, field forward locations bolsters national security and warfighter safety and lethality by enabling medical countermeasure development to new and emerging threats and provides biological threat intelligence to the deployed warfighter. This technology is significantly outpacing the state-of-the art and provides a novel leap-ahead capability to the force. Harvard\u2019s effort is at a pivotal juncture in Phase 1 as they are just starting the microfluidic experiments that will give first indications of whether the program goal is achievable. They are also a critical integrator of multiple technologies that enable this effort and could not be readily reproduced. Pete Hegseth just did what Trump told him to do \u2014 cut off Harvard \u2014 with no consideration of how it undermines his claimed effort to make military more lethal. National security took a back seat to Trump\u2019s maniacal effort to get Harvard to bow down to his demand to turn the country\u2019s most storied institution of higher learning into a bureaucracy replicating MAGAt ideology. Harvard\u2019s motion mentions \u2014 and adeclarationfrom Harvard\u2019s Vice Provost for Research, John Shaw, lists far more \u2014 of the other benefits to American taxpayers that Trump arbitrarily took away. As a breast cancer survivor, I would personally benefit from a $7 million grant supporting research \u201cto find and describe early changes in breast tissue in women that may be at a higher risk of breast cancer.\u201d As someone who lost a parent to Parkinson\u2019s, I might personally benefit from efforts to \u201cidentify[] numerous modifiable risk factors for Parkinson\u2019s disease.\u201d We all would benefit from a $2 million effort to better understand resistance to antibioticsawarded by the (second) Trump administration. Gone. All of those benefits and many more have been stolen from taxpayers who\u2019ve already sunk billions into this research. And yet, with few exceptions (an important one isa NYT story, cited in the motion, describing how the cuts will disrupt efforts to prevent veteran suicides and otherwise improve healthcare for veterans) this is not how the story of Trump\u2019s emotional tantrum against Harvard is being told. \u201cHarvard Digs In for Battle, but Trump\u2019s Blows Are Landing,\u201d WSJ described a boxing match when reporting the visa ban for Harvard students. \u201cWhy is Trump going after Harvard?\u201d WaPo promised to answer, instead explaining, \u201cHere\u2019s how the attacks have escalated,\u201d even while treating wrestling booster Linda McMahon\u2019s claimed pretense of fighting antisemitism in good faith. Their timeline missed several important details that show up in Harvard\u2019sown timeline(submitted with the motion for summary judgement): notably: Harvard did a bunch of things to address antisemitism on campus Plans announcedby Task Force on Antisemitism Senior Counsel, Leo Terrell, way back on October 24, 2024, to defund Harvard The Trump Administration\u2019s persistent disinterest in the things Harvard had done to address antisemitism The Trump Administration\u2019s persistent silence about any single instance of antisemitism on Harvard\u2019s campus \u2014 the kind of due process to which Harvard would respond on Title VI Having not presented the pretext of antisemitism as such, WaPo doesn\u2019t ask how revoking the visas all foreign students at Harvard, including those of61 Israeli students, combats antisemitism. Politico similarly glosses the significance of all this in what is mostlya process storyof Trump\u2019s efforts to \u201cbrainstorm new Harvard measures.\u201d Trump is seeking to \u201cbring the storied institution to heel.\u201d The Administration will need to \u201cget more creative to keep squeezing the school.\u201d When it contemplates the \u201cTrump administration\u2019s broader efforts to reshape not just American government but the institutions that have long surrounded it,\u201d Politico did not mention how that effort includedan ignorant effortto defund Politico subscriptions, to say nothing of Trump\u2019s other assaults on the press. NYT has been reporting a series of \u201cescalations.\u201d \u201c[T]he administration appeared eager to escalate one of its civil investigations into a criminal inquiry,\u201d Mike Schmidt and Michael Benderdescribeda manufactured outrage that would backfire if it were criminally charged.The fight escalated, Mike Schmidt said in an interview. This was a sharp escalation,NYT set upanother Schmidt interview. Cutting off visas was a major escalation,Schmidt and Michael Bender described. \u201cTrump Administration Escalates Harvard Feud With New Justice Dept. Investigation,\u201d another headline blared. Mike Schmidt, who always seems to reinforce Trump\u2019s power, keeps insisting that, \u201cHarvard Has No Way Out,\u201d without thinking through what that would mean for the US, if true. Schmidt apparently can\u2019t imagine a political setback so significant \u2014 a backlash from taxpayers about the value Trump took from them, a value that Schmidt doesn\u2019t consider \u2014 that Trump would realize he has to fund Harvard research just like he has to keep Air Traffic Controllers on the job. Politico, at least, quotes one of several administration sources describing that the mere futility of Trump\u2019s efforts when public opinion swung to Harvard when Trump revoked the student visas (it made no mention that that included visas for Israelis). \u201cWe\u2019re fighting a losing battle,\u201d one of the administration officials said, acknowledging that the university has the narrative upper hand when it comes to the effort to revoke Harvard\u2019s student visas. \u201cWe\u2019ve taken one of the most evil institutions and made them the victim.\u201d But there remains no question about the way Trump has deliberately hurt Americans \u2014 not just elite Americans whose kids go to Harvard, or poorer Americans, whose Harvard tuition foreign students subsidize, but the Americans who benefit from the cancer cures and biohazard warnings and ways to combat antibiotic resistance. Dan Drezner, from his perch just down the road from Harvard at Tufts,arguesthat Schmidt\u2019s pessimism about Harvard is all wrong, that Harvard is winning this battle. Over the weekend, however, some news stories have come out that reinforce a few points about how these attacks are going. The administration has already shot its wad in going after Harvard and has very little left in its cupboard. This anti-Harvard jihad is not going exactly as planned, either legally or politically. The Trump White House has now reached the same point in its dealing with Harvard that it previously reached in its trade negotiations with multiple countries: desperate for a victory that may never come. This is not to say that Trump is not wreaking carnage. He\u2019s wreaking atremendousamount of carnage. What he is not doing, however, is winning. Part of Drezner\u2019s optimism is that academics, both within Harvard and across the institutions, have discovered collective action. WhatKlein\u2019s storyomits is that after astumbling startatcollective action, the administration\u2019s actions havegalvanizeda lot of universities to talk to each other about response strategies. The fundamental lesson to be learned from Trump\u2019s actions to date is that no matter how a university responds, Trump will be coming after them anyway. That comes through loud and clear in all the coverage. And if university leadership knows this, they will choose standing their ground over backing down every day of the week. From my own limited view of how higher education is responding, I see discussions about how to respond to further pressure from the Trump administration. I also see that none of the response strategies on the table include \u201ccut a deal.\u201d Where I depart from Drezner\u2019s optimism, and concede Schmidt has a point, is that unless this senseless battle imposes a cost on Trump, Harvard will ultimately lose, American taxpayers will ultimately lose the sunk costs in research and jobs that Trump decided to take away. Because until those resisting Trump \u2014 from the lawyers to the universities to the local nonprofits and yes even the media outlets \u2014 actually win the underlying battle, Trump remains in a position to take away those cancer cures. And that \u2014 not Wharton grad Trump\u2019s claim of Harvard snobbery and not the billionaire\u2019s concerns about elitism and sure as fuck not a concern about antisemitism \u2014 is why Trump keeps doubling down. Harvard has the means and the facts to win the legal cases before it. Without even telling the story of the cancer cures Trump took away, Harvard also has the means to look like less of an asshole than Trump. But that\u2019s a different thing from turning Harvard\u2019s fight \u2014 and the collective action that has arisen \u2014 into a political win. This is not about universities. Or \u2014 asI tried to visualize last week\u2014 universities are not what people think they are. Universities do a lot of the same kind of things Elon Musk does, but with nowhere near the grift, corruption, and \u2014 yes \u2014 the antisemitism. This is not a boxing match, a wrestling match, or a series of escalations. This is about a broader fight for civil society. Perhaps journalists, from their very privileged position within civil society, will be the last to figure this out, to understand that all those escalations against Harvard are really inseparable from the \u2014 thus far \u2014 more successful escalations against the press. But what is going on is a two-bit dictator is willing to take things away from the American people all so he can lord over an entity that dared stand up to him. biff murphysays:June 3, 2025 at 3:58 pmWe are all Harvard.Peterrsays:June 3, 2025 at 4:35 pmKareem Abdul-Jabbar agrees with you.From the Harvard Gazette:In early 1956, the Rev.

Hey, it\u2019s capitalism. Yes and: For many neurological conditions, they are dependent on not-for-profit academic centers for: contributing to the underpinning basic research (NIH/NSF money, also some nonprofit foundation money); clinical trial design; and, crucially, to be sites that conduct the clinical trials including all of the participant recruitment/enrollment and oodles of work. Contracts for clinical trials have been grossly under budgeted for years, with successful sites leaning on NIH indirects (which can be much higher at elite private institutions compared to others), donor money, and donated academic scientist time in the name of advancing cures. I was recently specifically asked by for profit sponsor to be closely involved in a clinical trial at my home institution, so I gave them an estimate for 3% effort for a block of time roughly $15K. Response: best they could do is $2K over 2 years, otherwise the site budget was just too expensive. Yet there are multiple for profit companies feeding off the parent sponsor, from lab testing to Clinical Research Organization (CROs) who then \u201cmanage\u201d the academic sites \u2013 layers and layers of it. We need a hard look at how and why tax payer dollars get turned into profits, instead of pharma funding clinical trial conduct to the necessary level for success and thus benefit to all.So I agree, the science is cool and we need lots of pharma effort in this space. At the same time, the orange cloud of chaos is covering the for profit leveraging of tax payer funded work.
