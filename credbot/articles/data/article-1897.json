Recently, he has proposed the idea that within \u201cthe next few years,\u201d it could be possible to feed an AI a character\u2019s synopsis, and have it produce all their dialogue. He believes this would enable even a development team of just ten people to produce a game on the scale ofThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. RELATED:SAG-AFTRA Files Unfair Labor Practice Charge Against Epic Games\u2019 \u2018Fortnite\u2019 Over AI Darth Vader In an interview withIGNduring the Epic\u2019s State of Unreal 2025 conference, Sweeney championed the idea that AI prompts will be \u201ca fundamental part\u201d of game engines, resulting in \u201centirely new genres of games invented that weren\u2019t possible or practical before.\u201d Sweeney went onto to elaborate on how far AI could go for games\u2019 development. \u201cEvery significant advance in technology has led to the rise of new games. I remember 3D gaming just became possible, and thenDoomandWolfensteinintroduced the 3D shooter. The battle royale genre itself only became possible when you had enough performance on hardware and engines that you could have a hundred players in a single play space,\u201d Sweeney recapped. \u201cAI characters giving you the possibility of infinite dialogue with a really simple setup for creators means small teams will be able to create games with immense amounts of characters and immense and interactive worlds,\u201d Sweeney proposed. \u201cWhat would it take for a 10-person team to build a game likeZelda Breath of the Wild, in which the AI is just doing all the dialogue, and you\u2019re just writing some character synopsis? That\u2019s totally going to be within reach over the next few years.\u201d Though the idea of a programmer or level-designer writing dialogue in a large-scale games studio seems silly, Sweeney\u2019s comments do hold merit when considering developers in smaller teams have to take on more roles. If Sweeney\u2019s idea works as he imagines, an indie developer could introduce as much dialogue into their project as they like.

There\u2019s also a demand for AI characters, as theMyRobotKickstarter campaignachieved 391% funding\u2013to the tune of $78,000. The developers argued their game would be \u201cthe first good character simulator that uses AI.\u201d AI-generated dialogue in its current form is far from perfect, however. While SAG-AFTRA demanded a cut fromAI Darth Vader inFortnite, the age rating of the game made it a necessity for the Sith Lord to be a bit nicer to players (and out of character). Players also delighted in tricking the NPC into swearing and other inappropriate comments. Others have cautioned against AI replacing human creativity, or seeing originality stamped out in the industry. Such calls have come fromLevel-5 CEO Akihiro Hino,NieRseries director Yoko Taro,Zero Escapeseries creator Kotaro Uchikoshi, andPlayStation boss Hermen Hulst. There\u2019s also the ethical concerns of replacing writers\u2013part of the reason theWriters Guild of AmericaandSAG-AFTRAwent on strike in 2023. Sweeney had confidence AI would be of benefit to the industry, however, despite how it could be abused. \u201cI see AI as technology that\u2019s ultimately there to empower human creators to create stuff more efficiently. I think that\u2019s a good thing.\u201d RELATED:Nintendo Denies Using AI-Generated Images For \u2018Mario Kart World\u2019 \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that the advent of modern AI has been tainted by companies just ripping massive amounts of content off of other companies and individuals on the web. But as a base level technology, it should be a multiplying factor and multiplying force on our abilities,\u201d Sweeney insisted. \u201cCertainly enabling indie teams to build bigger and better games means also enabling AAA teams to build staggering, immense huge games and to polish it ever further,\u201d Sweeney admitted. \u201cSo I think there\u2019s going to be a massive evolution as everybody scrambles to learn new skills as you get on top of what\u2019s possible here. But I think as with any other technology that\u2019s improved our lives, the ultimate net opportunity for people is higher.\u201d Sweeney and Epic Games are unlikely to relent from AI, and aren\u2019t going to be hoarding their advances to themselves. \u201cWe\u2019re taking what we learned from Darth Vader and sharing the underlying technology with the creator community,\u201d Epic games stated, while revealing the \u201cPersona Device.\u201d This will be a feature of the Unreal Editor forFortnitefor developers and players tocreate NPCs with AI personalities that players can interact with.
