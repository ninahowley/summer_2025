Emails **Trending:** **Indigenous Stewards Reclaim Prison Land** Activists in eastern Kentucky are forcing the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) to go back to the drawing board mere months after the federal agencysigned off on a Record of Decisionapproving a 500-acre site in Roxana, Kentucky, as the location for a $500 million medium-security prison. On Jan. 22, theAppalachian Rekindling Project (ARP), a community-building and land restoration organization led by Indigenous women, announced that it purchased a section of the site the BOP identified as its first choice for the new prison. With the acquisition of 68 acres of private land, the ARP aims to heal the land and the local community\u2014in part by stopping the prison from ever getting built. \u201cThis land has already seen so much harm in the strip-mining industry and has already been out of access [to] environmental care and tending,\u201d said Tiffany, one of the leaders of ARP who declined to use her last name for privacy and safety reasons. \u201cThe thought of adding another extractive industry\u2014one that extracts people from their communities and extracts labor out of them\u2014was really horrifying to us.\u201d The land purchase, made with the help of the Institute to End Mass Incarceration (IEMI), comes after 20 years of back and forth between the federal government and residents of Letcher County, the eastern Kentucky municipality with a population of 21,000 where the prison was originally intended. The saga began in 2006, when Republican Rep. Hal Rogers requested that the BOP evaluate the potential for a new prison in Kentucky, citing the need for an economic stimulus. Ten years after, the BOP approved $500 million for a new prison built atop a former mountaintop coal-removal site. In 2018, a small coalition ofrural organizers succeededin forcing the agency to table the project. By then it was clear that the BOP preferred to spend the funds improving aging prison infrastructure rather than on building new prisons. Also concerning to locals was that most of the initial cost for the Letcher County facility was slated for preparation of the land, as mountaintop removal sites require extensive remediation. \u201cThe last time [Donald] Trump was in office, he did speak out vocally against this project; he thought it was a wasteful allocation of funds,\u201d said Joan Steffen, an attorney at theInstitute to End Mass Incarceration. She toldPrismthat the Department of Justice has consistently asked for the earmarked funds to be taken out of the agency\u2019s budget. This is why it was a surprise when in 2022, the BOP announced that it was revisiting the project\u2014this time under the guise of constructing a medium-security facility. When the agency released the Record of Decision in late 2024, locals assumed it was the end of the road for any resistance, despite significant gaps inthe agency\u2019s environmental justice analysis. But throughout 2024, the ARP quietly organized and collected funds for the purchase. Tiffany also met with the landowners multiple times and built a relationship with them, finding common ground in that they were both born and raised in Letcher County. The landowners even knew her mom. She emphasized the importance of community ties in Appalachia, explaining that her deep roots in Letcher County resonated with landowners. There\u2019s no chance that the ARP will sell to the BOP, Tiffany toldPrism. This means that the federal government has to reconsider its plan and reevaluate potential sites for prison construction\u2014a lengthy and bureaucratic process that can take years. Meanwhile, the price tag for a new construction project will balloon beyond what the agency wants to spend. In this latest iteration of the fight against the prison in Letcher County, organizers hoped to articulate not just what they are against, but what they are for. \u201cRematriation is a solid strategy for abolition,\u201d Tiffany toldPrism. One of the hopes of organizers is toreturn bison to the land. The animals were once ubiquitous throughout the Midwest and Appalachia until they were hunted into extinction for the purpose of rendering Indigenous life unlivable. They also plan to plant native and non-native plants like persimmons, pawpaws, and grasses, both as food sources and as natural flood prevention. Of course, they\u2019ll also need to hire local people to put up fencing for the bison, help plant and restore the area, and manage other projects. The ARP\u2019s approach to economic development and land care offers a tangible alternative to the promises made by the region\u2019s congressman. Rogers insisted that a prison would result in jobs and a local boost to the economy. However, locals worried about the educational requirements for correctional officer positions as well as mounting evidence that prisons depress local economies. In one study of how the introduction of prisons affected rural Central Appalachian communities, researchers found that poverty rates remained just as high as before construction. The federal agency, Appalachian Regional Commission, lists the Kentucky counties where three federal prisons have opened under Rogers\u2019 tenure as \u201cdistressed.\u201d Recent research from the Prison Policy Initiative also found that chronic understaffing at prisons and jails isn\u2019t effectively countered by promises of pay increases or workplace benefits. In other words, the growing body of research contradicts the purported reasons for constructing prisons. \u201c\u200bIt\u2019s become something that [Rogers] is so ingrained towards establishing that his ego will not let him let go of it,\u201d said Artie Ann Bates, a resident of Letcher County and organizer with the coalition group Concerned Letcher Countians. \u201cI think when someone is so driven to acquire something that they no longer listen to logic or reason or dissenting voices, then that\u2019s a problem.\u201d But it\u2019s not just claims about jobs that concern local residents like Bates; it\u2019s also that the BOP appears to have no comprehensive plan for issues such as flooding. Eastern Kentucky and much of Central Appalachia faced catastrophic flooding in 2022. This includes Roxana, where the Letcher facility was planned for. Not only have the impacts of mountaintop coal removal increased streamflow, bringing greater amounts of contaminated water at faster paces through Kentucky\u2019s mountains and hollers, but when disaster strikes, prisons rarely have adequate plans for how to evacuate people in their custody. \u201cFolks who are incarcerated really do get bottom-of-the-barrel treatment,\u201d Bates said. \u201cThey\u2019re sort of the forgotten population.\u201d Bates has a different view of Letcher County\u2019s potential for economic revitalization. She\u2019d like more mental health services provided to locals and to see an economy based on regenerative agriculture. The ARP\u2019s acquisition is a great place to start. For her it also offers another benefit: healing. \u201c[Concerned Letcher Countians] think that it will be the kind of growth and development that will provide the nexus for young people to learn Indigenous practices and restorative use of the land,\u201d Bates said. \u201cIt\u2019s economically good. It\u2019s ecologically productive, it\u2019s culturally positive. It\u2019s the beginning of righting a wrong that started 500 years ago.\u201d This story originally appeared inPrism. **Inspiration in Your Inbox** Sign up to receive email updates from YES!
