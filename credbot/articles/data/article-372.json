**Trinity Christian\u2019s Josalyn Phillips named Class A first team all-state after leading Warriors back to state tournament** CHARLESTON \u2013 Pendleton County\u2019s Baylee Beachler saw her 2024 campaign come to an end after tearing a tendon in her shoulder at the end of that regular season. The injury kept her from throwing until December but when she returned this year there was no indication of a setback in the circle, where she went 19-1 with a 158 strikeouts and a 1.13 ERA, or at the plate where she batted .558 with 12 home runs and 65 RBI. Her standout campaign helped Pendleton capture the Class A state championship and now Class A first team all-state captain honors, as selected by the West Virginia Sports Writers Association. Beachler isn\u2019t alone, joined by fellow Wildcat Avery Townsend who batted .563 with 10 home runs and 50 RBI. \u201cThose two kids, if there ever is an A and an A-plus, it\u2019s those two kids,\u201d Pendleton head coach Eric Crites said. \u201cThe only advantage is Baylee pitches too. They\u2019ve been the 1-2 in my lineup all year long and they work so well together. They\u2019re such great kids that don\u2019t let their athletic abilities get beyond what they need to do as team leaders. I think that\u2019s what sets them apart from everybody else. They understand they\u2019ve got to make their other teammates better and they work very hard during practice and during games. \u201cIf they see someone making a mistake they\u2019ll show them how to correct it and that was always a pleasure. They were like a second group of coaches on the field for us.\u201d Beachler and Townsend aren\u2019t the only teammates to grace the first team list. State runner-up Wahama placed four on the first team in pitcher Elissa Hoffman, infielder Kalyn Christian, outfielder Audrey Reynolds and utility player Fionna VanMatre. Reynolds batted .551 with four home runs and 38 RBI while Christian added a .505 batting average and .961 fielding percentage. Hoffman led the White Falcons in the circle with an 18-4 record following sectional play. Last but not least to least, VanMatre blasted five home runs with a .460 batting average. Greenbrier West placed three on the first team in pitcher-utility player Brilee Redden, outfielder Maddie Fields and infielder Preslee Treadway. Redden, West\u2019s ace, led the team in batting average (.526), hits (51) and home runs (10) while sporting a 9-9 record with a 2.25 ERA. Fields batted .436 with 35 RBI and four home runs for the Cavaliers while Treadway finished with a .393 batting average and 31 RBI. The final set of teammates to earn first-team honors hail from Mingo County in Tug Valley\u2019s Bailee Hall and Emma Lackey. Hall blasted 14 home runs to go along with a .540 batting average, driving in 38 runs for the Panthers. She also went 13-6 in the circle. Lackey, a freshman, split the pitching duties with a 2.24 ERA and team-best 154 strikeouts. At the plate she batted .400 and drove in 39 runs. Securing the catcher spots are Sherman\u2019s Lexi Lowe and Trinity\u2019s Josalyn Phillips. Lowe batted .505 with 46 hits for the Tide who pushed Wahama in the regional series. Phillips helped Trinity earn a state tournament berth with a .427 batting average and eight home runs. Rounding out the infield are Gilmer County\u2019s Layla Smith and Magnolia\u2019s Jessa Anderson. Smith blasted nine home runs and drove in 47 total runs while Anderson batted .515 with 34 hits. Madonna\u2019s Maddie Owens grabbed the final outfield spot on first team with a .585 batting average to go with 11 home runs and 51 RBI. Wirt County catcher Kylee Ross earned second team captain honors. She was joined by pitchers Mallory McDiffitt (Magnolia), Phoebe Dudgeon (Mount View), Peyton Conley (Madonna), catcher Chloe Orrechio (Madonna) and infielders Katie Hall (Tug Valley), Kalyn Salmons (Tolsia), Paige Montgomery (Gilmer County), Savannah Drake (Sherman) and Lizzie Alt (Pendleton County). Rounding out the second team outfield are Peyton Moore (Trinity) and Summer Harvey (Sherman). The utility players are Jenna Smith (Pendleton County), Susan Vincell (Pendleton), Peyton Hicks (Tucker County) and Emma Russell (Sherman). Wooden plaques in the shape of West Virginia that include the player\u2019s name, school, licensed WVSWA logo, year of the honoree are available to all-state first team, second team and honorable mentions and can be purchased at from the Bear Wood Company throughWVSWA.comorBearwoodcompany.com.
