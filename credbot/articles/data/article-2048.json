The two actors have been tipped to spend big during the transfer window as they look to provide managerPhil Parkinsonwith the backing to improve his squad.Wrexhamhave already been linked with several top flight stars, includingLeicester's Jamie VardyandWest HamduoAaron Cresswell and Danny Ings. The North Wales team are now being encouraged to make a bid forNottingham Forestmidfielder Lewis O'Brien, who impressed on loan atSwansea Cityin the second tier during the latter half of last season. The Swans are said to be interested in signing the 28-year-old permanently after he started 16 games for the club after arriving in January. However, O'Brien still has one year left on his contract and finances are said to be a major barrier preventing him from joining. Wrexham have also been the subject of reports connecting them with a move for O'Brien, and ex-Red Dragons and Swansea aceLee Trundlethinks he would make a big impact at the Racecourse Ground. Speaking on theFearless in Devotionpodcast, he said: \"Lewis wants to play further up the field and go and drive at players and make things happen. I think he would be a great addition. The only thing I would say about Lewis is he's still contracted to Forest, and he would be on a very good contract. \"It's whether the wages could get matched, because I know that was a stumbling point at Swansea. That's the other problem when you move into the Championship, because we're not only talking about the quality of the players, but the wages as well. \"It is a big chance to take on people if you give them a three year contract on so much [money]. That can also hurt you in a way, but I don't think the owners think like that. I do think that they just look forward and everything that they've said, they've been true to their word.\" Next season will mark the first time Wrexham have played in the second tier for 43 years. Some pundits have expressed scepticism over whether they will be able to push for an unprecedented fourth successive promotion. But Trundle said he would not rule out the possibility of Wrexham reaching the Premier League, despite cautioning them over the difficulty of competing in the Championship. He also called on the club's fans to stay united if results don't go their way initially. Welcome to Wrexham is back on Disney+ for a fourth season. Fans can watch the series with a\u00a34.99 monthly plan, or get12 months for the price of 10by paying for a year upfront. \"I don't think it's unrealistic to think that way [about promotion], Trundle said. \"I went to a Bristol City side which had just been promoted out of League One, and we ended up getting to the Championship play-off final that year, where we got beaten by Hull. \"I wouldn't say it's out of reach, especially with the way Wrexham are doing as well. When you're used to winning and you've got a winning mentality, I think that goes a long way.But I would say that there could be some heavy defeats and you're not going to get everything the same way that you've had it for the last couple of years.\" He added: \"The most important thing now is for the fans to realise how far the club has come in that short space of time, and all stick together. You're going to need to strengthen going into the Championship. But I think fans around British football would love to be a Wrexham fan and in the position that the club is in.\" Join our new WhatsApp communityand receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.
