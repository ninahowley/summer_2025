Perhaps people are sick of hangovers, or of losing control of themselves and doing dumb things they regret? Or maybe people have just wisened up to the fact that alcohol consumption is broadly toxic to the body, mind and spirit, creating unnecessary challenges in life? Or, perhaps because of all of these reasons, alcohol is simply losing its cool. In 2017 I penned an article entitled20 Common Things People Realize When They Quit Drinking Alcohol,which has been viewed almost 420,000 times. At the time, I myself was wanting an alcohol free life, but was sill stuck in the old addiction and cultural programming, which had me under the influence of the notion that life without alcohol just couldn\u2019t possibly be any fun. And isn\u2019t that what alcohol is supposed to be all about\u2026 fun? That\u2019s a lie, and odd isn\u2019t it that something so ubiquitous in our world, something so universally depended on, and so accepted as necessary to daily life, is also so widely recognized to be the most self-destructive, and socially dangerous substance in our world. As I write this today I am nearing 2 years of sobriety from alcohol, and life just keeps getting better. I wrote this post to give inspiration and encouragement for any spiritual seekers out there who are challenged to let go of social and emotional dependency on alcohol. It\u2019s a subject which comes up quite often in my coaching practice, and I always advise my clients to get this poison out of the way so that they can get a clear picture of what is holding them back and driving them to self-sabotage. Here are some of things I\u2019ve learned in these past years by letting go of my addiction to alcohol. If any of this resonates with you, and if you\u2019re seeking clarity and independence from alcohol or anything else slowing you down,book a FREE 15-minute callwith me and I\u2019ll put all of my attention on any problems or challenges you are presently facing. There is a reason we drink, but we don\u2019t know what that reason is until we stop drinking. Alcohol consumption in any quantity is spiritual decay. There\u2019s really no middle ground here. It takes time to recover from the spiritual, mental, and emotional effects of drinking. It will be at least a full year before your clarity fully returns. It\u2019s nearly impossible to overcome serious challenges with alcohol in your life. It\u2019s just too confusing and chaotic to see the truth. People who do drink will often tell you how great it is that you don\u2019t drink. Why, what are they really saying? They\u2019re saying that they wish they had sufficient self-control to give it up, but they don\u2019t. Drinking definitely causes anxiety, and it takes a long period of sobriety for your nervous system to recalibrate and the anxiety to leave. Not drinking in social situations requires a very deep commitment to yourself, but your soul is waiting for you to step up. It requires tremendous courage to face the emotional reality of life without the crutch of booze. You see clearly the effects that your drinking has had on the people you love. You notice how unattractive people are when they are drunk. You can clearly sense a shift in those close to you when they drink. You can sense subtle changes in their personality and mood. You get to a point where sobriety means everything to you, and it becomes a prized and treasured possession worth defending. You cannot control other people\u2019s decision to drink. All you can do is set an example. The right people will notice the changes in you, and they will comment. When they do it will give you fuel to keep going. Children really notice what happens to people when they drink, and they really appreciate it when their parents abstain. You\u2019ll be more present for the moments and experiences in life that really matter. Not drinking is broadly viewed as a noble and righteous way to live, but so few do it? Why? Because most are too weak, and since alcohol kills strength, it\u2019s a self-defeating cycle. Drinking is akin to letting your inner child take control of your life and run it into the ground. You save a ton of money. You\u2019ll look better, feel better, sleep better, think better, and appreciate life a lot more. The drama in your life drops significantly, and things that used to bother you are non-factors. You get off the dopamine roller coaster and after time begin to return to a baseline of easiness and confidence. Things don\u2019t affect you as strongly, and you bounce back much more quickly after an emotional challenge. It is a challenge to find new friends and new relationships when you don\u2019t drink, because so many people depend on alcohol for social connection. But they are out there. You are less agitated, less, rushed, less critical, and less afraid of the world. Life becomes extraordinarily less dramatic. The main emotions that drive alcoholism are guilt, shame, abandonment, rejection, frustration, anger, and resentment. It truly is one day at a time. There is no need for promises to yourself, because they don\u2019t work. Just focus on today. Waking up the morning without alcohol induced anxiety is a true blessing and absolutely priceless. Cravings for alcohol originate from problems that you are unable or unwilling to resolve. In other words, you\u2019ll crave booze more when you\u2019re faced with something that requires the best in you. When you learn to overcome challenges without booze the cravings and desire for booze disappear. It\u2019s likely that you\u2019ll want to replace alcohol with something else like cannabis or sweets. This is the same emotional condition driving you to self-medicate, which is what you\u2019re really seeking to understand. Your emotional intelligence increases dramatically. Your less likely to catastrophize, and less likely to indulge in self-pity. Your much less affected by other people\u2019s moods, helping to end co-dependency. You\u2019ll need much less validation and approval from others. You often wake up and after a minute realize that your sober with no hangover and it just feels like a genuine blessing. Each and every time. Before you became addicted to alcohol you became addicted to set of negative emotional patterns. You won\u2019t be able to understand this without considerable time sober, but when you do, every area of your life will drastically improve, and you\u2019ll finally experience the fullness of your personal power. Overcoming the original emotional addiction that drove you to drinking will require more courage than anything else you\u2019ve experienced. Your higher self is in control more often than your lower self. The pleasure just isn\u2019t worth the pain. In order to solidify my sobriety and reprogram my mind to love an alcohol free life, I\u2019ve often found it inspiring to listen to the stories of celebrities and interesting people who\u2019ve conquered this demon in their lives. I\u2019ve attached a great inspirational video on this below. My hope is that if you\u2019re struggling with alcohol, or if you\u2019ve realized that drinking does not serve your highest self, then this post gives you the motivation you need to conquer your fear and put your own life and happiness above everything else.
