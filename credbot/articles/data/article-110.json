It took a special session to complete the job after the regular session ended in May with much undone. With a firm deal in hand, lawmakers churned through sprawling bills one after another and wrapped up their work. **Email newsletter signup** The House beat the Senate to the finish line, adjourning at 10:40 p.m. after about 12 hours of work. Senators clocked out around 1:55 a.m. \u201cFrom the very beginning, this has been a hard-fought session,\u201d Senate President Bobby Joe Champion, DFL-Minneapolis, said as he drew things to a close. \u201cAnd to get here we ultimately had to forge relationships and compromises that are not always easy.\u201d The closely divided Legislature \u2014 there are 101 DFLers and 100 Republicans \u2014 had some skirmishes over priorities and spending levels. \u201cWe were charged with doing a state budget for the people of Minnesota. That is what we have done,\u201d Republican House Speaker Lisa Demuth said, adding, \u201cI know this was successful because we were able to get the work done \u2014 not quite on time, but before a government shutdown.\u201d She noted that a tied House for only the second time in state history made it impossible for either side to have its way. House DFL Caucus Leader Melissa Hortman concurred. \u201cMinnesotans expect that when Democrats and Republicans are elected to co-govern in the state Legislature that we would compromise and get things done and fund their state government,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s exactly what we did.\u201d An education budget offered schools some fiscal stability in this budget but laid the groundwork for cuts in a couple of years. A nursing home and disability services budget clamped down on fast growth. New or increased fees are sprinkled throughout the budget. A tax plan bumped up charges on cannabis products and a related measure reframed regulations on data centers. None of the special session debates were more intense than a bill to strip health insurance coverage from immigrants in the country without legal status. Undocumented immigrants who are adults will lose eligibility for the premium-based MinnesotaCare program after December while children will remain eligible. Republicans said the restriction was imperative because state costs for care are ballooning. \u201cI think for most Minnesotans, this issue is quite simple. We shouldn\u2019t be incentivizing illegal immigration to our state by making it easy, providing taxpayer funded benefits and looking the other way when someone came here to break our laws at a time when we\u2019re facing cuts,\u201d said Sen. Jordan Rasmusson, R-Fergus Falls. Democrats took issue with the cost estimates, noting that the MinnesotaCare program requires buy-in by the recipient. They said it wouldn\u2019t end the need for health care but would cause some people to put off preventative care or just go to emergency rooms that can\u2019t turn away patients even if they can\u2019t pay. \u201cThis is a horrible priority. It\u2019s a horrible thing to do to people, to call them illegal, to say they don\u2019t matter, to say that their taxpayer dollars somehow don\u2019t exist, that their families don\u2019t matter, that their pain and their suffering doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d said Sen. Erin Maye Quade, DFL-Apple Valley. The bill passed with the minimum number of votes needed to clear the House. Hortman was the only DFLer to cross over to vote with Republicans, a necessity of the budget deal she signed her name to. \u201cI\u2019ll continue to have health insurance, so I\u2019m fine,\u201d Hortman said after the session ended, her voice cracking. \u201cWhat I worry about is the people who will lose their health insurance. I know that people will be hurt by that vote.\u201d Similarly, DFL Senate Majority Leader Erin Murphy also voted for it while disparaging the aim of the proposal. She was joined by three Democrats from swing districts. The coverage removal applies only to adult immigrants; children will retain the coverage after Jan. 1. For the most part, lawmakers breezed through consideration of the budget bills. Some were outlined and passed within 30 minutes; others took a bit more time. Gov. Tim Walz was out of sight on Monday but never really far from mind. Some Democrats jabbed at him for agreeing to the MinnesotaCare change for immigrants. Rep. Maria Isa Perez-Vega, DFL-St. Paul, was gaveled out of order when she tried to start a chant of \u201cThis ain\u2019t One Minnesota\u201d during the House floor debate, mocking a Walz campaign slogan. House Education Finance Committee Co-Chair Ron Kresha, R-Little Falls, faulted Walz for letting the state\u2019s finances get squeezed to the point where the education budget could be in for a $400 million-plus cut in the budget after this one. \u201cI would urge the governor to stop going around the country and showboating and get back here and look at what\u2019s in front of you,\u201d Kresha said. \u201cLook at the policies that we have. Stop touting that you\u2019re the education governor, when you forced $420 million cuts on us.\u201d This budget starts to identify places where costs could be trimmed if the fiscal picture doesn\u2019t improve. Kresha\u2019s DFL counterpart, Rep. Cheryl Youakim of Hopkins, said the budget at hand makes thoughtful adjustments. \u201cA cut budget was hard to work with,\u201d she said. \u201cWe did our best to keep the majority of the cuts away from directly in the classroom.\u201d Among the items in the education bill is a task force to look at ways to account for growth in special education costs and have it report back to the Legislature soon. Walz will have his say yet this week as the bills start officially arriving to his office. He\u2019s expected to sign the entire package given that he was a signatory to the final deal. **New grant may help scientists change the fight against liver cancer** **Grillin & Chillin event raises money for Humane Society and prospects for expanded event** **Special session convenes to vote on rest of Minnesota budget, avoid shutdown** **A place to call home: Austin pickleball group continues work toward funding public courts** Construction UpdatesConstruction UpdatesSeptember 16, 2021 **Construction Updates** Construction UpdatesSeptember 16, 2021 **Construction Updates** **Construction Updates** Construction UpdatesSeptember 16, 2021 **Construction Updates** **Construction Updates** Southern Minnesota News Collection **Southern Minnesota News Collection** **Southern Minnesota News Collection** Home News Sports Opinion Spotlight Obits Classifieds Small Business About Us Policies News Tip Photo Subscriptions Email Customer Service \u00a9 2025, Austin Daily Herald"}
