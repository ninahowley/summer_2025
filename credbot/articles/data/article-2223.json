Sources say the FBI began investigating Stallings over reports that he was stealing more than a million dollars a year from the University of Pittsburgh and, in the process of that investigation, uncovered the coach\u2019s attempted bribes. \u201cHe asked random passersby in the street, former Pitt season ticket holders, even his secretary and the school\u2019s athletics director to simply attend a Pitt basketball game and stay for the entire thing in exchange for $100,000 in cash\u201d said a person with knowledge of the investigation. \u201cYet they all turned him down.\u201d It is not clear yet if the FBI will charge Stalling with a crime for his actions, only that FBI agents found his behavior \u201cpretty hilarious.\u201d \u201dHe\u2019s kind of a national laughingstock,\u201d said one FBI source. \u201cPutting him in jail isn\u2019t necessary. He\u2019s been disgraced enough already.\u201d **Also see \u2026Report: NCAA considering death penalty for NCAA** **Related Content** **Recent Posts** **NFL Division Winner Odds for 2024 Season** The Kansas City Chiefs and San Francisco 49ers remain the red-hot favorites to win the Super Bowl in... **Home Run Heroes: Celebrating St. Louis Baseball Legends** St Louis is one of the few American cities to produce a lineage of legendary baseball players who... **Carabao Cup setup for an all star final** There\u2019s plenty to look forward to in England\u2019s other cup competition, the Carabao Cup.
