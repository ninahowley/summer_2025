Though it was founded more than half a century ago, nearly all the subjects it raised and debated continue to feel urgently relevant. To wit, \u201cDear Ms: A Revolution in Print\u201d opens with narration from founding editor Letty Cottin Pogrebin: \u201cTry to imagine life where you are owned by, or controlled by, men.\u201d There are, perhaps, some women who can still imagine what that might be like today. Directors Salima Koroma, Alice Gu and Cecilia Aldarondo are well aware of the timeliness of their subject and subtly allow us to draw parallels even as they take us back to the 1970s. They\u2019ve chosen to split the film into three chapters, with each director telling a different part of the magazine\u2019s story. This tripartite structure does make the film feel somewhat fragmented, but many of the participants and themes carry throughout. Koroma\u2019s section, about the magazine\u2019s founding in 1971, introduces us to the women we will get to know as things progress. Foremost among them is Gloria Steinem. At the time, Steinem was alternating between political and celebrity journalism. She was probably most famous for her expos\u00e9 of Hugh Hefner\u2019s Playboy Club, in which she went undercover as a Bunny. But she was also writing work like \u201cPaul Newman: The Trouble With Being Too Good-Looking.\u201d Then she went to cover a women\u2019s liberation meeting for New York magazine. The experiences participants shared \u2014 about being overlooked, overworked, over it all \u2014 convinced Steinem that this movement deserved far more than a single article. And so the first issue of Ms. was actually an offshoot of New York, an experiment built on no small amount of uncertainty. Steinem was, in fact, one of the few public figures brave enough to call herself a feminist aloud, and we see her using her mainstream beauty \u2014 which is commented on by the media repeatedly \u2014 as a way to subvert expectations of \u201cradical liberation.\u201d (Which is to say, equality.) We do see a few other celebrities standing strong, including Lily Tomlin, Lucille Ball and Alan Alda. But Koroma also shows us the overwhelming backlash that met the magazine immediately. This general disdain is crystalized by unabashedly dismissive ABC news anchor Harry Reasoner: \u201cThe first edition of Ms., described as a new magazine for women, is at hand and it\u2019s pretty sad,\u201d Reasoner announces to his millions of viewers. \u201cIt\u2019s so clearly just another in the great but irrelevant tradition of American shock magazines.\u201d Reasoner then shares his certitude that it\u2019ll fold imminently. He was wrong, of course: Ms. still exists, and has lasted longer than many of its contemporary publications. We learn about its early successes \u2014 and stumbles \u2014 in Alice Gu\u2019s chapter, titled \u201cA Portable Friend.\u201d As Steinem notes, women\u2019s magazines at the time \u201cwere mostly catalogues that served to praise the advertisers\u201d \u2014 advertisers being cosmetics companies, weight-loss pills and household appliance makers. In contrast, Ms. was often alone in generating widely-viewed discussions of abortion, sexual harassment, domestic violence, power dynamics and \u2014 ultimately \u2014 revolution. Should it have been so revolutionary to suggest that women deserved to be treated with fairness? Regardless, it certainly was. And so the magazine started getting piles of mail, from countless women expressing gratitude at finding support for the first time, and from countless men expressing fury at the challenge to their households\u2019 sexist status quo. Gu also delves deeper into intersectionality, a concept that required a great deal of education for the mostly-white, mostly-straight, middle-class editorship. Indeed, the film is often at its best when it expands beyond the magazine\u2019s conference rooms to explore more about the history and history-makers of the era, including Alice Walker, Shirley Chisholm and Essence (and later Ms.) editor-in-chief Marcia Ann Gillespie. In Part Three, Aldarondo takes us further into sex and sexuality (sample Ms. cover line: \u201cErotica and Pornography: Do You Know the Difference?\u201d). She too uses the opportunity to start with a relatively simple theme, and travel outwards. So a chapter on sex is a chapter on gender, work, politics and economics. It\u2019s also a history of culture clashes, and we learn a lot about the feminist movement\u2019s internecine battles, between women like erotic filmmaker Candida Royale and anti-porn activist Andrea Dworkin. Oddly, after going so deep into the magazine\u2019s history, the film wraps up very abruptly; a single line tells us what\u2019s happened to it over the last 25 years. This does also emphasize an overarching lack of cohesion between the three chapters, which never quite mesh in a fluid way. The general takeaway, though, is that this is a fascinating, complex story that needs to be told. And all three directors make great use of both archival footage and contemporary interviews. At one point, we hear someone ask a young Steinem just who it is she\u2019s trying to reach. \u201cEverybody,\u201d she responds. And in 2025, that\u2019s also who should see this maddening, inspiring and still-so-significant documentary. **Subscribe to Breaking News.** **Comments** **Latest Magazine Issue** **TheWrap** About Us Advertise Contact Careers Masthead Newsletters WrapBook **Wrap Pro** Subscribe Team Plan Learn More **Legal** Terms of Service Privacy Policy AdChoices **Wrap Magazine** Cannes College Emmys Oscars Advertise With Us **Follow Us** Visit The Wrap on facebook Visit The Wrap on twitter Visit The Wrap on instagram Visit The Wrap on youtube"}
