According to LAPD sources, the individuals \u2014 identified as Grayson, Skye, and \u201cComrade Terry\u201d \u2014 were initially picked up for inciting a riot, throwing vegan yogurt at mounted officers, and gluing themselves to the sidewalk while chanting, \u201cNo justice, no feet.\u201d After a few hours in custody and one round of gluten-free jailhouse chili, all three allegedly confessed they were being paid to protest. \u201cThey told us Soros was behind it,\u201d said LAPD Deputy Joe Barron. \u201cAt first we assumed they meant one of the nonprofits. But nope. They said George and Alex themselves. Like\u2026 personally.\u201d In sworn statements now sealed in a mayonnaise jar on Art Tubolls\u2019 front porch for safekeeping, the trio claims that George Soros personally Venmo\u2019d them $275 each with the memo \u201cFor Freedom \ud83d\ude0a.\u201d Alex, not to be outdone, allegedly sent DoorDash credits and a Spotify playlist of revolutionary sea shanties. Legal analysts say the charges could be serious if there\u2019s any truth to the claims \u2014 and if you squint hard enough and ignore logic, there just might be. \u201cTechnically, this could fall under federal influence peddling and incitement,\u201d said legal expert Sheila Barron, \u201cif, and only if, these kids aren\u2019t just making it up to get out of community service.\u201d But according to the LA District Attorney\u2019s Office, the charges are already in the works. \u201cWe\u2019re treating this like Watergate, if Nixon had worn black eyeliner and thrown tofu bricks,\u201d said DA Assistant General Joe Barron Jr. \u201cIf we can link Soros to a cash app and a kombucha-fueled riot, it\u2019s game over.\u201d Critics say the case is weak at best and fabricated at worst. A spokesperson for the Soros family issued a brief statement: \u201cGeorge Soros is currently at home watching Hungarian sitcoms and crocheting peace scarves. Alex is in Ibiza trying to figure out if NFTs are still a thing. Neither has time to Venmo rogue anarchists in Silver Lake.\u201d But that hasn\u2019t stopped certain members of Congress from acting like it\u2019s already confirmed. \u201cSee? I told you!\u201d said Rep. Lauren Boebert from the floor of the House. \u201cGeorge Soros is behind everything. Antifa, TikTok, the birds \u2014 all of them! WAKE UP!\u201d As for the protesters, all three have entered protective custody, currently hiding out in the back of a Whole Foods near the hummus aisle. In other news, a fourth protester, who goes only by \u201cLaserDawn,\u201d turned out to be a performance artist filming a documentary about radical tofu as an allegory for late-stage capitalism. She has since been released on her own recognizance and a coupon for 20% off essential oils. God Bless America."}
