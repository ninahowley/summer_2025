When a big story breaks, we know they will be on top of it. Michal Kapral Content Manager at Impax Media says: For our digital signage network of screens in grocery stores, we needed quality, local-oriented news in French with daily pictures and text via FTP. The Canadian Press fulfilled that mandate when others could not. Their stories are sourced very thoughtfully \u2013 they\u2019re timely, interesting, sometimes fun, not offensive and the pictures are excellent quality. We\u2019re also able to filter out content our customers don\u2019t want using keywords. The service and tech support are very good, and the pricing is competitive. Rona Katz Senior Creative Director at Neo Traffic says: We have digital screens in shopping centres across Canada, including Montreal. We needed sports and entertainment news headlines with photos for our screens. Neo Traffic was looking for something affordable and it was important to have English and French Canadian news. We also wanted real-time updates, so when news breaks, it\u2019s on screens right away. Getting all this content from one provider is the biggest benefit of working with The Canadian Press. They deliver news content in a way that works well for digital signs.
