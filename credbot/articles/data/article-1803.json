The Russians and the Chinese have both been developing new intercontinental ballistic missiles that can cause such immense destruction that they make the nuclear bomb that destroyed Hiroshima look like a child\u2019s toy. The U.S. has been working on a new intercontinental ballistic missile, too, but it won\u2019t be ready for quite a few years. Unfortunately, we are closer to nuclear war right now than we have been at any other point in human history. In fact, we are extremely fortunate that the Russians didn\u2019t decide to just start launching their nukes after Ukraine\u2019svery foolish surprise attack on Russia\u2019s nuclear bombers. If there had been a surprise attack on our nuclear bombers, we may not have shown the same level of restraint. We are literally teetering on the brink of the unthinkable, and it is so important for the general population to understand what we are facing. According to a brand new report that was just released, in our world today, there aremore than 9,600 nuclear warheadsthat are ready to be used\u2026 The number of nuclear warheads ready for use by nine countries has slightly increased from last year, reaching over 9,600 warheads, according to a Japanese think tank\u2019s report. Russia, the United States and China remain the world\u2019s three largest countries in terms of the size of their nuclear arsenals. As I haveextensively documented, a full-blown nuclear war would be cataclysmic. A large portion of the U.S. population would be immediately wiped out, and even more would die from famine during the subsequent nuclear winter. Sadly, most of the population doesn\u2019t even realize we just had a really close call. President Trump\u2019s envoy to Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, just explained to Fox News that Ukraine\u2019s assault on Russia\u2019s nuclear bombers resulted in risk levels\u201cgoing way up\u201d\u2026 \u201cI\u2019m telling you, the risk levels are going way up \u2013 I mean, what happened this weekend,\u201d Trump\u2019s envoy, Keith Kellogg, told Fox News. \u201cPeople have to understand in the national security space: when you attack an opponent\u2019s part of their national survival system, which is their triad, the nuclear triad, that means your risk level goes up because you don\u2019t know what the other side is going to do. You\u2019re not sure.\u201d Our continued existence literally depended on Russian President Vladimir Putin showing some restraint. Fortunately, Putin didn\u2019t press the button this time. But do we really want to keep living on the edge like this? We need to find a way to make peace while we still can. Unfortunately, it appears that peace is slipping away. President Trump was just asked about imposing more sanctions on Russia, and he responded by saying that\u201cwe\u2019ll be very, very tough\u201dif Russia doesn\u2019t end the war\u2026 President Donald Trump was asked again on Thursday when he will make a decision regarding sanctions on Russia, which he\u2019s threatened repeatedly over the past several weeks. \u201cIt\u2019s in my brain, the deadline,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWhen I see the moment where it\u2019s not gonna stop \u2026 we\u2019ll be very, very tough. And it could be on both countries, to be honest. It takes two to tango.\u201d Of course, the Russians are in no mood to compromise after what the Ukrainians just did. In fact, there are some voices in Russia that are calling for nuclear weapons to be used. Here isjust one example\u2026 The Kremlin\u2019s recently updated nuclear doctrine \u2013 which sets out conditions for a launch \u2013 states that any attack on \u201ccritically important\u201d military infrastructure which \u201cdisrupts response actions by nuclear forces\u201d could trigger a nuclear retaliation. The Ukrainian operation was \u201cgrounds for a nuclear attack,\u201d declared Vladmir Solovyov, a firebrand host on Russian state TV, calling for strikes on the Ukrainian presidential office in Kyiv, and beyond. Most people living in the western world don\u2019t realize this, but the Russian \u201cSatan-2\u201d missiles are the most advanced nuclear missilesin the entire world\u2026 Russia\u2019s \u201cSatan-2\u201d missile, also known as the RS-28 Sarmat, has earned its infamous name from the West for its sheer destructive potential. This intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) is capable of carrying multiple nuclear warheads \u2014 up to 15-16 \u2014 and is capable of wiping out entire cities. The updated RS-28 Sarmat missile, considered an advanced version of Satan-2, has an increased range of 13,000 to 16,000 kilometers, making it one of the most powerful missiles in Russia\u2019s arsenal. This missile\u2019s capacity to cause mass destruction is unparalleled, capable of obliterating several cities with a single strike. One \u201cSatan-2\u201d missile can carry enough firepower to destroy an area roughly the size of the state of Texas. Meanwhile, the Chinese have developed a new intercontinental ballistic missile that has a range of7,500 miles\u2026 China has revealed details of its new nuclear weapon which is said to be 200 times more powerful than the bombs that devastated Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The DF-5B missile is said to have a range of 7,500 miles, meaning it is capable of reaching Europe and the United States from launch sites in China. Like Russia\u2019s \u201cSatan-2\u201d missile, this new Chinese ICBM is capable of deployingmultiple reentry vehicles\u2026 Its Multiple Independently Targetable Reentry Vehicle (MIRV) technology enables a single missile to carry and release a number of nuclear warheads capable of striking different targets across a wide area. The original DF-5 was equipped with only one warhead, but the DF-5B can reportedly carry up to 10, significantly boosting its strike capability. We have no defense against such missiles. If the Russians or the Chinese press the button, we will be toast. Accordingto Zero Hedge, the commander of Edwards Air Force Base recently warned that the local community needs to be prepared for the possibility of a catastrophic surprise attack\u2026 Last month, the commander of Edwards Air Force Base, California, talked openly about the need for local leaders to prepare for a Pearl Harbor-like strike on his base and others inside the United States. Brig. Gen. Doug Wickert delivered \u201ca sobering assessment of China\u2019s growing military capabilities\u201d in a briefing to community leaders, according to an Air Force press release. Wickert, the 412th Test Wing commander, spoke at Antelope Valley College on May 7. Edwards Air Force Base is located in the Mojave desert about 100 miles northeast of Los Angeles. Wickert referenced the 1941 Pearl Harbor attack in his briefing, the press release said, drawing parallels to warnings about Pearl Harbor\u2019s vulnerability prior to the attack. As I have warned many times, U.S. military bases will be primary targets if a nuclear war erupts. We are counting on our strategic nuclear arsenal to deter the Russians and the Chinese, but right now, Minuteman missiles that originally went into service in the 1970s still form the backbone of that arsenal. The new Sentinel intercontinental ballistic missile is in development, and preparations for its deploymentare underway\u2026 According to information published by the 5th Bomb Wing Public Affairs on May 30, 2025, the US Air Force officially launched preparations at its nuclear installations to accommodate the upcoming LGM-35A Sentinel intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). The activation of a new specialized unit, the Sentinel Site Activation Task Force (SATAF) Detachment 12, at Minot Air Force Base in North Dakota marks a pivotal moment in the effort to replace the aging Minuteman III, which has served as the land-based pillar of the US nuclear triad since 1970. This initiative is part of a broader strategic modernization plan focusing on strengthening the ground-based leg of the nuclear deterrent force. That is the good news. The bad news is thatit will be yearsbefore the new Sentinel intercontinental ballistic missile is ready\u2026 The Sentinel program, originally designated as the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD), is designed to deliver a next-generation ICBM featuring advanced security technologies, cyber resilience, and modular architecture. Sentinel will be deployed in a single-warhead configuration, with initial fielding scheduled to begin in 2029. Until the new W87-1 warhead under development by the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) becomes available, the Sentinel will be armed with legacy W87-0 warheads. The NNSA is also scaling up its capability to produce 80 plutonium pits per year by 2030 to meet program requirements, having already qualified the first war reserve pit for the W87-1 in October 2024. Until the Sentinel is in service, we will be at a serious disadvantage. When I asked Google AI if Russia\u2019s S-500 air defense system can shoot down a Minuteman missile, this is the response that I got\u2026 Yes, the S-500 air defense system is designed to intercept and destroy a wide range of aerial threats, including ballistic missiles like the Minuteman ICBM. But we don\u2019t have anything that can shoot down the new missiles that the Russians and the Chinese have developed. So perhaps we shouldn\u2019t be picking fights with the Russians and the Chinese while they are holding the upper hand. Of course, the vast majority of the population does not understand any of this, and that is extremely unfortunate.
