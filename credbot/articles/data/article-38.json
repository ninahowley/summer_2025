The Sheriff\u2019s Office said the 14-year-old student reported that the teacher sent him an explicit photo. The Sheriff\u2019s Office said school administration was informed of the allegations, and detectives started an investigation. According to the Sheriff\u2019s Office, after obtaining a search warrant and getting permission to access data from phones and social media accounts, detectives discovered evidence indicating that the communications led to lewd conduct involving the victim. \u201cMy son bravely and with great courage reported this horrific abuse to the school administration,\u201d Hernandez said during public comment at Tuesday\u2019s meeting. \u201cHe was not met with protection, support, or compassion. He was called a liar by the principal at Haile Middle School and met with a severe punishment of a 10-day suspension.\u201d District leaders said they can\u2019t comment on student disciplinary issues because they\u2019re private and protected under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). The Sheriff\u2019s Office said on May 12, detectives received more evidence to strengthen the case. The school district said Fell was reassigned on May 14 to a position without contact with students. Last week, Fell was arrested and charged with lewd contact with a student by an authority figure, a second-degree felony, and transmission of harmful material to a minor, a third-degree felony. \u201cWe take this very seriously,\u201d said Interim Superintendent Kevin Chapman. ABC Action News received the message sent from the school\u2019s principal to parents last week, which read in part: \u201cIt took several weeks of investigation to confirm the allegations of the illegal communications. Once law enforcement had sufficient confirmation, our school and district were informed and Ms. Fell was immediately reassigned to a position away from our school where she had no contact with students.\u201d On Tuesday, the school board voted unanimously to fire the teacher. \u201cIf you have a problem working in our district and you don\u2019t know where that line ends and begins with a student, you don\u2019t need to be in our classroom, period,\u201d said School Board Member Cindy Spray. The school district reiterated in a statement to ABC Action News that student safety is the highest priority. \u201cI really recommend that parents have those uncomfortable conversations with their kids early on because if I hadn\u2019t, he probably wouldn\u2019t have spoken up, and he does know right from wrong, and so I\u2019m glad he did, and I\u2019m just here to support him,\u201d Hernandez said. The School District of Manatee County shared the following statement on Tuesday:\"The School Board of Manatee County voted unanimously today to terminate Haile Middle School ESE Teacher Oliver Fell. Ms. Fell was arrested and charged on Tuesday, June 3, 2025, with lewd contact with a student by an authority figure, a second-degree felony, and transmission of harmful material to a minor, a third-degree felony. The highest priority of the School District of Manatee County is student safety. While we do not typically comment on matters which are still under investigation by law enforcement, the details of this case, as described in the Manatee County Sheriff\u2019s Office Press Release on June 3rd, are alarming and contemptible for anyone serving as a school teacher. The District and school have been and will continue to fully cooperate with law enforcement throughout this active investigation. The district is also cooperating with the Florida Department of Education regarding appropriate state action toward the teacher\u2019s future certificate status.\" Pasco County woman trying to rebuild mobile home after hurricanes \"I cried, of course, because I've worked very hard getting it nice, which has been difficult for me since I lost my husband and being alone,\u201d Kelly Welty said.Welty's mobile home lost its roof during Hurricane Milton.
