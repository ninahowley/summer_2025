Education **Amid ICE raids, L.A. schools say they\u2019ll protect students at graduation. But will their families come?** Some parents in the district \u2014 which includes an estimated 30,000 immigrant students \u2014 plan to sit out commencements over immigration enforcement concerns. Nadra Nittle Education reporter Published Republish this story Share Bluesky Facebook Email Republish this story What was supposed to be a day of celebration for students at Gratts Learning Academy for Young Scholars turned into one of chaos as immigration enforcement in and around Los Angeles \u2014 along with subsequent protests and attempts to quash them \u2014 reportedly left some of their relatives too fearful to attend the elementary school\u2019s graduation. Gratts is in the city\u2019s Westlake District, where immigration raids Friday led to a showdown between demonstrators and law enforcement agencies that persisted throughout the weekend. Altogether,at least 56 peoplewere arrested in the L.A. area. In Downtown Los Angeles, near Westlake, the sight of blazes on several blocks \u2014 after riot police lobbed flashbang rounds at crowds, and protesters set off fireworks and torched cars \u2014 called to mind the wildfires that ravaged the region at the start of the year. President Donald Trump on Sunday deployed the National Guard in this deeply blue city that opposes his mass deportations policy, a move that critics \u2014 including former Vice President Kamala Harris \u2014 argued intensified confrontations between protesters and the authorities. Commuters driving to work on Monday morning saw what remained of the clashes \u2014 self-driving Waymo cars burnt to crisps and graffiti tagged all over downtown businesses and buildings. The 19th thanks our sponsors.Become one. Schools are still reeling from the raids and the unrest, with commencement ceremonies set to continue this week. Officials acknowledge that many families in the district \u2014 which includes an estimated30,000immigrant students \u2014 plan to sit out commencement because of concerns about immigration enforcement. LAUSD Superintendent Alberto Carvalho described that decision as \u201ca heartbreak\u201d during a news conference Monday. More from The 19th Fourteen years in America. A one-way ticket to El Salvador. She\u2019s devoted her life to teaching your kids \u2014 in a country that now wants to deport her \u201cI\u2019ve spoken with parents who\u2019ve told me that their daughter will be the first in their family to graduate high school, and they\u2019re not going to be there to witness it because they have a fear of the place of graduation being targeted,\u201d Carvalho said. \u201cWhat nation are we? Who in their right mind would accept that reality?\u201d Fears have been stoked by unfounded rumors such as the one that emerged on Friday that an immigration raid took place at Gratts\u2019 graduation. \u201cThe claims that immigration enforcement activity arrived at the school and during the event are false,\u201d an LAUSD spokesperson told The 19th. The superintendent, an immigrant from Portugal who was formerly undocumented, said the district is taking steps to protect each graduation site, whether on or off campus. The school police will \u201cestablish perimeters of safety\u201d around graduation locations and intervene if any federal agency tries to disrupt the ceremonies, Carvalho said. \u201cWe\u2019ve instructed our principals to not create lines, to not restrict access,\u201d he said. \u201cAs soon as [families] come, they will enter the venues where the graduations are taking place, reducing the risk for them while on the street waiting to get in. We also have authorized the principals to allow parents to remain at the venue for as long as it takes should there be any immigration enforcement action around the area where the graduations are taking place.\u201d School police will also remain on site well after the ceremonies end to allow parents to exit safely. And, in limited capacities, the district will create opportunities for families to watch their children graduate via Zoom. Carvalho said that the recent raids and unrest happened at the worst possible time, given that over 100 graduation ceremonies will be taking place throughout LAUSD Monday and Tuesday, the last day of school. Still, he said the district is prepared to protect students, staff and families. \u201cEvery child has a constitutional right to a public education,\u201d he said. \u201cTherefore, every child and their parent has a right to celebrate the culmination of their educational success.\u201d United Teachers Los Angeles (UTLA), the woman-led labor union representing Los Angeles Unified educators, has also spoken out against the immigration enforcement that took place in Los Angeles last week. \u201cThe ruthless targeting of hard-working people by ICE and law enforcement agencies is not only unjust but cruel,\u201d the union saidin a statement pinned to its Instagram page. \u201cThey are using violence and scare tactics to detain people who are simply trying to live and support their families. We will not stand for this.\u201d On Monday, United Teachers Los Angeles organized a rally to stand up for immigrant communities and to protest the arrest of union leader David Huerta, president of Service Employees International Union (SEIU) \u2013 United Service Workers West and SEIU California. Huerta was arrested Friday while observing an immigration raid at a Los Angeles garment factory. He has been charged with felony conspiracy to impede officers and could face up to six years in federal prison if convicted. \u201cWe need more people to continue to be loud about these attacks by ICE,\u201d the Los Angeles teachers\u2019 union said. \u201cHistory has taught us that we cannot afford to stand idly by while our community members are being ripped away from their schools, homes, neighborhoods and workplaces.\u201d Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, the nation\u2019s second-largest teachers union, also expressed her outrage over Huerta\u2019s arrest, the detainment of immigrant workers and Trump\u2019s decision to mobilize the National Guard against protesters. \u201cIt is no coincidence that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detained David Huerta and raided the site of a known worker center \u2014 and we, alongside the entire labor movement, are demanding his and others\u2019 immediate release,\u201d Weingarten said in a statement. \u201cThe assault on Los Angeles contradicts all this country stands for. We are a nation made stronger by immigrant workers, stronger by the unions that represent them, and stronger by the rule of law.\u201d Huerta was released from custody Monday afternoon. Kamala Harris criticized the violent repression of mostly peaceful protesters in Los Angeles, singling out Trump for his role in the unrest that ensued. Harris has lived in L.A.\u2019s Brentwood neighborhood since marrying Doug Emhoff in 2014, though she was largely based in Washington, D.C., as vice president. \u201cLos Angeles is my home, and like so many Americans, I am appalled at what we are witnessing on the streets of our city,\u201dshe said in a statement. \u201cDeploying the National Guard is a dangerous escalation meant to provoke chaos. In addition to recent ICE raids in Southern California and across our nation, it is part of the Trump administration\u2019s cruel, calculated agenda to spread panic and division.\u201d The White House, meanwhile, took aim at the protesters, as well as California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, both Democrats. More from The 19th These Ukrainian women banded together after fleeing war. The U.S. may send them back.

Is Trump\u2019s executive order ending birthright citizenship in effect? \u201cRadical left lunatics are taking to the streets of Los Angeles \u2014attackinglaw enforcement,hurling projectilesat police cruisers,burningvehicles, andshutting downfreeways \u2014 because the Trump administration is removing violent criminal illegal immigrants from their communities,\u201d the White House said in a statement Monday. \u201cDemocrats like Gavin Newsom and Karen Bass should be thanking President Trump for stepping up and leading where they refused \u2014 and for ridding their streets of criminal illegal immigrant killers, rapists, and gangbangers.\u201d Rob Bonta, California\u2019s attorney general, sued the Trump administration Monday over its deployment of the National Guard, arguing that doing so infringed on the state\u2019s sovereignty. Los Angeles school leaders say they\u2019re prepared for the Trump administration to escalate immigration enforcement, including on campuses. In January, Trump lifted restrictions on immigration enforcement in \u201csensitive locations,\u201d including schools, churches and hospitals. The policy change has led parents across the country to pull children out of class. During Carvalho\u2019s address on Monday, he said that two federal vans were parked near schools. \u201cNo action has been taken, but we interpret those actions as actions of intimidation, instilling fear that may lead to self-deportation,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is not the community we want to be, that is not the state or the nation that we ought to be.\u201d LAUSD is urging parents or guardians who see immigration activity to contact their school or call the district\u2019s Family Hotline: (213) 443-1300.
