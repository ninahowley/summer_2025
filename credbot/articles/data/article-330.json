Share Comments **Anything imminent at Falkirk?** Could be some big contract news pending. Share Comments **'Hibs latest? Anything in Porto rumours?'** Xavier Simons was up last week but is also talking to other clubs. Should be a decision very soon. It is still the waiting game with Nectarios Triantis and on Rocky Bushiri\u2019s contract. They are also interested in a versatile defender from England who has previous Scottish Premiership experience. Ryan Porteous would be dependent on Rocky Bushiri\u2019s decision. Hibs tried to get him in January but haven\u2019t renewed that interest this summer. They could, however, if Bushiri was to decide he was to move on. Share Comments **Danny Armstrong to Aberdeen?** Danny Armstrong is a player that has been recommended to Jimmy Thelin from within the club. It was first flagged up ahead of January. The manager had other preferences at that point. The one thing is that Aberdeen need to bring in more Scottish players. There are a few clubs interested in Armstrong but the last I head, Hull City were well-positioned. I don\u2019t know if that has changed or not now they are under new management. Aberdeen would certainly have the finances to do it.
