Home\u00bbThe Blood, the Basin, and the Hyssop: A Call to Obedience, Testimony, and Total Victory **The Blood, the Basin, and the Hyssop: A Call to Obedience, Testimony, and Total Victory** Tania Koenig April 20, 2025 Lighthope's Beacon **Related Posts** **I. The Pattern of Passover: Obedience Brings Protection** In Exodus 12, every family in Israel was saved\u2014not by religion, lineage, or heritage\u2014but by one thing: the blood of the lamb applied in obedience. The lamb was slain. The blood was in the basin. But it did not protect a single soul until it was transferred\u2014by faith and obedience\u2014to the doorposts of their homes. And the transfer came through something simple: a little bunch of hyssop. That hyssop represents something powerful in our lives today: our testimony.Paul says in 1 Corinthians 5:7:\u201cChrist, our Passover, was sacrificed for us.\u201d His blood has been shed. The sacrifice is complete. But just like Israel, we must still apply the blood\u2014not with literal hyssop, but by the word of our testimony. **II. Testimony: The Hyssop in Your Hand** Revelation 12:11 gives us heaven\u2019s battle strategy:\u201cThey overcame him [Satan] by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony\u2026\u201d Your confession\u2014when it agrees with God\u2019s Word\u2014is not just helpful. It is essential. It is what transfers the blood from basin to doorpost. It brings the finished work of the cross into living reality. No confession, no High Priest.No testimony, no overcoming.No alignment with God\u2019s Word, no legal authority in the spirit realm. You must speak what the blood has done. And you must speak it in faith. **III. The Sevenfold Sprinkling of His Blood: Fulfilled at the Cross** In the Old Testament, on the Day of Atonement, the high priest would sprinkle blood seven times before the presence of God (Leviticus 16). Every drop was prophetic. Every act pointed to Messiah. Jesus fulfilled it\u2014precisely and painfully\u2014through His suffering: 1. In the Garden of Gethsemane \u2013 His sweat became great drops of blood (Luke 22:44)2. At the high priest\u2019s house \u2013 They struck His face with rods (Mark 14:65)3. They plucked His beard \u2013 Tearing skin and drawing blood (Isaiah 50:6)4. He was scourged \u2013 Flesh torn by bone-laced Roman whips (John 19:1)5. A crown of thorns \u2013 Pierced into His scalp (Matthew 27:29\u201330)6. Nails in His hands and feet \u2013 Crucifixion (John 20:25)7. A spear in His side \u2013 Blood and water flowed (John 19:34) Each wound fulfilled Isaiah\u2019s words:\u201cHe poured out His soul unto death\u201d (Isaiah 53:12).\u201cThe life is in the blood\u2026 I have given it to you upon the altar to make atonement for your souls.\u201d (Leviticus 17:11) The soul is in the blood. And Jesus poured out His soul\u2014His very life\u2014as your substitute. **IV. How to Appropriate the Blood of Jesus** It\u2019s not enough to believe it happened. You must learn to apply it: 1. Know what the Word says about the blood.You cannot testify to something you don\u2019t understand.2. Speak it out loud.Your testimony is the legal transfer from the basin to your life.3. Stay under the blood.Obedience matters. You must remain in the place where the blood has been applied. **V. The Seven Declarations of Victory** These are not just truths\u2014they are weapons. When spoken in faith, they become your hyssop: 1. RedemptionThrough the blood of Jesus, I have been redeemed out of the hand of the devil. (Ephesians 1:7) 2. CleansingWhile I walk in the light, the blood of Jesus cleanses me now and continually from all sin. (1 John 1:7) 3. JustificationThrough the blood of Jesus, I am justified\u2014just as if I had never sinned. (Romans 5:9) 4. SanctificationThrough the blood of Jesus, I am sanctified\u2014set apart for God, made holy. (Hebrews 13:12) 5. ReconciliationThrough the blood of Jesus, I have peace with God. I am no longer far away. (Colossians 1:20) 6. Access to GodThrough the blood of Jesus, I have bold access to the presence of God. (Hebrews 10:19) 7. Victory over SatanThrough the blood of Jesus and the word of my testimony, I overcome Satan. (Revelation 12:11) **VI. The Power of Total Commitment** Revelation 12:11 gives us one final key: \u201cThey loved not their lives unto the death.\u201d These are not casual Christians. These are committed soldiers in the army of the Lord. Total commitment terrifies Satan. The one who is not afraid to die is the one who truly lives. \u201cThe world passes away\u2026 but he who does the will of God abides forever.\u201d (1 John 2:17) We overcome by the blood. We overcome by our testimony. And we overcome by not clinging to our lives\u2014even unto death. **Final Word: Apply the Blood** We are living in prophetic times\u2014days of shaking, sifting, and intensifying spiritual warfare. And yet, the ancient pattern of Passover still holds firm. Christ has died. His blood has been shed. But protection, purity, and transformation only come when that blood is applied\u2014by faith, through obedience, and with the bold confession of our mouths. The blood is in the basin.The hyssop is in your hand.What will you declare? Let the Church arise and speak. Let every believer make the confession of faith that transfers the power of the cross into their daily lives. Let every household come under the blood. Let every father, every spiritual leader, take their place at the doorpost\u2014applying the blood through intercession, through leadership, and through the word of their testimony. Because we overcome by the blood of the Lamb\u2014and by the word of our testimony. This is not just remembrance.This is war.This is victory. Blessed Good Friday and Happy Passover!
