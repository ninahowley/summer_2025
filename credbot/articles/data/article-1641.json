Our principles Inside Xtra The Latest Podcasts **In the face of uncertainty, U.S. queer creatives are building alternatives** Federal cuts are forcing LGBTQ2S+ artists and organizations to scramble for survival 2024 Criminal Queerness Festival at PAC NYC.Credit: Marion Aguas The email arrived late Friday night on May 2. Stephen Motika, director and publisher ofNightboat Books, received notice that his organization\u2019s $30,000 National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) grant had been terminated. The non-profit independent press, which publishes queer and experimental literature, has received NEA grants for more than a decade, which have enabled them to publish works likeWe Both Laughed in Pleasure: The Selected Diaries of Lou SullivanandThe Fifth Woundby Aurora Mattia. \u201cThe NEA is updating its grantmaking policy priorities to focus funding on projects that reflect the nation\u2019s rich artistic heritage and creativity as prioritized by the President,\u201d the email stated. \u201cConsequently, we are terminating awards that fall outside these new priorities.\u201d Nightboat was one of hundreds of cultural organizations across the United States to receive grant termination notices that weekend. \u201cI think the big wake-up now is, do not think these things are small and insignificant\u2014take them very seriously,\u201d Motika says. \u201cWe have to get together and hold our ground, because this is a really terrible precedent.\u201d In February, the NEA announced changes to guidelines for 2026 grants.Organizations cannot be \u201cpromoting\u201d principles of diversity, equity and inclusion or what the administration calls \u201cgender ideology\u201dand grant applicants must agree to follow executive orders from the administration. ForNational Queer Theater, a LGBTQ2S+ theatre collective, these new restrictions pose what founding artistic director Adam Odsess-Rubin calls \u201ca very existential threat.\u201d In March, the New York-based organization joined three other arts groupsin filing a lawsuitto challenge the NEA\u2019s ban on funding projects related to \u201cgender ideology.\u201d Get free Xtra newsletters Xtra is being blocked on Facebook and Instagram for Canadians as part of Meta\u2019s response to Bill C18.

National Queer Theater\u2019s $20,000 NEA grant for their annual Criminal Queerness Festival, which showcases the work of international playwrights from countries where queerness is criminalized, was terminated. The grant represented 20 percent of the festival\u2019s budget and covered artist payments, costumes and set materials for shows by creators from places like Cuba, Indonesia and Uganda. 2024 Criminal Queerness Festival at PAC NYC.Credit: Marion Aguas The impact of the administration\u2019s rollback of DEI extends beyond federal cuts. Odsess-Rubin explains that New York City Pride has reduced funding to partner organizations ascorporate sponsors pull back from Pride eventsand LGBTQ2S+ organizations, since some companies are \u201cafraid of being targeted by the administration over DEI. \u201cThe arts are central to a thriving democracy and America is known for its arts and culture. We\u2019re a beacon, especially for queer artists from all over the world,\u201d Odsess-Rubin says. \u201cAnd now we\u2019re losing that position.\u201d Elizabeth Larison, director of the National Coalition Against Censorship\u2019s Arts & Culture Advocacy Program, says the effects might go beyond immediate funding concerns and into the territory of self-censorship. \u201cI\u2019m seeing a lot of fear and concern among artists and internally among arts organizations,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen there\u2019s a lot on the line in terms of institutional viability, it can be a lot scarier for institutions to feel like they can speak up.\u201d The broader impact, Larison warns, is that \u201cit just pushes a lot of art into the shadows. It doesn\u2019t mean that art will stop; it\u2019s just going to become much less visible.\u201d Beyond the direct effects of funding cuts, some institutions are already making pre-emptive changes without direct government pressure. Andil Gosine, an artist and professor at York University in Toronto, discovered his multimedia exhibition,Nature\u2019s Wild, was cancelled by the Art Museum of the Americas in Washington, D.C., in February. The show, which explores connections between ecology, sexuality and colonial law in the Caribbean through works by a dozen artists, had been planned for three and a half years with funding entirely from Canadian sources. \u201cCalling Card\u201dCredit: Andil Gosine The cancellation came one day after the Trump administration issued an executive order reviewing groups like the Organization of American States, which oversees the museum, to determine if they are \u201ccontrary to the interests of the United States.\u201d No reasons were given for the cancellation. The show was not described as queer in any materials, but Gosine suspects his identity as a queer artist may have influenced the decision. A photograph of him as a child in sparkly shoes was used as the main visual to advertise the exhibition on the museum\u2019s facade, and, according to him, the show had been informally referred to within museum circles as \u201cthe queer Canadian show.\u201d \u201cI am guessing that probably played a part,\u201d Gosine says. \u201cMagna Carta\u201dCredit: Andil Gosine The effects of the new policies also vary by location. Odsess-Rubin says he has \u201cdefinitely seen a lot of self-censorship in more conservative parts of the U.S.\u201d \u201cI think [if] you;re a queer artist or run a theatre in Iowa or Florida, I think these conversations are very top of mind,\u201d he adds, emphasizing that some organizations in more conservative areas are hiring security for events or cancelling programming altogether due to safety concerns. In contrast, he says, organizations in more progressive urban areas like New York tend to have local government support even without federal funding. Motika believes the cuts go beyond arts funding. \u201cI think it opens up a new line of inquiry that is very time-consuming,\u201d he says about navigating political threats. \u201cI really do think we need to be really strong and not give up any ground, even if it could mean harassment and legal repercussions.\u201d National Queer Theater launched aGoFundMe campaignafter losing their NEA grant, and supporters have so far raised over 50 percent of the lost funding. The organization started rehearsals for their festival with 40 artists already hired. Artists affected by the cuts include Jedidiah Mugarura, a Ugandan playwright based in Toronto whose playTomorrow Never Cameexplores themes of power and queerness in post-liberation Uganda. Set in 1987, one year after Uganda\u2019s current government came to power, the play examines broken promises of freedom. Despite the funding cuts and political climate, Mugarura says artists must maintain focus on their essential work. \u201cIf we constantly fixate on the tragedy, we might lose focus on what\u2019s on the ground, on what you must attend to,\u201d they say. The resilience, Mugarura notes, comes from community support: \u201cNo matter what is happening with the NEA and the U.S., there\u2019s a lot of amazing human beings who are saying, \u2018All that negativity, we\u2019re going to move past it and still create.\u2019\u201d Odsess-Rubin says the group is preparing for longer-term impacts too. \u201cWe\u2019re also not expecting any NEA funding for the next four years,\u201d he says. \u201cSo as much as we need to fill an immediate gap, we\u2019re going to need to think strategically and in coalition with other arts organizations about how we gain support for the future.\u201d \u201cArtists tend to be on the front lines of responding to crises, to changing political shifts. Some of the best art comes out of that.\u201d For Nightboat Books, the $30,000 represented just under five percent of their budget. Motika says their publishing schedule is staying in place for now, though they may need to make cuts in other areas. Several private foundations have launched emergency funding programs to offset federal cuts, including theMellon Foundation, theHelen Frankenthaler Foundation and the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts. Despite the challenges, artists and organizations are finding ways to continue their work. Gosine says he doesn\u2019t expect the political climate to reduce artistic creation overall. \u201cI don\u2019t actually feel like it will mean less art,\u201d he says. \u201cIt might mean a different kind of art in spaces, but artists tend to be on the front lines of responding to crises, to changing political shifts. Some of the best art comes out of that.\u201d Nightboat Books is preparing what Motika calls a \u201cstacked\u201d fall publishing lineup. Some of Gosine\u2019s work from the cancelled exhibition will appear in smaller gallery shows in Toronto and Montreal, and National Queer Theater will continue on with the festival. \u201cWe started rehearsals last night,\u201d Odsess-Rubin says. \u201cArtists will continue to create, even outside of state-sponsored institutions, and the government can\u2019t stop people from the act of creation.\u201d Simon Feisthauer Fournet (he/him) is a French freelance journalist based in New York City.
