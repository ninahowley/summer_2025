A clover jewellery set has been recalled by the Office for Product and Safety Standards (OPSS) after finding chemicals which could causecancerand damage organs in the jewellery. Imported from China, the set comes in an unmarked orange box and contains a watch,necklace, bracelet and ring. The product was rejected at the border after a report marked the risk level as \"serious.\" A statement fromOPSSreads: \u201cThe product presents a serious risk as the cadmium content is much higher than the maximum permissible limit. \u201cCadmium is harmful to human health as it accumulates in the body, candamage organsand may cause cancer.\u201d **News** **Costco UK urgently recalls kid's toys with 'serious chemical risk'** **Costco UK urgently recalls kid's toys with 'serious chemical risk'** **Full list of chemicals in your makeup and shampoo that 'risk breast cancer'** **Full list of chemicals in your makeup and shampoo that 'risk breast cancer'** The report also confirmed that the product did not meet the requirements of the REACH Enforcement Regulations 2008. Cadmium has previously been used in various consumer and industrial products as it is known to enhance the shine and colour of pieces. However, it is now heavily restricted in the EU due to its alarminghealth risks. According to theUK Government: \u201cExposure to cadmium for a long period of time may result in damage to the kidneys and bones and may cause cancer.\u201d **Most read in The Sun** **Scarface and Ghostbusters actor dies aged 88 after heart attack** **Scarface and Ghostbusters actor dies aged 88 after heart attack** **Beach Boys founder & rock icon Brian Wilson dies aged 82 after health battle** **Beach Boys founder & rock icon Brian Wilson dies aged 82 after health battle** **Boy, 4, dies inside home with woman, 37, arrested on suspicion of murder** **Boy, 4, dies inside home with woman, 37, arrested on suspicion of murder** **Riot erupts in UK city as '60 masked youths' set fire to car & 'assault cop'** **Riot erupts in UK city as '60 masked youths' set fire to car & 'assault cop'** The clover jewellery is heavily inspired by, and likely presents a cheaper alternative to the popular luxury goods brandVan Cleef and Arpels. The product report describes the jewellery as gold in colour with a black material inset. This bears a striking resemblance to the Van Cleef products which retail for as much as \u00a36,000. This isn\u2019t the first time products have been recalled for containing this harmful chemical. The popular Amazon brand Dervivea was also forced to recall their productsearlier this month, after a report revealed that it also contained cadmium. The product listings were recalled by Amazon, with customers advised to contact the distributor they purchased the product from to request redress. Government guidance states those inhaling or ingesting cadmium are most at risk. Breathing in air with high levels of cadmium can cause \u201ca metallic taste in the mouth, shortness of breath, chest pain, cough and flu-like symptoms.\u201d If you are experiencing these symptoms and are concerned about your health following prolonged exposure to cadmium, you should seek guidance from your GP or contact NHS 111. **Your product recall rights** Chief consumer reporter James Flanders reveals all you need to know. Product recalls are an important means of protecting consumers from dangerous goods. As a general rule, if a recall involves a branded product, the manufacturer would usually have lead responsibility for the recall action. But it's often left up to supermarkets to notify customers when products could put them at risk. If you are concerned about the safety of a product you own, always check the manufacturer\u2019s website to see if a safety notice has been issued. When it comes to appliances, rather than just food items, the onus is usually on you - the customer - to register the appliance with the manufacturer as if you don't there is no way of contacting you to tell you about a fault. If you become aware that an item you own has been recalled or has any safety noticed issued against it, make sure you follow the instructions given to you by the manufacturer. They should usually provide you with more information and a contact number on its safety notice. In some cases, the manufacturer might ask you to return the item for a full refund or arrange for the faulty product to be collected. You should not be charged for any recall work - such as a repair, replacement or collection of the recalled item Cancer (disease) Health warnings NHS Product Recalls **More from The Sun** **Scarface and Ghostbusters actor dies aged 88 after heart attack** **Scarface and Ghostbusters actor dies aged 88 after heart attack** **Beach Boys founder & rock icon Brian Wilson dies aged 82 after health battle** **Beach Boys founder & rock icon Brian Wilson dies aged 82 after health battle** **Boy, 4, dies inside home with woman, 37, arrested on suspicion of murder** **Boy, 4, dies inside home with woman, 37, arrested on suspicion of murder** **Riot erupts in UK city as '60 masked youths' set fire to car & 'assault cop'** **Riot erupts in UK city as '60 masked youths' set fire to car & 'assault cop'** **Follow The Sun** **Services** Sign Up To The Sun About Us Editorial Complaints Policies and Ethics Clarifications and Corrections News Licensing Advertising Contact Us Commissioning Terms Help Hub Topic A-Z Cookie Settings Contact Preferences Sun Jobs Shopping How our Product Reviews team test our products The Times & The Sunday Times Pay to Reject \u00a9News Group Newspapers Limited in England No. 679215 Registered office: 1 London Bridge Street, London, SE1 9GF. \"The Sun\", \"Sun\", \"Sun Online\" are registered trademarks or trade names of News Group Newspapers Limited.
