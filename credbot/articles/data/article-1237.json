Demoulas** **Share this:** Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Facebook Click to share on X (Opens in new window)X Two longtime Market Basket executives who were placed on paid administrative leave by the grocery chain\u2019s board of directors alongside CEO Arthur T. Demoulas called the board\u2019s allegations that they were planning a work stoppage \u201cabsurd.\u201d Joe Schmidt, director of operations, and Tom Gordon, the top grocery supervisor, on Friday addressed the board\u2019ssurprising move to oust Demoulasfrom his position atop the eastern New England grocery chain and place \u201cseveral other employees\u201d on paid leave amid an investigation into allegations of wrongdoing. \u201cIt\u2019s preposterous,\u201d Schmidt said outside a Reading Market Basket. \u201cFrom my understanding, the insinuation is that he was trying to create some type of work stoppage due to a disagreement with the board of directors. That\u2019s just absurd. Nobody would do that.\u201d Schmidt spoke not only to Demoulas specifically, saying that he would never doing what he\u2019s being accused of, but also to himself, saying that he\u2019s a loyal employee who would never try to hurt the business he works for. \u201cI take major exception to it,\u201d Schmidt said of being accused of wrongdoing. \u201cI\u2019m an honorable person. I try hard every day. I\u2019m not perfect, but I\u2019ve done, I think, my share in the business over my 39 years.\u201d He said the board has \u201ctrumped up this allegation of inappropriate conduct,\u201d so that they can oust Demoulas from his position of CEO and president, and \u201cremove individuals that are in support of him.\u201d Schmidt, as director of operations, said he reports directly to Demoulas, along with Demoulas\u2019 son and daughter. He and Gordon said they were informed by the board this past Wednesday that they were being placed on paid administrative leave. On Wednesday, the three-member executive committee of the Market Basket board of directors announced Demoulas, along with \u201cseveral other employees\u201d were placed on leave amid \u201ccredible allegations that Mr. Demoulas began to plan a disruption of the business and operations of Market Basket with a work stoppage.\u201d \u201cThe executive committee believes that [Arthur T. Demoulas] and others have taken these steps as improper retaliation for the board\u2019s directives requiring the CEO to work with the board regarding the most basic corporate oversight and to provide the board access to key employees,\u201d said the board\u2019s statement. \u201cMr. Demoulas has also resisted an appropriate succession plan for Market Basket, asserting that he has the unilateral right to appoint his children to succeed him without any consideration of the view of the board or the majority owners of Market Basket.\u201d The move is reminiscent of the summer of 2014, when Arthur T. Demoulas and his cousin Arthur S. Demoulas engaged in a battle over control of the company, with thousands of Market Basket employees walking off the job for six weeks in support of \u201cArtie T.\u201d Arthur T. Demoulas and his three sisters prevailed in that fight, at the end buying out Arthur S. Demoulas\u2019 share of the company for $1.6 billion. His sisters are now opposing Arthur T. Demoulas, according to a Wednesday statement from spokesperson Justine Griffin. \u201cToday, Mr. Arthur T. Demoulas was ousted from his position as president and CEO of Market Basket by his three sisters and their three appointed board members \u2014 Jay Hachigian, Steven Collins, and Michael Keyes. His daughter, Madeline, and son, Telemachus, and several other Market Basket executives were also placed on leave,\u201d Griffin\u2019s statement said. \u201cUnder Mr. Demoulas\u2019 leadership in December of 2024, the company paid off $1.6 billion in debt that financed the purchase of the company in 2014. The company is currently operating at its peak performance and the notion that this board is going to conduct an investigation is a farcical cover for a hostile takeover.\u201d Schmidt and Gordon said Friday that any protests or employee walkouts in support of Arthur T. Demoulas this time around would be up to the customers, and not them. They said there\u2019s been rumblings of such potential activity that\u2019s making the rounds on social media. In Wednesday\u2019s statement from the board, Market Basket officials warned of the effects of a work stoppage at a grocery chain \u201cat a time of great economic uncertainty for many households.\u201d The 2014 employee walkout was accompanied by Market Basket\u2019s customer base noticeably boycotting the stores. Sales fell more than 90% over a six-week boycott. Both executives who spoke with reporters on Friday said they anticipate being fired, but are hopeful that Demoulas will ultimately be reinstated to his \u201crightful position\u201d as Market Basket\u2019s president and CEO. In 2014, \u201cwhen Arthur was out, the volume of the company tanked, and when he came back, we came right back,\u201d Gordon, a 50-year employee, said. Schmidt added that the board is operating in a \u201cWall Street\u201d kind of way, where \u201cpeople are expendable and cast aside,\u201d and is overstepping its authority. \u201cOne of the problems is the board has severe overreach right now, in trying to take on day-to-day responsibilities of the company,\u201d Schmidt said. \u201cThat\u2019s really not, in my opinion, the responsibility of the board of directors. They\u2019re there to be supportive of management and to make sure the company\u2019s on track.\u201d **Share this:** Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Facebook Click to share on X (Opens in new window)X **RevContent Feed** **Most Popular** FHS alum, NASA geologist visits with ROTC studentsFHS alum, NASA geologist visits with ROTC students **FHS alum, NASA geologist visits with ROTC students** **FHS alum, NASA geologist visits with ROTC students** Strong spring for Fitchburg middle schoolsStrong spring for Fitchburg middle schools **Strong spring for Fitchburg middle schools** **Strong spring for Fitchburg middle schools** Football notebook: Blue Devils have a shot at titleFootball notebook: Blue Devils have a shot at title **Football notebook: Blue Devils have a shot at title** **Football notebook: Blue Devils have a shot at title** Paying homage to a cycling legendPaying homage to a cycling legend **Paying homage to a cycling legend** **Paying homage to a cycling legend** Leominster student\u2019s book drive lifts young cancer patientsLeominster student's book drive lifts young cancer patients **Leominster student\u2019s book drive lifts young cancer patients** **Leominster student\u2019s book drive lifts young cancer patients** \u2018A celebration of the community\u2019'A celebration of the community' **\u2018A celebration of the community\u2019** **\u2018A celebration of the community\u2019** Lunenburg man accused of exposing himself to joggersLunenburg man accused of exposing himself to joggers **Lunenburg man accused of exposing himself to joggers** **Lunenburg man accused of exposing himself to joggers** Firefighters rescue 4 by ladder in 3-alarm fire on Mechanic St.Firefighters rescue 4 by ladder in 3-alarm fire on Mechanic St. **Firefighters rescue 4 by ladder in 3-alarm fire on Mechanic St.** **Firefighters rescue 4 by ladder in 3-alarm fire on Mechanic St.** Massachusetts State Police arrest chase suspect in backyard pool: MSPMassachusetts State Police arrest chase suspect in backyard pool: MSP **Massachusetts State Police arrest chase suspect in backyard pool: MSP** **Massachusetts State Police arrest chase suspect in backyard pool: MSP** Judge sends the wrong messageJudge sends the wrong message **Judge sends the wrong message** **Judge sends the wrong message** **More in Local News** SUBSCRIBER ONLYMassachusetts girls flag football soars to new heights **SUBSCRIBER ONLY** **Massachusetts girls flag football soars to new heights** **SUBSCRIBER ONLY** **Massachusetts girls flag football soars to new heights** Leominster student\u2019s book drive lifts young cancer patients **Leominster student\u2019s book drive lifts young cancer patients** **Leominster student\u2019s book drive lifts young cancer patients** \u2018Act up\u2019 at Stratton Players \u2018Fun Family Improv\u2019 night **\u2018Act up\u2019 at Stratton Players \u2018Fun Family Improv\u2019 night** **\u2018Act up\u2019 at Stratton Players \u2018Fun Family Improv\u2019 night** Family Recipe Box: Strawberry fields forever in Fitchburg **Family Recipe Box: Strawberry fields forever in Fitchburg** **Family Recipe Box: Strawberry fields forever in Fitchburg** 2025 May 30 Subscribee-EditionSign Up For NewslettersMobile Apps e-Edition Sign Up For Newsletters Mobile Apps e-Edition Sign Up For Newsletters Mobile Apps Contact UsPurchase PhotosContestsWork for UsPrivacy PolicyAccessibilitySitemap Purchase Photos Contests Work for Us Privacy Policy Accessibility Sitemap Purchase Photos Contests Work for Us Privacy Policy Accessibility Sitemap ClassifiedsPublic NoticesHomesJobsLocal Guide Public Notices Homes Jobs Local Guide Public Notices Homes Jobs Local Guide MNG Network AdvertisingToday\u2019s Print AdsSpecial SectionsAdtaxi Solutions Today\u2019s Print Ads Special Sections Adtaxi Solutions Today\u2019s Print Ads Special Sections Adtaxi Solutions Subscribe Now Terms of Use Cookie Policy Cookie Preferences California Notice at Collection Notice of Financial Incentive Do Not Sell/Share My Personal Informatio Arbitration MediaNews Group Powered by WordPress.com VIP Copyright \u00a9 2025 MediaNews Group"}
