Home Celebrity Movies Music Television Theater Reviews **Review: Bradley Cooper\u2019s \u201cMaestro\u201d Is a Brilliant But Brutal Major Work with Oscars Written All Over It, Especially for Carey Mulligan** Share Bradley Cooper is a real filmmaker. \u201cA Star is Born\u201d was no fluke. Cooper\u2019s movie about composer Leonard Bernstein is brutal and brilliant. Cooper stars as the genius conductor of great symphonies and the writer of, among other things, \u201cWest Side Story.\u201d Carey Mulligan plays his long suffering \u2014 and that\u2019s an understatement \u2014 Felicia. Each of these actors are so sensational they are guaranteed Oscar nominations. And lots of accolades. What \u201cMaestro\u201d isn\u2019t about is the life of Leonard Bernstein. This is not a biopic. It focuses most specifically on the love story, and the marriage. It\u2019s also largely about Bernstein\u2019s ego, his lack of regard for anyone but himself, and Felicia\u2019s struggle to be free of him and yet remain in his orbit. The relationship is fascinating and devastating and makes for an actual drama. But \u201cMaestro\u201d is not, as I\u2019ve read in some weird pieces, Oscar \u201cbait.\u201d It is what is, a film that will be examined for years to come for its sophistication and accomplishment. The movie begins in a whirlwind as Bernstein, who is clearly gay, falls for Felicia, a Chilean Jewish beauty. Cooper is disarming in his approach both as a director and actor. The pair are so consumed with each other that they don\u2019t just finish each other\u2019s sentences, their dialogue overlaps.. They\u2019re high, giddy on love and the adrenaline of finding soulmates. They marry and have children quickly. Cooper kind of skips through their earliest time together to a quarter of the way in when it\u2019s clear Felicia has accepted that Lenny has a double life she\u2019s resigned to. He\u2019s a huge international sensation, the money has rolled in, they\u2019re living in the Dakota, New York\u2019s most prestigious building. Up to this point, Lenny has fastidiously compartmentalized his life. But with fame and money, he gets sloppy. That outsized ego makes him feel like he\u2019s above pretending about his lovers. Into this mix comes a more permanent boyfriend (played by Gideon Glick, the strange magician from \u201cMrs. Maisel\u201d) whose presence in the family is exacerbated by Lenny\u2019s lack of a filter. There are some set pieces in this film that just blow the roof off. Two that come to mind: Felicia finally losing it in their Dakota bedroom while the Thanksgiving parade goes by outside featuring a Snoopy balloon. Mulligan is devastating. Cooper is every bit her match if not more so, especially when Bernstein is transcendentally conducting orchestras. He seems like he\u2019s levitating, the look of joy on his face is beatific to say the least. You can see why both Steven Spielberg and Martin Scorsese have their names on \u201cMaestro\u201d as producers, regardless of business deals. They know Cooper is the real thing. Netflix has their best film yet, even if it doesn\u2019t win Best Film \u2014 \u201cOppenheimer\u201d and \u201cKillers of the Flower Moon\u201d are Bigger Ideas. But \u201cMaestro\u201d is a tour de force, with performances (Sarah Silverman is outstanding as Lenny\u2019s sister, as is Maya Hawke as Jamie Bernstein) that will live on and on. Of course, the production values are as high as possible, with sets, cinematography all of it steeped in detail and nuance. (Give the makeup department its Oscar now.) But it\u2019s the music, the glorious music, that fills the silences between Lenny and Felicia and becomes its own character. Stay through the end credits. There\u2019s no Marvel-esque scene, but the score is an unmissable grace note to what has come before. Showbiz411 is now in its 13th year of providing breaking and exclusive entertainment news.
