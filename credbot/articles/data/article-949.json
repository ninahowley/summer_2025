Other legislative breakthroughs, includingimmigration reform,are likely to emerge in January. And sometime in the spring, Trump, in all likelihood, will shepherd a$1 trillion infrastructure spending billthrough Congress. But it\u2019s not just Trump\u2019s success on the domestic front that has confounded his opposition. The president\u2019s foreign policy is also showing impressive \u2013 if largely unheralded \u2014 results. None is more significant, perhaps, than the administration\u2019s military campaign against ISIS and Islamic terrorism in Syria and Iraq. During the 2016 presidential campaign, Trump promised totake the war to ISISin a manner that Barack Obama had not. And since taking office, he\u2019s done just that, stepping up the air war, devastating the group\u2019s self-declared Caliphate, and decimating the insurgents\u2019 fighting capacity. The evidence that ISIS is in retreat is overwhelming. Last July theWashington Postreportedthat the Islamic State had lost about 60 percent of the territory it controlled at the peak of its expansion, which would have left a sizable area, mostly in Syria but also Iraq, still to be recaptured. But more recent reports reveal that American-based forces in Iraq and Syria have forced ISIS into a strategic retreat. In early November, for example, ISIS militants withdrew from their last stronghold in Syria, a strategic town near the border with Iraq, following a government offensive that \u201ceffectively left the extremist group\u2019s fighters dispersed in villages and small towns in the desert,\u201d according tooverseaspress reports. Last week, the Pentagonreportedthat ISIS has lost 98% of the territory that once comprised its Caliphate, leaving the group to return to insurgent operations and acts of terror in Western capitals. The latest American intelligence assessment says fewer than 1,000 ISIS fighters now remain in Iraq and Syria, down from a peak of nearly 45,000 just two years ago. In recent press briefings, U.S. officials credit nearly 30,000 U.S.-led coalition airstrikes and regional partners on the ground for killing more than 70,000 jihadists. Why didn\u2019t the Obama administration do more to defeat ISIS? Criticssayit was due to the president\u2019s decision to \u201cmicro-manage\u201d the air war, much as the Democratic president Lyndon Johnson once did in Vietnam. Obama imposed onerous \u201crules of engagement\u201d on coalition forces, ostensibly to more carefully discriminate between military and civilian targets. \u201cThe limitations that were [imposed] actually resulted in greater civilian casualties,\u201d says retired Air Force Lt. Gen. David Deptula, who formerly headed up U.S. Air Force intelligence. Deptula also notes that ISIS-controlled oil supplies weren\u2019t targeted for 15 months beginning in 2014, giving the terror group $800 million in much needed revenue to plot attacks and capture millions of innocents to build up the Caliphate. Military expertscautionthat the war against ISIS is far from over \u2014 but Trump\u2019s escalation has clearly worked. More than half of the latest losses suffered by ISIS have occurred during the past year alone. You might think that would be front-page news in theNew York Timesor the lead story on CNN or MSNBC.
