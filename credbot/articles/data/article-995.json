Riot police from the LAPD confronted protesters as demonstrations spread through the area. Federal agents reportedly targeted locations including a Home Depot in the Westlake District, a clothing warehouse in South L.A., and stores in the Fashion District. Protesters gathered throughout the day, culminating in a confrontation near the Los Angeles Federal Building after nightfall. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass issued a strong rebuke of the enforcement actions, stating, \u201cThese tactics sow terror in our communities and disrupt basic principles of safety in our city.\u201d LAPD officers, equipped with riot gear, tear gas, and flash-bang devices, were deployed in response to what police declared an unlawful assembly. Protesters reportedly hurled debris at officers, prompting the use of non-lethal crowd control measures. The LAPD emphasized it was not involved in theICEraids but acted to prevent civil unrest. Among the detained was labor leader David Huerta of SEIU California, who was reportedly injured while documenting law enforcement activities.
