As global economic growth is slowing, all countries need to mobilize their full productive capacity to confront the confluence of crises besetting them.\u201d The 14 countries with same legal rights for women and men are Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Latvia, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, and Sweden. At today\u2019s pace, it will take several decades to close the legal gender gap across the world, the World Bank says. \u201cThis means that millions of young women entering the workforce today will have to wait until retirement\u2014many even longer\u2014before they get equal rights.\u201d \u201cToday, nearly 2.4 billion working-age women live in economies that do not grant them the same rights as men. The year 2022 marks a low point in one respect: economies adopted the fewest gender-related reforms in more than two decades.\u201d In some economies, moreover, a troubling trend is under way: previously granted rights are being reversed. The report finds that some economies have made legal changes to strip women of existing rights, including the freedom of movement and the ability to get a job. \u201cSome have imposed additional burdens, like the duty of obedience to the husband.\u201d The World Bank\u2019s five main takeaways on change since 1970: Since 1970, the global average Women, Business and the Law score has improved by about two-thirds, rising from 45.8 to 77.1 points. Today, just 14 economies\u2014all high income\u2014have laws giving women the same rights as men, and progress has been uneven across regions and over time. Equality of economic opportunity for women is highest in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) high-income economies, where the average score on the Women, Business and the Law index is 95.3 points, and lowest in the Middle East and North Africa region, where the average score is 53.2 points. Progress across the areas measured has also been uneven, with most reforms in the areas of Workplace and Parenthood. Across all topic areas, most reforms have been issued to address domestic violence, prohibit gender discrimination in employment, and legislate on sexual harassment. Economies with historically larger legal gender gaps have been catching up, especially since 2000. Faster progress is being made in economies that have had historically lower levels of gender equality. This is the case, for instance, in some countries in the Middle East and North Africa, and in Sub-Saharan Africa. Economies that have the highest growth rates in the Women, Business and the Law score include Bahrain, Botswana, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Indonesia, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Togo, and the United Arab Emirates. The catch-up effect has been happening across all areas covered by Women, Business and the Law, but the pace of progress has been uneven. The catch-up effect in closing the gender gap has been strongest in the laws affecting Workplace, followed by Parenthood, Pay, and Marriage. The catch-up effect has been weakest in laws related to Mobility, Assets, and Entrepreneurship.
