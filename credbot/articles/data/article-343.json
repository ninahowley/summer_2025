(Photo: Ilia Yefimovich / Alamy) A police force in England has spent hundreds of thousands of pounds protecting an arms factory owned by Israel\u2019s ministry of finance,Declassifiedcan reveal. Based in Newcastle, Pearson Engineeringmanufactures\u201cmobility equipment to armed forces around the world\u201d, including the British military. The arms firm was acquired by Israel\u2019s state-owned arms giant Rafael in 2022. Its financial recordsshowhow the country\u2019s ministry of finance now has \u201csignificant control\u201d over the company. Documents seen byDeclassifiedreveal Northumbria police have spent \u00a3209,755 policing pro-Palestine protests at Pearson Engineering\u2019s site, as well as at the University of Newcastle since October 2023. The bulk of this money was likely spent protecting the Israeli-owned factory. The data includes just one incident at the university while it covers at least four protests at Pearson\u2019s factory between October 2023 and February 2025. Northumbria police said the \u00a3209,755 in policing costs accounted for a total of 337 hours of police work \u2013 amounting to \u00a3622 per hour. The revelation comes as the UK government sanctions Israel\u2019s finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, raising concerns about the ongoing operation of the factory in Newcastle. Jason Hussein, the vice chair of Newcastle Palestine Solidarity Campaign, toldDeclassified: \u201cWhen activists jam the gears of genocide, they are frequently met with a huge police presence and a disproportionate use of force resulting in the assaults and arrests of peaceful protestors, with Palestinians and people of colour often targeted. \u201cJust a day after the UK sanctioned the Israeli finance minister, business continues as usual and the weapons keep flowing. This factory is not welcome in Newcastle and we urge the UK government to back up their rhetoric with action\u201d. **Pearson Engineering** Chaired by Britain\u2019s former defence and trade secretaryLord John Hutton, Pearson Engineering has been the subject of several pro-Palestine protests since October 2023. In December 2024, activists gathered outside the factory to highlight the presence of an Israeli state-owned factory in Britain. Northumbria police officers rushed in \u201centirely unprovoked\u201d and ordered people to move, according toMiddle East Monitor. A protester from the Palestine Solidarity Campaign said: \u201cIndividuals were dragged along the ground, pushed to the tarmac and grabbed around the throat by police officers\u201d. The site has also been hit by Palestine Action, with activistsclimbingonto the factory\u2019s gatehouse earlier this year and dropping rubble in front of the gates to prevent access. \u201cThe profits that they make, the money that they make here is funnelled into Rafael \u2013 an Israeli-owned weapons manufacturer\u201d,declaredone activist. Rafael\u2019s resources are also shared with its subsidiary. The company\u2019s accounts for 2024note\u201cprogress regarding the transfer of technology from Rafael into Pearson Engineering\u201d, with a turnover of \u00a379 million. **RELATED** **13 British Lords Linked to Israel\u2019s Arms Trade** **13 British Lords Linked to Israel\u2019s Arms Trade** **Bezalel Smotrich** Bezalel Smotrich, who oversees the same Israeli finance ministry which owns Pearson Engineering, was sanctioned by the UK government this week. In a statement, the Foreign Office said Smotrich and national security minister Itamar Ben-Gvir have \u201cincited extremist violence and serious abuses of Palestinian human rights\u201d. It continued: \u201cExtremist rhetoric advocating the forced displacement of Palestinians and the creation of new Israeli settlements is appalling and dangerous. These actions are not acceptable\u201d. UK foreign secretary David Lammy has described Smotrich\u2019s views as \u201cmonstrous\u201d. Smotrich has alsoclaimedhumanitarian aid is only being allowed into Gaza \u201cso the world does not stop us and accuse us of war crimes\u201d. Israel\u2019s goal, he said, was to \u201cconquer, clear, and stay\u201d in Gaza. And last year hearguedthat starving two million Gazans may be \u201cmoral\u2026 but no one in the world would let us\u201d. Smotrich is now subject to an asset freeze, travel ban, and director disqualification \u201cin his personal capacity\u201d, meaning the finance ministry that he oversees has been exempted from UK sanctions. Palestine Action\u2019s Huda Ammori toldDeclassified: \u201cIt seems convenient that the government imposed sanctions on the Israeli minister of finance, but not the ministry itself \u2013 especially as the Israeli ministry of finance owns a weapons factory in Newcastle. \u201cThe government is clearly attempting to protect the Israeli weapons industry and save face by imposing meaningless sanctions. The Israeli government, which is committing genocide, should not be able to own a weapons factory in England\u201d.
