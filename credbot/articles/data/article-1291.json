The rally was sponsored by the American Association of University Professors (AAUP) and arose amid the Trump administration\u2019s continued moves tocutresearch funding across the country andhaltthe enrollment of international students at Harvard. Faculty in attendance held posters with messages including \u201cScience Not Silence,\u201d \u201cEven Harvard Has a Spine\u201d and \u201cHands Off Our Research.\u201d \u201cWe need people like you to remain engaged,\u201d said anesthesiology professor Alyssa Burgart, the co-president of the Stanford chapter of AAUP and an organizer of the rally, in one of several speeches by faculty and students. Organizations such as Tech for Liberation, Stanford Faculty and Staff for Justice in Palestine (FSJP) and the student group Education and Democracy United (EDU) also tabled at the event. \u201cThere have been really startling actions in the national scape\u2026 There have been pressure points on universities to compromise their academic integrity, shut down entire departments and crack down on student protests,\u201d said Turner Van Slyke \u201928, afounderof Stanford\u2019s EDU chapter who spoke at the rally. \u201cAt Stanford, there have been huge cuts to our budget,\u201d Van Slyke added. School deans weredirectedon April 29 to begin simulating budget cuts up to 15% in response to changes in federal research funding. A proposal working its way through Congress couldimposea 21% endowment tax on Stanford. To begin the rally, political science professor Larry Diamond B.A. \u201974 M.A. \u201978 Ph.D. \u201980 criticized Trump\u2019s policies \u2014 which he called \u201cpopulist authoritarianism\u201d \u2014 as \u201cmaking life miserable for anyone in the media, the arts and universities.\u201d Diamond called on students and faculty to oppose Trump\u2019s policies together. The best form of resistance, he argued, was to build alliances across ethnic, political and other boundaries. After professors delivered speeches, the Raging Grannies \u2014 a local activist organization composed of older women \u2014 performed a song about protecting academic freedom and international students. Political science professor Hakeem Jefferson condemned the Trump administration\u2019sbanon international student enrollment at Harvard and itsplansto withdraw $9 billion in federal funds from the school, calling these actions \u201cextortion.\u201d Stanford, he added, should lend greater support to Harvard. \u201cSilence doesn\u2019t protect us, it only emboldens those working to dismantle what we\u2019ve worked so hard to build,\u201d he said. Jefferson also argued for the importance of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) efforts, saying that Stanford must continue to acknowledge the varied identities of students and faculty. In another speech, law professor Shirin Sinnar J.D. \u201903 called attention to the number of non-American professors who now question whether they can continue to teach about politically charged subjects like Palestine or climate change due to fears of government retaliation or deportation. Sinnar also advocated for the protection of undocumented and international students, many of whom are hesitant to publish their work and concerned about receiving even minor legal infractions \u2014 like traffic violations \u2014 for fear of deportation. Many professors and students echoed her concern for international students. If Trump broadened his ban on international students, Van Slyke said, \u201cIt would be a really sad turning point in America\u2019s openness to the world and our acceptance to foreign perspectives.\u201d Diamond stressed the importance of international students in facilitating America\u2019s scientific and technological innovation. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)revokedthe visas of six current Stanford students and two recent graduates on April 4. By April 27, seven of the eight visas had beenrestored. Many speakers ended with a call to action for both University leaders and the wider community. \u201cAt some point, neutrality becomes complicity,\u201d Jefferson said.
