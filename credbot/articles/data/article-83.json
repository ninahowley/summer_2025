The speaking event is being organized by the so-called \u201cFree Speech Club\u201d at the University of British Columbia, a Rightwing group that uses the cover of \u201cfree speech\u201d to host far Right figures who oppose the \u201cfree speech\u201d (and the very existence) of Muslims, feminists, Leftists, etc. while promoting white supremacy. The club has previously organized and hosted a speaking event by Ben Shapiro. Molyneux, from Toronto, is the founder and host of the Freedomain Radio podcast and YouTube channel which has posted videos under titles like \u201cThe Death of Europe \u2013 European Migrant Crisis,\u201d \u201cMigratory Patterns of Predatory Immigrants,\u201d and \u201cThe Female Evil\u201d which espouse racist and anti-Semitic views. Southern, of Surrey, another YouTube favorite of altRightists has posted videos with titles such as \u201cAsking Feminists: Women\u2019s Rights or Islam\u201d and \u201cWhy I Hate Pride Parades.\u201d This event was originally scheduled for March 16 at the Chan Center at UBC, where the Shapiro even was held, but was cancelled following mobilized community opposition, including a petition that gathered 450 signatures in a matter of days. The free speech club claims security costs were too high for the Molyneux/Southern event prompting a move to the Hellenic Community of Vancouver (HCV, 4500 Arbutus St, Vancouver). This led to mobilizing to convince the HCV center to cancel. A demonstration was called for the 15thto oppose Molyneux and Southern. Right before midnight on March 12, ahead of the HCV general meeting of the 13th, the Free Speech Club put out a tweet saying the HCV was cancelling the event in response to the volume of community complaints. Antifascists are still vigilant. The Free Speech club have said they will go ahead with the event in a \u201csecret location.\u201d Details to follow, when available. For now it is satisfying to listen to the whine rising from the now twice disappointed \u201cfree speechers\u201d as via their social media: \u201cANNOUNCEMENT: The Hellenic Centre must cancel our booking due to physical threats of harm towards their community, and church. Domestic Terrorist groups like ANTIFA have bullied this religious community into a crippling and life threatening situation. Please do not direct your hate towards this community. We are currently booking a new venue which will remain private and for ticket holders only. \u2013 FSC Team\u201d **Share this:** Click to share on X (Opens in new window)X Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Facebook **Related** **Post navigation** **2 thoughts on \u201cAntifascist Mobilization Leads Two Venues to Cancel Molyneux and Southern Event in Vancouver (BC): \u201cFree Speechers\u201d Turn to \u201cSecret Location\u201d for March 15\u201d** Pingback:Blog: Antifascist Mobilization Leads Two Venues to Cancel Molyneux and Southern Event in Vancouver (BC): \u201cFree Speechers\u201d Turn to \u201cSecret Location\u201d for March 15 \u2013 My Blog Pingback:#Antifascist Mobilization Leads Two Venues to Cancel Molyneux and Southern Event in Vancouver (BC): \u201cFree Speechers\u201d Turn to \u201cSecret Location\u201d for March 15 | Indi\u011denaj Inteligenteco **Leave a commentCancel reply** \u0394 **Social** **Recent Posts** The Gilad Atzmon and David Rovics Antisemitism Controversy, Explained Colonialism, Green Resistance, and Fighting Eco-Fascism: An Interview With Eco-Anarchist Kevin Tucker Nationalism is No Alternative: An Interview With German Antifascists Support \u201cNo Pasaran,\u201d a New Patreon to Research and Report on Fascism and Build Resistance Community Action: Anti-Trans Speaker with Ties to Soldiers of Odin and Proud Boys Set to Speak in Vancouver on June 23 **Antifascist RSS Feed** RSS - Posts RSS - Comments **Taking on Fascism and Racism from the Ground Up.** **Follow Anti-Fascist News on Facebook** **Follow Us on Twitter** **Social Media** Facebook Twitter **Contact Us** **Follow Blog via Email** Enter your email address to follow this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.
