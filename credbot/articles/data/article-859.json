The article was rejected by the voters in a 565-142 vote. (Peter Currier/Lowell Sun) Officials in Greater Lowell towns still resisting the requirements of the MBTA Communities Law gave mixed reactions to last week\u2019s decision by Plymouth Superior Court Justice Mark Gildea against nine towns that had claimed the law to be an unfunded mandate. \u201cAt this point, we are mostly still digesting it \u2026 That decision was a fairly strong indication the court is not going to entertain claims of an unfunded mandate,\u201d Wilmington Town Manager Eric Slagle said Tuesday. On Friday,Gildea ruled againstthe argument that the law is an unfunded mandate as contended in lawsuits by the towns of Duxbury, Hanson, Holden, Marshfield, Middleton, Wenham, Weston, and Wrentham, and in a taxpayer suit brought by Hamilton residents. Gildea\u2019s ruling followed anearlier decisionby the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court that the law is constitutional, thus nullifying claims to the contrary by the town of Milton, which is now trying to negotiate an agreement with the state before its upcoming Town Meeting. The MBTA Communities Law \u2014 Chapter 40A Section 3A of Massachusetts General Laws, and often referred to simply as 3A \u2014 requires 177 communities in Eastern Massachusetts to create zones allowing multifamily housing by right. Most communities are in compliance. In this area, only Dracut, Tewksbury and Wilmington are not. The town of Wilmington had filed a similar lawsuit June 3, but Slagle said Tuesday that at the time they did not know a decision for the other towns was going to come so soon. Wilmington had requested a court hearing in its case for Wednesday, but in the wake of Gildea\u2019s decision, Slagle said the town has sought to postpone that hearing while the Select Board schedules an executive session with the town\u2019s legal counsel to consider the next steps. Wilmington hadrejectedthe proposed MBTA Communities zonseleing for the town during Town Meeting this spring, as well aslast winter. In Tewksbury, where the zoning wasrejected last yearand wasremoved from considerationin Town Meeting this year, Select Board Chair Mark Kratman said Tuesday the town had been waiting to see how the lawsuits from other towns played out. \u201cThere were so many lawsuits filed, we figured we would just be another one in the cog,\u201d said Kratman. Rather than a lawsuit of its own, Kratman said Tewksbury is waiting for a determination from State Auditor Diana DiZoglio that the law is anunfunded mandate. In February DiZoglio had sent a letter to the town of Wrentham, one of the nine towns whose lawsuit was just dismissed, making such a determination. \u201cThis decision is not deterring anybody in this town,\u201d said Kratman, referring to Gildea\u2019s ruling. Kratman said he had felt it was unlikely for the courts to side with the towns over the state, but said perhaps things could change if the whole issue somehow made it to federal court. For Dracut, the Friday ruling was the second devastating blow in a week for the town\u2019s prospects for winning any fight with the state over the MBTA Communities Law. The first occurred just a few days earlier when Town Meetingrefused to rescindthevote it took last Novemberagainst the bill. The consequences of the Town Meeting vote are likely to add to the critical budget problems the town already has. Town leaders and opponents of the law seem agreed that events last week were not good for the town. At Town Meeting, voters essentially chose to break the law by not reconsidering their vote last November. The voters followed up the vote against reconsideration with a vote not to refer the issue back to the Board of Selectmen, despite the advice of legal counsel that the state would see this as a \u201cnegative action.\u201d In a statement to The Sun regarding Dracut\u2019s actions, Board of Selectmen Chair Josh Taylor warned, \u201cVoting has consequences. The position Dracut residents took at Town Meeting is well within their rights. They spoke loud and clear that they did not want to move towards compliance with the MBTA 3A law. \u201c Taylor said, \u201cThe motion was made to refer to the selectmen for further action. On two occasions, I spoke at the podium, asking voters to support sending the article to the selectmen, stating I could create an ad hoc committee to look at all options, including filing suit for this unfunded mandate. The legislative body of the town chose to deny that request.\u201d Taylor expressed concern that the vote on the MBTA law and a vote on another article could have dire financial consequences for the town. Failing to comply with the MBTA law will disqualify the town for state grants that could total more than $3 million, according to some estimates. In Article 14, voters approved the purchase of 41 acres on Methuen Road for $750,000 for open space purposes, thus removing that land from the tax rolls in perpetuity. \u201cThat area will now never contribute to the tax base,\u201d Taylor said. With action on the MBTA law currently at a standstill, Taylor said, \u201cAs of now, I need to shift my focus to what I feel is best for the community.\u201d Without passing a Proposition 2\u00bd override for fiscal 2027, Taylor said, \u201cwe will be facing massive cuts to every department at a time when citizens need it most and wish to have stronger schools and services. We simply can\u2019t have it both ways without looking into other funding sources.\u201d Selectman Tony Archinski recalled his comments at the November Town Meeting: \u201cDracut needs to comply with the law until a court ruling determines otherwise or face possible grant funding cuts and eligibility.\u201d Those remarks, he said, \u201care as true now as they were then.\u201d Archinski continued, \u201cSimply stated, \u2018Milton\u2019 (the case brought by that town) determined that 3A was a valid law and must be complied with, and the \u2018Wenham\u2019 case (dismissed last week in Plymouth County) determined that 3A does not constitute an Unfunded Mandate, despite the Massachusetts Auditor\u2019s recent conclusion to the contrary.\u201d He added, \u201cThe \u2018No means No\u2019 group has successfully convinced a lot of people that if you squeeze your eyes closed really tight, the elephant in the room will go away. I wish that were true, but right now the score is State 2, Opponents 0.\u201d MBTA law opponent Liz Foster, who has attended many meetings of the Dracut Board of Selectmen in recent months to urge opposition, called the court decision \u201cdisappointing.\u201d She said the court \u201chas wrongly determined that zoning will not lead to construction. We are seeing this to be true in community after community that have complied with 3A. In the case of Dracut, this will have a devastating impact on our schools, infrastructure, and public safety in a very short time.\u201d Foster asked, \u201cIf they don\u2019t anticipate development, then why impose such heavy-handed tactics to impose this? I look forward to learning what the next steps will be for towns that want to challenge the unfunded mandate and the state\u2019s overreach in overriding the will of local residents in towns across the commonwealth regarding 3A.\u201d **Share this:** Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Facebook Click to share on X (Opens in new window)X **RevContent Feed** **Most Popular** Public health nurses cut from Lowell\u2019s budgetPublic health nurses cut from Lowell's budget **Public health nurses cut from Lowell\u2019s budget** **Public health nurses cut from Lowell\u2019s budget** Chelmsford man killed in late-night crash, nearly 2 decades after son\u2019s tragic deathChelmsford man killed in late-night crash, nearly 2 decades after son's tragic death **Chelmsford man killed in late-night crash, nearly 2 decades after son\u2019s tragic death** **Chelmsford man killed in late-night crash, nearly 2 decades after son\u2019s tragic death** Police surveillance leads to cocaine trafficking arrest in LowellPolice surveillance leads to cocaine trafficking arrest in Lowell **Police surveillance leads to cocaine trafficking arrest in Lowell** **Police surveillance leads to cocaine trafficking arrest in Lowell** City spends almost $1M to market, promote LowellCity spends almost $1M to market, promote Lowell **City spends almost $1M to market, promote Lowell** **City spends almost $1M to market, promote Lowell** CTI to open women\u2019s shelter in LowellCTI to open women's shelter in Lowell **CTI to open women\u2019s shelter in Lowell** **CTI to open women\u2019s shelter in Lowell** Arrest logArrest log **Arrest log** **Arrest log** Loaded gun found during traffic stop in LowellLoaded gun found during traffic stop in Lowell **Loaded gun found during traffic stop in Lowell** **Loaded gun found during traffic stop in Lowell** Kassidy Carmichael, Westford girls upset Wellesley in 11-10 thrillerKassidy Carmichael, Westford girls upset Wellesley in 11-10 thriller **Kassidy Carmichael, Westford girls upset Wellesley in 11-10 thriller** **Kassidy Carmichael, Westford girls upset Wellesley in 11-10 thriller** Matt Stuart gem lifts Chelmsford past Wellesley in 1-0 thrillerMatt Stuart gem lifts Chelmsford past Wellesley in 1-0 thriller **Matt Stuart gem lifts Chelmsford past Wellesley in 1-0 thriller** **Matt Stuart gem lifts Chelmsford past Wellesley in 1-0 thriller** \u2018A really great group of kids\u2019: Tyngsboro High School\u2019s Class of 2025 graduates'A really great group of kids': Tyngsboro High School's Class of 2025 graduates **\u2018A really great group of kids\u2019: Tyngsboro High School\u2019s Class of 2025 graduates** **\u2018A really great group of kids\u2019: Tyngsboro High School\u2019s Class of 2025 graduates** **More in Local News** SUBSCRIBER ONLYMassachusetts girls flag football soars to new heights **SUBSCRIBER ONLY** **Massachusetts girls flag football soars to new heights** **SUBSCRIBER ONLY** **Massachusetts girls flag football soars to new heights** Merrimack Valley Conference honors top boys, girls tennis players **Merrimack Valley Conference honors top boys, girls tennis players** **Merrimack Valley Conference honors top boys, girls tennis players** Chelmsford man killed in late-night crash, nearly 2 decades after son\u2019s tragic death **Chelmsford man killed in late-night crash, nearly 2 decades after son\u2019s tragic death** **Chelmsford man killed in late-night crash, nearly 2 decades after son\u2019s tragic death** SUBSCRIBER ONLYRourke Bridge site investigation work to begin next week **SUBSCRIBER ONLY** **Rourke Bridge site investigation work to begin next week** **SUBSCRIBER ONLY** **Rourke Bridge site investigation work to begin next week** 2025 June 10 Subscribee-EditionSign Up For NewslettersMobile Apps e-Edition Sign Up For Newsletters Mobile Apps e-Edition Sign Up For Newsletters Mobile Apps Contact UsContestsPurchase PhotosWork With UsPrivacy PolicyAccessibilitySitemap Contests Purchase Photos Work With Us Privacy Policy Accessibility Sitemap Contests Purchase Photos Work With Us Privacy Policy Accessibility Sitemap ClassifiedsToday\u2019s Print AdsPublic NoticesLocal Guide Today\u2019s Print Ads Public Notices Local Guide Today\u2019s Print Ads Public Notices Local Guide MNG Network AdvertisingSpecial SectionsAdtaxi SolutionsHomesJobs Special Sections Adtaxi Solutions Homes Jobs Special Sections Adtaxi Solutions Homes Jobs Subscribe Now Terms of Use Cookie Policy Cookie Preferences California Notice at Collection Notice of Financial Incentive Do Not Sell/Share My Personal Informatio Arbitration MediaNews Group Powered by WordPress.com VIP Copyright \u00a9 2025 MediaNews Group"}
