To help propel the Cherries into the top half of the table and potential European contention. The 25-year-old scored in Bournemouth\u2019s 3-0 win at Old Trafford in December and will line up against the Red Devils once more before the season concludes. United\u2019s interest in Semenyo has been established in recent weeks. Rivalling Arsenal and Liverpool both of whom are thought to have been tracking the Ghana international for a while. The Athletic\u2019s David Ornstein made clear Amorim\u2019s particular liking of Semenyo during an appearance on American broadcasterNBC Sports. But, as had already been established, Bournemouth won\u2019t let Semenyo go cheap. \u201cThey would be looking to sell him for a fee in excess of what they got for Dominic Solanke which was \u00a365m. There\u2019s no release clause, they would want a club record,\u201d Ornstein said. Semenyo has played in each of English football\u2019s top four divisions. As well as non-league, starting out at Bristol City and proving himself during lower-level loans. It was his form for the Robins in the Championship that eventually prompted Bournemouth to pay \u00a310m in January 2023. United aren\u2019t just targeting a striker to make good on Amorim\u2019s ambition of challenging for the Premier League title as soon as possible. Semenyo could be a good fit for one of the split \u2018number ten\u2019 roles that are a feature of the coach\u2019s 3-4-2-1 system. With Wolves forward Matheus Cunha also identified for a similar purpose. Cunha is slightly older and more experienced. But comes with a \u00a362.5m release clause in his contract and has openly declared his readiness for a bigger move. **Archives** May 2025 March 2025 January 2025 December 2024 September 2024 June 2024 April 2024 February 2024 November 2023 August 2023 May 2023 July 2022 **Categories** Article Beauty & Health Beauty and Health & Lifestyle Sport and Game Sportnews and Football **503** **Service Unavailable** The server is temporarily busy, try again later!"}
