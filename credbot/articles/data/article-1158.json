The federal government last month restarted collections on defaulted loans. State student loan ombudspersons such as Damian have become some of the only sources of contact for worried borrowers lost in a tangle of conflicting information at the federal level about their loan status and repayment options. The U.S. Department of Education began collecting on defaulted student loans in May for the first time since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. Federal student loans issued by the U.S. Department of Education come withfixed rates, set repayment plans and borrower protections. Private servicers handle billing, repayment-plan enrollments and defaults. More than 5 million borrowers are in delinquency, and nearly 10 million \u2014 about 25% of the federal student loan portfolio \u2014 are at risk of default within months, according to data from the U.S. Department of Education. States can\u2019t cancel that debt, but they do register and oversee servicers operating in their states, run ombuds offices, tweak tax rules and offer outreach or limited grants \u2014 actions aimed at reducing defaults and the economic fallout. When borrowers default, states will likely feel the economic impact. They might lose tax revenue as home buying stalls. They could end up paying more for Medicaid and social services if borrowers need to rely on them. And students with loan debt may be reluctant to go into lower-paying public-sector work, leading to staffing shortages at state agencies. A borrower is considered delinquent after missing a payment to the servicing companies that handle billing, repayment plan enrollments, and defaults. Damian\u2019s office, established under California\u2019s Student Borrower Bill of Rights, began as a narrow statutory role but now serves as a hub for outreach, \u201cStudent Loan 101\u201d workshops and escalated complaints to federal agencies. Roughly16 statesplus the District of Columbia have followed suit, creating ombuds offices to guide borrowers through confusing paperwork and misinformation. Damian believes these ombuds offices should be in every state, as borrowers across the country will likely have similar questions and little help at the federal level. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have an ombudsperson or even just a person at the state level who can educate borrowers, that will make a difference,\u201d Damian told Stateline. \u201cThese borrowers are trying to pay, but the system is broken. No other financial product works this way.\u201d Student loans became a key issue during last year\u2019s election race, with President Joe Biden blocked by the U.S. Supreme Court in his effort to offer relief to 40 million Americans. In its waning days, his administration did forgive loans for some 150,000 borrowers under previous programs. But President Donald Trump opposes most loan forgiveness programs, and in May, the U.S. Education Department issued a\u201cDear Colleague\u201d letter to higher education institutions, reminding them of their legal obligations to help former students understand repayment responsibilities and access support. **Related Articles** Disney and Universal sue AI firm Midjourney for copyright infringement Google offers buyouts to more workers amid AI-driven tech upheaval and antitrust uncertainty Inflation barely rose last month as cheaper gas and cars offset some costlier imports Trump says US gets rare earth minerals from China and tariffs on Chinese goods will total 55% US stocks drift near their record following an encouraging inflation update Some conservative economistssaythat federal loan forgiveness and financial aid hurt all students, offering colleges an incentive to raise tuition or lower their own institutional aid. Winston Berkman-Breen, the legal director at the Student Borrower Protection Center, a nonprofit aimed at protecting borrowers and improving the repayment system, said that more than 2 million borrowers are stuck in a backlog ofunprocessed applicationsforincome-driven repayment, orIDR, plans\u2014 calculated pay structures meant to keep payments affordable based on a borrower\u2019s income. Other borrowers have called federal agencies for help only to find that U.S. Education Department staff,including servicer-oversight teams, have been laid off as the Trump administration works toward dismantling the department entirely. \u201cThere was an expectation to repay,\u201d Berkman-Breen said. \u201cBut there was also an expectation that people would have access to affordable plans. That promise has broken down.\u201d States now have three primary tools to address student loan debt, Berkman-Breen said: enforcement actions to protect consumers, such as the39-state lawsuitagainst servicer Navient; legal oversight by suing to uphold or challenge federal policy; and direct outreach to help public servants access Public Service Loan Forgiveness and similar programs. Nineteen states now require registration for companies that service student loans, he said. And more than a dozen states align with federal policy to exempt forgiven loan balances from state income taxes. Connecticut state Rep. Eleni Kavros DeGraw, a Democrat, calls student debt \u201ca drag on the economy,\u201d and said states can\u2019t afford to wait for Congress \u2014 mired in partisan gridlock over student loan forgiveness \u2014 to find common ground. \u201c(Student debt) is stopping people from buying homes, starting families and fully participating in the economy,\u201d she told Stateline. \u201cThat hurts us as a state, as a city, and we can\u2019t wait for Washington to figure it out.\u201d Last year, Connecticut created a bipartisanreimbursement programthat provides up to $20,000 for graduates of local colleges who make payments and complete community service. The state has distributed more than $2 million so far. Kavros DeGraw hopes the program can serve as a model, and has already talked with lawmakers in other states on possibly developing their own versions of it. \u201cThese were people who were already paying,\u201d Kavros DeGraw said. \u201cIt just made sense. I think it\u2019s something that other states could explore this session, and it would provide an immense deal of relief.\u201d Lawmakers in other states also have considered student loan legislation. This year, New Jersey introduced bills toregister education lendersand cap interest rates. Lawmakers inNew Mexico,New YorkandNorth Carolinahave proposed Borrower Bill of Rights legislation. Arizona has a registration bill for private servicers. None of these measures has advanced far. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, more than 20 states have enacted laws expanding loan forgiveness, repayment programs and servicer oversight in recent years. Several states are also investing directly in workforce-aligned loan forgiveness: Georgia expanded its service-cancelable loanprogramto cover dental students working in rural areas. Idaho created a loan repaymentincentivefor rural nurses. Kentucky now offers $5,000stipendsto attract new teachers. Maryland authorized Anne Arundel County to launch a localforgivenessprogram for public school educators. Student loan stress is notevenly distributed. Seven states, all with Republican\u2010controlled legislatures, report delinquency rates above 30% among borrowers required to make payments. Mississippi leads the nation with a conditional delinquency rate of nearly 45% \u2014 meaning borrowers who should be making payments are late. That\u2019s just ahead of Alabama, West Virginia, Kentucky, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Louisiana, all of which have rates above 31%, according to recent data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. By contrast, Illinois, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Vermont and New Hampshire maintain delinquency rates below 15%. Experts say this chasm reflects deeper systemic differences, such as lower median incomes in higher delinquency states, along with weaker consumer protections and a higher share of students attending for-profit institutions or leaving college without a degree. States also have promoted the federal Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, established in 2007, that offers help to public service professionals. New Mexico has an outreach campaign that includesprospective teachersand health care workers. Maine has providedguidanceto public defenders on how they can take advantage of the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program and touts a related state tax credit on a marketingsiteto lure new residents. \u201cStates can regulate and enforce, but they can\u2019t fix the structural problems in how repayment is administered,\u201d said Michele Zampini, senior director of college affordability at The Institute for College Access & Success, a research organization that advocates for students. \u201cThey\u2019re helping around the edges, but the core system is still broken.\u201d A Novemberreportfrom the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau found at least 3.9 million borrowers received misleading or inaccurate bills from servicing companies. \u201cThe repayment system is not in a good place to provide the services and repayment options borrowers are legally entitled to,\u201d Zampini said. The Student Loan Borrower Survey, conducted between October 2023 and January 2024, found that 61% of borrowers who received debt relief made a beneficial life change earlier than they otherwise could have. Yet borrower awareness remains dangerously low: Nearly 42% of federal borrowers have only been on the standard repayment plan, and 31% of those didn\u2019t know other options, such as an income-based plan, existed. In California, a major part of Damian\u2019s job in the past few months has been to help borrowers access existing forgiveness programs. Meanwhile, new federal policy proposals could reshape repayment entirely. The Trump-backedOne Big Beautiful Bill Actwould consolidate existing IDR plans into a single tiered structure, with lower-income borrowers paying flat monthly rates and higher earners contributing 8% of their income. The bill also proposes extending standard repayment terms to 30 years \u2014 raising concerns it could delay forgiveness and inflate total interest costs. The bill passed the U.S. House and is pending in the Senate. Andrew Gillen, a Cato Institute research fellow who recently testified before Congress, argues that any meaningful fix must address the incentives driving rising tuition \u2014 namely, federal aid being tied directly to college sticker prices. \u201cThe link between rising tuition and increasing aid is what drives the Bennett Hypothesis, where federal student aid, in the form of loans, can lead to higher tuition costs at colleges and universities,\u201d Gillen said in an interview. \u201cIf we instead use the median cost of attendance to calculate aid eligibility, we remove colleges\u2019 incentive to hike prices just to capture more aid.\u201d Even without agreement on blanket forgiveness, experts agree on smaller bipartisan steps: streamlined repayment, stronger servicer oversight and targeted help for borrowers with the greatest need. \u201cWe don\u2019t want people defaulting. We don\u2019t want payments that are too high for people just out of school. That should be the bipartisan starting point,\u201d Zampini said. \u00a92025 States Newsroom. Visit at stateline.org.
