Among the most concerning groups identified in his research is Unity of Fields (UoF), a Palestinian group that explicitly promotes militant protest tactics and has engaged in direct confrontations with U.S. police. Mauro said the group\u2019s stated mission is to \u201cdisrupt and dismantle Zionism and U.S. imperialism through direct militant actions.\u201d The group frequently deploys slogans such as \u201cNo cops, no KKK, no Fascist USA!\u201d and refers to the NYPD as \u201cIOF-trained pigs,\u201d a reference to the Israel Defense Forces. In a recent paper titled Marching Towards Violence, Mauro reports that anarchist groups are increasingly aiming to operate as an \u201canti-police wannabe insurgency.\u201d He said that his research tracked 150 of the most active \u201cpro-Palestinian\u201d groups on social media in the 15 months before and after the October 7 Hamas-led terror attack in Israel. The findings showed a 186% increase in anti-American rhetoric and a more than 3,000% rise in posts calling for violence on U.S. soil. Mauro also warned of an unlikely alliance between far-left and far-right elements seeking to exploit civil unrest in the U.S. \u201cThey believe that once the system collapses, their ideology will rise to the top,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s an accelerationist strategy.\u201d Despite what he describes as a current moment of unity among radical groups, Mauro predicts internal fractures ahead. He believes Indian Hindus may become the next target of the radical coalition due to tensions between India and Pakistan. \u201cOnce these groups pivot to attacking Hindus, it will become clear they were never about Palestine,\u201d Mauro said. \u201cThey jump from cause to cause to create chaos and insurgency in America.\u201d Mauro also emphasized the threat posed by far-right antisemitism, pointing to conspiracy theories spread by figures such as Tucker Carlson and controversial statements from conservative commentator Candace Owens. \u201cThe far-left\u2019s antisemitism is dangerous, but the far-right can\u2019t be ignored,\u201d Mauro said. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing toxic ideologies from both ends feeding into the same destructive current.\u201d Mauro\u2019s research, including publications such as When Charities Betray America: How \u201cPro-Palestinian\u201d Protest Groups Promote Anti-Americanism and Pro-Hamas Extremism Taking Root in America, forms part of an expanding body of work examining domestic extremism and its links to global terror movements. **Follow VINnews for Breaking News Updates** **Connect with VINnews** \u0394 \u0394 This man speaks powerful truths!
