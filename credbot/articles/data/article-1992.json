The bit of stage design reflected Trump\u2019s obsession with appearances and popularity, but it was highly unusual for the military, which has long sought to portray itself as indifferent to partisan politics. Military.com reviewed written orders it said were sent out in preparation for the event. One order reportedly read, \u201cNo fat soldiers.\u201d The troops were reportedly told they could object to being placed in the stands behind Trump if their personal values were in conflict with his politics. Trump\u2019s speech at Fort Bragg sounded no different from a campaign rally, featuring insults for political foes like Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass and California Gov. Gavin Newsom, bothDemocrats. The troops\u2019 reactions were similarly striking. They cheered some of the president\u2019s most inflammatory remarks, such as when he characterized immigration as an \u201cinvasion.\u201d Elsewhere at Fort Bragg, Military.com reported that Trump campaign merchandise was for sale. One item, a fake credit card, reportedly read, \u201cWhite Privilege Card: Trumps Everything.\u201d An unnamed commander told Military.com the event was \u201cshameful.\u201d \u201cThis has been a bad week for the Army for anyone who cares about us being a neutral institution,\u201d the commander said. The Army is nearing the 250th anniversary of its founding, which will culminate with a massive military parade on Saturday, June 14 \u2014 coincidentally, Trump\u2019s 79th birthday. The Department of Defense specifically prohibits active-duty soldiers from engaging in partisan political activity. A \u201cquick guide\u201d on the rules for service members dated last year states that \u201call members of the Armed Forces should always avoid actions that could reasonably be perceived as implying DoD sponsorship, approval or endorsement of partisan political activity.\u201d It does not appear, however, that the soldiers will face any repercussions for engaging in Trump\u2019s speech this week.
