She has taught over a dozen different courses, including Intro to Public History; Oral History; Museums and Archives Management Basics; NJ History; and the Vietnam War. In August of 2023, she became curator of the University\u2019s Bruce Springsteen Archives & Center for American Music, after having worked with the Center for many years in her faculty role (to include curating the Center\u2019s first traveling exhibit, Springsteen: His Hometown, with the Monmouth County Historical Association in 2019). Her most recent publications include Fort Monmouth: The US Army\u2019s House of Magic (2024) and The Battlin\u2019 Bastards of Bravo: Bravo Company, 1/506th, 101st Airborne, in Vietnam and Beyond (2025). As someone who\u2019s seen what happens when the truth is distorted, I know how unfair it feels when those who\u2019ve sacrificed the most lose their voice.
