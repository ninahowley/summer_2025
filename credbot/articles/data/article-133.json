Instead, we\u2019re entering an age of abundance powered by technologies that need no external input to continue growing. Seba and Arbib consider how individuals and businesses alike can adapt \u2014 and thrive \u2014 in this unfolding future. I recently sat down with futurists Tony Seba and James Arbib, co-founders of the think tankRethinkX, to discuss their latest bookStellar. Known for their bold predictions about the disruption of industries like energy, food, and transportation, Seba and Arbib argue that humanity is undergoing a civilizational phase change. The core premise? We\u2019re leaving behind the old system of \u201cextraction\u201d \u2014 reliance on land, labor, and capital \u2014 and entering a new world powered by technologies that need no external input to continue growing. This is a \u201cstellar\u201dworld, and it\u2019s one of abundance. In this wide-ranging conversation, we explore howStellarcame to be, what makes the current transformation different from anything before, and how individuals and businesses alike can adapt \u2014 and thrive \u2014 in this unfolding future. Eric Markowitz:Let\u2019s go back to the beginning. How did this collaboration start? James Arbib:Well, before we met, Tony had already writtenClean Disruption of Energy and Transportation, and developed this whole framework around technological change. I came at this from an environmental background \u2014 I was investing in cleantech and trying to shift capital away from fossil fuels. One of the projects I was involved in led me to a meeting with the U.S. military, focused on the national security implications of transitioning to clean energy. They were holding a scenario planning day with the Military Advisory Board, and all these big names were there \u2014 BP, Exxon, the State Department \u2014 and they all had the same straight-line forecasts out to 2050. Maybe 30% adoption of solar and EVs by then. Tony Seba:And when it was my turn to speak at that event, I just said: \u201cThat\u2019s not how disruptions happen. They\u2019re not slow or linear \u2014 they\u2019re nonlinear, exponential, and follow an S-curve. If you plan based on linear forecasts, you\u2019re going to make catastrophic errors.\u201d James Arbib:And I remember standing up and saying, \u201cI agree with Tony.\u201d We ended up getting coffee after the event, and what we discovered was that we were both asking the same core questions. Eric Markowitz:What were those questions? James Arbib:One was: What\u2019s really at the root of climate change, inequality, and the major social problems we face? Because so much of the environmental discourse felt like it was treating symptoms, not causes. Carbon taxes, behavior change, subsidies \u2014 they\u2019re Band-Aids. We were trying to get to the source. Tony Seba:And my version of that question was: How does change actually happen? Not just small, incremental change, but massive systemic transformation? And once it starts, what are the consequences? James Arbib:That led to the founding of RethinkX. We committed to offering free, public research that modeled how technological disruptions really unfold. We analyzed over 1,500 historical disruptions to understand what makes them go from fringe to dominant \u2014 and what happens next. Tony Seba:The idea was simple: if the U.S. military \u2014 the world\u2019s largest organization \u2014 has a flawed view of the future, based on outdated models, then who can plan well? We wanted to create tools for better foresight. We argued the most disruptive tech wasn\u2019t lab-grown meat or regenerative farming, but something most people hadn\u2019t heard of: precision fermentation. Eric Markowitz:And that work led to your first book,Rethinking Humanity, right? James Arbib:Yes, though even before that we published sector-specific reports \u2014 on transportation, food, energy. In 2017, we said the disruption of transport would be autonomous, electric, and on-demand. Not a cleaner version of the gas car \u2014 but a complete transformation. Tony Seba:The same was true in food. We argued the most disruptive tech wasn\u2019t lab-grown meat or regenerative farming, but something most people hadn\u2019t heard of: precision fermentation. Making proteins with microbes on steep cost curves. That\u2019s the kind of insight that came from asking: What enables new systems to flourish? Eric Markowitz:So how didStellarbuild on that? Tony Seba:WithRethinking Humanity, we realized we were still thinking in silos \u2014 energy, food, transport. But the bigger question was: What happens when all these systems change at once? We saw that these transformations were systemic, interlinked, and reinforcing. James Arbib:And it turns out, yes, there is historical precedent. Sumer, Egypt, Rome, the Industrial Revolution \u2014 whenever you have simultaneous, transformative changes in energy, food, materials, and information, society itself undergoes a phase change. But this time is different. Tony Seba:Because this time, we\u2019re not just replacing old inputs with slightly better ones. We\u2019re leaving the entire logic of extraction behind. These new technologies \u2014 solar, AI, robotics, fermentation \u2014 theyembodyland, labor, and capital. Once built, they keep producing with almost no additional input. That\u2019s never happened before. These new technologies \u2014 solar, AI, robotics, fermentation \u2014embodyland, labor, and capital. Once built, they keep producing with almost no additional input. That\u2019s never happened before. Eric Markowitz:And that\u2019s what you call the shift from \u201cextraction flow\u201d to a \u201cstellar society.\u201d James Arbib:Exactly. Extraction societies are built around managing inputs \u2014 land, labor, capital. That creates competition, hierarchy, and inevitably, exploitation. It\u2019s why slavery, inequality, and environmental degradation have been constants in civilization. They were features, not bugs. Tony Seba:But in a stellar system, you don\u2019t need continual input. The system is self-sustaining. The only input is sunlight. That breaks the growth imperative and flips the entire economic equation. Eric Markowitz:That\u2019s a pretty radical statement. How do you see it playing out practically? James Arbib:Let\u2019s take energy. Today, your business model is shaped by energy costs \u2014 how much you pay per unit, how much you waste. But if you suddenly have a superabundant energy system at zero marginal cost, everything changes. Entire industries will be reshaped. And new ones will emerge that we can\u2019t yet imagine. Tony Seba:We\u2019re not building the butterfly. We\u2019re sticking wings on the caterpillar. We\u2019re shoehorning solar and wind into centralized systems built for fossil fuels, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re hitting regulatory and economic bottlenecks. But a truestellarsystem \u2014 built from the ground up \u2014 unlocks radically different properties. James Arbib:And it\u2019s not just technology. It\u2019s governance, thought, institutions. In extraction, centralized hierarchies made sense. In a stellar world \u2014 made of distributed, self-sufficient nodes \u2014 they don\u2019t. Everything from ownership to organizational design will be reimagined. Eric Markowitz:What about the human side? How do individuals adapt to this kind of systemic upheaval? James Arbib:That\u2019s the heart of it. You have to developantifragility\u2014 the ability to lean into change and grow stronger. Because this is going to be the most profound shift in 10,000 years of civilization. And it\u2019s not just external. It\u2019s internal, too. Tony Seba:Extraction shaped our minds. We evolved to think linearly, mechanistically, because that\u2019s what extraction rewarded. But now, holistic, systems thinking becomes valuable. Even our social sciences \u2014 economics, psychology, sociology \u2014 they were developed for humansin extraction. That\u2019s why they so often fail us now. James Arbib:And there are signs of change. Consciousness movements, biohacking, decentralized communities \u2014 they\u2019re all pieces of this transition. But we still lack a unifying vision that ties them together. You have to developantifragility\u2014 the ability to lean into change and grow stronger. Because this is going to be the most profound shift in 10,000 years of civilization. Eric Markowitz:Speaking of resistance \u2014 how do you think about the entrenched interests that want to maintain the current system? Tony Seba:We\u2019re already in a dual economy. Part of the world is still playing by extraction rules. The other part \u2014 solar, AI, robotics \u2014 is moving fast. And the extractive side is collapsing under its own entropy. We don\u2019t need everyone to agree. Just someone, somewhere, to make it work. James Arbib:And once that happens, others will follow. It\u2019s a race to the top. Whoever gets there first \u2014 whether it\u2019s a city, company, or country \u2014 will unlock outsized value and leapfrog the rest.Incumbents will resist, but they\u2019ll be left behind. Eric Markowitz:What keeps you optimistic? Tony Seba:Stellar is a system of radiance. It gives back. It\u2019s restorative. Extraction is high-entropy and self-destructive. Stellar is negative-entropy and regenerative. That\u2019s not just better economics. That\u2019s a better civilization. James Arbib:And I see it happening in pockets already. From spiritual exploration to technological experimentation, people are reaching beyond the extractive mindset. The seeds are there. We just need to nurture them. Eric Markowitz:I love that. And I\u2019ll just say, from my end \u2014 this really connects with my own work. I\u2019m writing a book calledOutlast, about long-term thinking and resilient systems. I\u2019ve been interviewing companies that have lasted for centuries. What they all have in common is a non-extractive relationship with their communities. It\u2019s mutual. It\u2019s regenerative. It\u2019s, well \u2014 stellar. Tony Seba:Amazing. Keep us posted. Stellaris availablehere.
