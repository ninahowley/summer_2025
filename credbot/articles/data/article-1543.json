One minute, we\u2019re watching the children of our belovedReal Housewivesdance in the background of their mom\u2019s title card or have a mental breakdown because they lost a game of tug-of-war at field day, but before you know it, they\u2019re leading their own reality show. That\u2019s the loose premise ofNext Gen NYC\u2014 a show following a group of rich, well-connected twenty-somethings navigating Manhattan with their friends \u2026 after meeting each other at BravoCon. The vibe is the reboot ofGossip GirlmeetsThe City, and the whole time, it feels like Kelly Cutrone is going to show up at any minute to yell at these kids. The first of those kids that we meet, oddly, is Ariana Biermann \u2014 NOTTate McRae, as your eyeballs might lead you to believe (one sings about a sports car, and the othercrashesthem). Ariana is, of course, the daughter of Kim Zolciak, a former cast memberofThe Real Housewives of Atlanta, and appears to be a late addition to the show, as all of her scenes in the premiere are separate from the rest of the group. She\u2019s off on her own the whole episode apartment hunting, which she does by wandering the streets, having old Italian women point out new vacancies to her, and looking up random addresses on Zillow. She\u2019s arriving in the city for a fresh start with her boyfriend Hudson in tow, and it doesn\u2019t take long for money to become an issue. And not just because of expensive rent. We find out that Kim not only took all the money Ariana had earned as a minor, but she still regularly relies on her for cash. Does that make Ariana the new Big Poppa? For the sake of her wigs, Kim better hope this new show is a hit. Despite meeting Ariana first, the real anchor of the series is world-renowned tracksuit designer Brooks Marks, who\u2019s in the throes of a photoshoot with his mother,RHOSLC\u2019s Meredith Marks. He and his iconically monotone voice are at the center of this show\u2019s Venn diagram, bringing together his fellow Bravo offspring with his other city friends \u2014 like Charlie Zakkour and Ava Dash, who we meet at the photoshoot. Ava is the model daughter of Damon Dash and Rachel Roy (who infamously posted \u201cgood hair don\u2019t care\u201d afterrumors emergedthat she was the \u201cBecky\u201d referenced by Beyonc\u00e9 onLemonade), while Charlie uses his dad\u2019s money to be a crypto-trader. As if that job title wasn\u2019t dark enough, you might have seen him in thenewsrecently for being present at the Soho townhouse for the arrest made in a cryptocurrency torture and kidnapping scheme. Described by Brooks as Scott Disick in Barry Manilow\u2019s body, Charlie is clearly meant to be the show\u2019s resident douchey fuck boy. Much like his womanizing Bravo predecessor, Jax Taylor, he even alleges a relationship with Lindsay Lohan. But unlike the make-believe stocks he wastes his dad\u2019s money on, he never sells that persona. Sure, he sits in chairs like a tool, but he has the soft face of someone who cries a lot, so he\u2019s not quite as threatening as the show wants him to be. Nonetheless, his asking out Brooks\u2019s sister Chloe is the perfect sprinkling of drama to kick this show off. It\u2019s through Charlie that we also meet the show\u2019s true breakout star \u2014 Georgia McCann. She\u2019s a brand/events strategist who always has a glass of red wine in her unwashed hands and who, without explanation, combs her hair with a fork like she\u2019s Ariel inThe Little Mermaid. I\u2019m obsessed with this girl. Unlike the majority of the cast, she says she grew up \u201cbetween poor and middle class\u201d and is fueled by anxiety. Time and time again, she brings upWhen Harry Met Sally, a reference that painfully goes over the heads of every single person she mentions it to. Fittingly, one of her calling cards is a nightclub party she threw at Katz\u2019s that Diplo DJed, and she was also the person behind Anna Delvey\u2019s \u201cClub House Arrest\u201d party. Could an Anna Delvey cameo be imminent? In the meanwhile, Brooks meets up with Riley Burruss (daughter ofRHOA\u2019s Kandi Burruss and his fellow NYU classmate) to shop for their friend Emira\u2019s fashion show, where he fills her in on his sister\u2019s date with Charlie. As we saw, the date itself was fairly innocuous and kicked off (as I imagine all heterosexual dates do) with him showing her a photo of his skateboarding injury. But the thing bothering Brooks isn\u2019t just the date; it was the text he got from Charlie saying that he should meet up with them afterward unless Chloe is already back at his apartment by then. To quote Brooks\u2019s reply, \u201cEWWW.\u201d Given that this is a reality show, Brooks naturally has to confront Charlie about this. The problem is that Brooks hates confrontation \u2014 a trait that makes him an unconventional choice for reality television. That\u2019s like finding out your doctor gets queasy around blood. Nonetheless, I\u2019m fascinated to see him try to adjust to this as the season plays out. It helps that he\u2019s also being guided through it by Riley and Gia Guidice (daughter ofRHONJ\u2019s Teresa Guidice), who have been in this world much longer than Brooks has. Gia is commuting into the city from Jersey to do this show, representing the community of people who incorrectly think living in New Jersey is basically the same as living in the city. But Bravo should keep paying for her E-ZPass, because she wastes no time egging on Brooks to bring up his issue with Charlie at the bar they all convene at after Emira\u2019s fashion show. But before that, something even crazier happens. When Ava arrives and shows off her Manolo Blahniks, our diva Georgia \u2014 who I have no choice but to believe Cecily Strong\u2019sGirl You Wish You Hadn\u2019t Started a Conversation With at a Partywas based on \u2014 reaches out and caresses the bottom of the shoe, distressing the entire room. But Georgia\u2019s not fazed; she\u2019s too busy immediately touching her eyes with the same hand. Brooks has no choice but to confront Charlie before they all succumb to pink eye. With Gia and Riley acting as his midwives, gently guiding his reality television birth, he points out that the text was completely out of pocket. Charlie tries to deny that he said that, but the texts don\u2019t lie, so after bristling at Gia\u2019s involvement, he offers a non-apology apology that, at best, acknowledges that the text was sent. It\u2019s ultimately a pretty tame, perhaps architected, kernel of drama to give everybody their sea legs and get this ball rolling, but after it\u2019s resolved, we get something truly incredible. Georgia tags along when Riley and Gia go to the bathroom, and the pair of them \u2014 already spooked by her touching the bottom of that shoe \u2014 are disgusted to learn that Georgia openly doesn\u2019t wash her hands. Not only that, she comes out as being proudly pro-germ. \u201cI was like the kid in New York City eating candy off the sidewalk,\u201d she says, crediting this as to why she never gets sick. The entire gathering is horrified. Riley won\u2019t even let her hug her goodbye with her dirty hands. \u201cWhat happened to my body, my choice?\u201d Georgia wonders. Let me make this totally clear \u2014 I think that\u2019s completely disgusting \u2026 but hilarious. Georgia, one of the few cast members on this show without famous and/or reality TV star parents, is the one making the best television right out of the gate. If her unabashed absurdity is any indication of where this show will take us, I\u2019m totally on board. And I think she should be mayor. **VULTURE NEWSLETTER** By submitting your email, you agree to ourTermsandPrivacy Noticeand to receive email correspondence from us. **Tags:** tv tv recaps overnights recaps next gen nyc bravo reality tv premiere More Things you buy through our links may earnVox Mediaa commission. **Most Viewed Stories** Cinematrix No. 442: The June Criterion Edition Why Does SmartLess Mobile Feel So Grim?
