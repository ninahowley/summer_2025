Former President Joe Biden, as well as his Democratic predecessor Barack Obama, pledged to \u201cfollow the science\u201d when it came to climate policies. Since President Donald Trump assumed office \u2014 a man accused of waging a \u201cwar on science\u201d \u2014 revelations have shown that, when it came to previous administrations, sometimes science was either shaped to serve preferred policies or dismissed when it didn\u2019t support them. Energy SecretaryChris Wright confirmed in Marchthat the Biden-Harris administration had completed a study on liquefied natural gas exports prior to enacting a pause on export permits, the stated intention of which was to complete such a study. Wright stated that the Biden-Harris administration didn\u2019t like what the study said, so they set out to produce one that would support the climate policies they wanted. Emails exchanged at the Obama-era EPAin 2009 showed that the so-called endangerment finding, which has been the basis for much of the EPA\u2019s regulation of carbon dioxide emissions ever since, was a foregone conclusion even before the agency announced the finding. It appears that the Biden-Harris administration hid comments that would have undermined itsClean Power Plan 2.0 rule(CPP2), which theTrump administration is currently reviewing. The EPA had sought comments from the Department of Energy\u2019s National Energy Technology Lab (NETL) on the efficacy of carbon capture technology prior to proposing the rule. These comments, which were somehow scrubbed from the administrative record, disputed a key claim the rule is based on. Those missing comments, a legal expert says, could provide a basis for the rule\u2019s repeal. Casting significant doubt The CPP2 requires all coal plants to install carbon capture technology by 2039, which captures and stores emissions in underground geological formations. It also requires new natural gas-fired power plants to install the technology, with requirements starting in 2032.Experts warned the rules would drive up electricity costsand destabilize the grid by disincentivizing reliable power from coal and natural gas in favor of intermittent wind and solar power. The Clean Air Act authorizes the EPA to develop new emissions standards, but those standards must be achievable at a reasonable cost. The technology required for compliance must also beadequately demonstrated. Documents obtained byJust the Newsshow that the EPA formally sought comments from NETL in March 2023 on its soon-to-be proposed rule, which was put out forpublic comment the following May. In December, Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., chair of the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability, wrote to then-EPA Administrator Micheal Regan to ask for the names of people in the Biden administration who had provided comments to the EPA on an internal draft of the CPP2. These comments, Comer\u2019s letter explains, \u201ccast significant doubt\u201d over whether the proposed CPP2 is viable. Letter-to-EPA-Unmasking-Comments.pdf The proposed rule allowed for two technologies \u2014 hydrogen and carbon capture and underground storage (CCUS) \u2014 to meet the emissions standards on fossil fuel-burning power plants. Comer\u2019s letter quotes two unnamed authors expressing that neither technology was viable. Hydrogen was removed from the rule when it wasfinalized in April 2024. Carbon capture technology, however, was part of the final rule, even though the comments from one unnamed NETL author stated that \u201cCCUS remains prohibitively expensive even after use of funds or tax credits made available through the Inflation Reduction Act.\u201d Underperforming failure The comments disputing the adequacy of CCUS went further than those in Comer\u2019s letter.Government Oversight and Accountability(GAO), a watchdog group, filed a FOIA request in April seeking comments that NETL engineers had submitted via the NETL network in response to the March 2023 request by the EPA for the administrative record of what would later become the CPP2 proposed rule. The EPA based its determination that CCUS was \u201cadequately demonstrated\u201d on the performance of theBoundary Dam Unit #3(BD3), which is a Canadian coal-fired power plant fitted with carbon capture technology. An April 2024 report by theInstitute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysiscalled the project an \u201cunder-performing failure.\u201d Despite $1 billion CAD spent on the project, it was, as of April 2024, capturing far less than the 90% originally promised. Its capture rate through the end of 2023 was just 57%, which was 63% of the 90% promised, the report found. Comments from NETL engineers, according to the GAO\u2019s records request, state that \u201cthe ongoing operating performance of the same BD3 demonstration project is being, once again, misconstrued as having provided sufficient justification for claiming satisfactory performance to allow the technology to be considered \u2018adequately demonstrated.\u2019\u201d Another comment states that BD3 only approached the 90% promised target for two months over a period of 8 years and three months. Another comment states that after 8 years and three months \u201cof demonstration, such failure to meet negligible standards for emissions limitations, over a full-year period ending less than one year ago, argues strongly for not considering BD3 as a credible basis for Best System of Emissions Reduction and \u2018adequate demonstration\u2019 of the related technology.\u201d \u201cThese comments were sanitized at some point in this process and were not included in NETL\u2019s and/or DoE\u2019s comments to EPA, which made their way into the administrative record,\u201d according to the GAO\u2019s record request. 4.10.25 GAO NETL request for March 2023 CPP comments.pdf Other indications of doubt Chris Horner, an environment and energy policy attorney, toldJust the Newsthat Comer\u2019s letter, which was directed at the EPA, suggests where the comments might have been scrubbed. \u201cFrom information revealed by the House Oversight Committee, there\u2019s pretty good reason to conclude that the comments did make it to and were buried by EPA, versus by DOE,\u201d Horner said. Whatever happened to the comments, other evidence also suggests the EPA never put much stock in the capabilities of CCUS technology. In May 2024,two dozen states filed a lawsuitover relatedEPA ruleswith the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. The following October, the Louisiana Public Service Commission (LPSC) asked the court to allow them tofile a briefin support of the lawsuit. The LPSC said in their petition that the EPA\u2019s own modeling showed far less confidence in carbon capture than it had publicly stated. The agency\u2019sIntegrated Planning Modelprojects no combined-cycle natural gas units will have carbon capture technologies added through 2055, which is the end of the project period. The EPA also projects that no coal units will be constructed with carbon capture through 2055. The modeling document shows that only one gigawatt of existing coal capacity will be operating through 2055. An EPA spokesperson toldJust the Newsthat the EPA, as part of its reconsideration of the CPP2, is developing a proposed rule, which will be published once it has completed an inter-agency review and been signed by EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin. \u201cMany have voiced concerns that the last administration\u2019s replacement for that rule is similarly overreaching and an attempt to shut down affordable and reliable electricity generation in the United States, raising prices for American families, and increasing the country\u2019s reliance on foreign forms of energy,\u201d the spokesperson said. Kill shot Horner said these comments missing from the administrative record provide a means by which the EPA could effectively nullify the rule. In 2021, the Supreme Court killed Obama\u2019s \u201cClean Power Plan\u201d with its ruling inWest Virginia v. EPA. The challenged rule set emission reduction targets that could be met by either eliminating coal-fired power plants and replacing them with natural gas turbines, improving energy efficiency, or increasing the use of wind and solar power. The court ruled that the EPA had exceeded its authority by trying to control the nation\u2019s power system generation, because Congress did not grant an administrative agency such control without a clear statute granting that broad authority. The court, however, affirmed the agency\u2019s ability to regulate carbon dioxide emissions at new and existing power plants. By using carbon capture without any required generation shifting, the Biden administration likely expected to avoid any conflicts with the ruling. Horner said that, if the parties agree the record is incomplete, the Trump administration\u2019s EPA can avoid arguing for months whether CCS has been adequately demonstrated. By simply documenting that the record shows the agency knowingly and falsely claimed CCS was adequately demonstrated, that\u2019s the end of it. Horner said he doesn\u2019t think the D.C. Circuit court would ignore that fact and deny the agency the opportunity to clean its own house. \u201cThere seems to me no chance the parties would be denied an agency confession of error. That\u2019s what\u2019s really grabbing me about this. These guys have a kill shot, and I don\u2019t know if they know it,\u201d Horner said. **Share this:** Click to print (Opens in new window)Print Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window)Email Post More Click to share on GETTR (Opens in new window)GETTR Tweet Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window)Telegram **Like this:** **Related** **Discover more from Watts Up With That?** Subscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.

It\u2019s what they do on every topic of political interest Don\u2019t believe a thing a Democrat says unless you check it first. They are not trustworthy. Mr. Abbott: Yes, dems lie, but specifically they hide evidence to obscure truth. And they do it like the mafia disposes of the smoking gun, right in front of you. It used to be, bad actors only regretted getting caught, but dems don\u2019t even do that anymore.If you read the Federalist (I recommend) you\u2019ll learn FBI agents had the capacity to hide efiles to the point supervisors could not find the files. It\u2019s a huge scandal, a US senator named Grassley is on it, but the story has not gotten legs. Yet. The CPP2 requires all coal plants to install carbon capture technology by 2039, which captures and stores emissions in underground geological formations. which captures and stores emissions in underground geological formations. which captures and stores emissions in underground geological formations. ________________________________________________________________________ Sequestering CO2 is stupid. About 15 years ago, Drax power stations (UK) declared an intention to install CC and store it under the North Sea. Yes I thought, I\u2019ll believe it when I see it. Some years later they abandoned the idea, because it was too costly. AND dangerous! Drain that swamp. Let\u2019s not forget that COVID deindustrialisation didn\u2019t afffect the idiosyncratic shapes of the Keeling curve sawtooth. So what does that mean. Oh and you can\u2019t have climate change without change in tropical cyclones. QED A 10 to 20% dip for barely 2 months would not show up in such a noisy signal. My point ils that the idiosyncratic sawtooth is not noisy. Lay your ruler against the peaks and troughs of the sawtooth over the COVID years and it\u2019s a dead straight line and the idiosyncratic shape is pretty similar thu\u2019out Years not months When democrats say \u201cfollow the science\u201d they really mean \u201cpush the agenda and make \u2018the science\u2019 fit later. Sort of how the IPCC functions. EPA functions the same way. I have researched a number of drat rules that make citations into research that support their desired outcome. But when I went back to look at the papers, there was more information that countered the results EPA was trying to support. They know most people will not go read the referenced papers but instead just accept the referenced paper supports the conclusion. From the article: \u201cExperts warned the rules would drive up electricity costs and destabilize the grid by disincentivizing reliable power from coal and natural gas in favor of intermittent wind and solar power.\u201d This was the whole purpose of requiring CO2 capture. They wanted to put fossil fuel power plants out of business. There\u2019s a coal-fired power plant near where I live. Obama was trying to force them to convert to natural gas, but after the Supreme Court ruling, this pressure was no longer there. The coal-fired power plant is still producing our electricity. During the blackouts of 2021, our coal-fired power plant never missed a beat. And we\u2019re happy about that! \ud83d\ude42 Science am I! Was it Dr. Fauci, or some other (super)scientist? I think the DC Circuit will excuse any misconduct by a Democratic administration. Noble Cause Corruption 101. Is it really fair to call it \u201cBiden\u2019s EPA\u201d? Maybe Americans should just assume those 4 years were post-Covid filler. Every EPA employee who signed off on this lying and cheating should be fired. I don\u2019t give a damn what any administration says if it\u2019s lying and cheating don\u2019t do it. If you are forced to do it officially record your view. It appears so bad right now I wonder if it wouldn\u2019t be better to get rid of everyone and start over or dismantle the agency.
