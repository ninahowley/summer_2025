Chef Jodhann Mourra, owner of Le Romarin Catering, joined the show to showcase a staple of Haitian cuisine: pikliz\u2014a spicy pickled slaw that adds heat and zest to any dish. \u201cWe\u2019re an international catering company based in Coral Gables, but our heart is in transforming traditional Haitian dishes into something luxurious,\u201d said Mourra, who is originally from Haiti and has been cooking in South Florida since 2019. A former restaurateur at FIU and now the culinary force behind Le Romarin, Chef Jodhann focuses on keeping Haitian food approachable and upscale. During the segment, he walked viewers through a quick-and-easy version of pikliz, using shredded cabbage, carrots, onions, shallots, and his personal favorite: green bell peppers for flavor control. He also offered tips on adjusting the heat by leaving scotch bonnet peppers whole or slicing them for more intensity. \u201cIf you like more carrots, add more carrots. If you prefer more peppers, add more peppers. It\u2019s totally customizable,\u201d he explained. Though pikliz is commonly served with griot (fried pork), tostones, or fried plantains, Mourra insists it's good on everything\u2014from ribs to rice. Le Romarinis located at 6801 SW 8th Street, Coral Gables, FL.
