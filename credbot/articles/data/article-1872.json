The Disappearance of Karlie Guse Collateral Damage Editorial **ACJ Obtains Livestream of Coco Berthmann Asking for Donations, Detailing Cancer Diagnosis** **ACJ has obtained Coco Berthmann\u2019s February 5, 2022, Instagram livestream from a follower who\u201cknew something was off\u201dand decided to hit record. In the 13-minute video, Berthmann reveals her cancer diagnosis and prognosis, her symptoms, pain, and the struggles ahead. She also \u201cfeels bad for asking\u201d for help in any kind of \u201cfinancial way\u201d.** Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice? According to a press releaseby police, the creator of Coco Berthmann\u2019s GoFundMe claimed she [Berthmann] never asked her for money but\u201chad expressed financial concerns\u2026 due to the treatments being expensive.\u201d Her February 5, 2022, Instagram livestream says otherwise. American Crime Journal was able to secure a recording of the livestream from a source who wishes to remain confidential, we\u2019ll call her \u201cMaria\u201d. She had originally been following Berthmann\u2019s story and was slightly suspicious and admits she had not donated to Berthmann or her foundation because she \u201cnever trusted where that money would be going\u201d. Maria said,\u201cwhen the cancer claims popped up, something in me said to just screen shot and record everything. So, I did\u201d She revealed that she had seen Lynn Packer\u2019sreports on Coco Berthmann, debunking her fantastic human trafficking story. LikeElizabeth Frazier, Coco briefly kept a low profile, but last month began asking her followers for donations to adopt a dog. We began getting messages from concerned and angry followers who felt that Berthmann had not addressed the report or taken it seriously. Many of the were former donors. Late last month, Berthmann was at it again, she had taken to Instagram revealing more horrible news. According to Maria,\u201cIimmediately knew something was off, though even before then, and especially after the hoax reports came out in August, I didn\u2019t believe most of what she said. I felt like no one took it seriously. It was completely mind blowing to me that no one was talking about it\u201d I agree. While some took articles and videos down, not a single one issued a public statement outside Lynn Packer\u2019s original reports onCoco BerthmannandElizabeth Fraiser. Here is a one-minute clip of Coco\u2019s cancer claims, we will release the full video tomorrow. Roughly a month ago, dozens of people- mostly former supporters of Coco Berthmann reached out letting us know she had finished taking a break from advocacy against the$154 Trillion a year human trafficking industry(yes, she claims the industry is three quarters of the Gross World Product) and was seeking donations once again. First, she was seeking donor money to adopt a dog, then it quickly evolved into cancer. What is more concerning, is the fact that I contacted over a dozen publications, podcasts and human trafficking advocacy groups and just a few have since pulled their coverage and reporting of the \u201cCoco Berthmann Sex Trafficking Survivor Story\u201d (which seems like a rejected Lifetime Movie script). The Elizabeth SmartFoundationimmediately withdrew their support when Lynn Packer contacted Ed Smart shortly before his report on Coco Berthmann was released. With the exception ofLDS Living, not a single one has retracted their claims and apologized for peddling human trafficking horror fantasies and myths. In fact, organizations like The Malouf Foundation, Adaptive Ops, Operation Underground Railroad, and individuals like U.S. Senator from Utah Mike Lee, continue to either profit or benefit from these bogus human trafficking horror stories. It\u2019s also important to note thatLDS Livingpulled their story on Coco before Packer\u2019s report,afterbeing contacted by a LDS family with evidence that called into question the legitimacy of Berthmann\u2019s story, and who had previously been contacted by Berthmann\u2019s mother, Renata Ruff.LDS Livingpulled the story not only because they could not verify so much as a single claim made by Berthmann, but uncovered evidence that contradicted her claims. Rather than properly retract the story and apologize for misleading their readers and Berthmann supporters, they allow the legend to continue. The Malouf Foundation still has yet to acknowledge or apologize for presenting two \u201cprofessional victims\u201d, as human trafficking survivors. At their inaugural Human Trafficking Policy and Education Summit last April, Coco Berthmann andElizabeth Frazier, were two of the three \u201csurvivors\u201d featured. Utah elected officials such as Senator Mike Lee and Representatives Blake Moore, John Curtis, and Burgess Owens were in attendance. The third victim featured, Julie Whitehead who is also an employee of the organization has long been aware that their stories were in question and refuted by evidence long before Coco\u2019s cancer scam and arrest became a problem. What value has the public received from wild human trafficking fantasies that are nothing more than a campfire for adults to hear scary human trafficking horror stories? That\u2019s exactly what all these summits, foundations and meetings are. Actual human trafficking stories are not that compelling, right? We all know why.
