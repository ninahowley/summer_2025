The pressures of academic schedules, early mornings, and packed calendars ease\u2014offering a welcome pause. But for families of teens and young adults with autism and other special needs, summer presents a different kind of challenge: the sudden loss of structure. For individuals with autism, routine and predictability are not just helpful, they are essential. A structured environment provides clarity, reduces anxiety, and supports success. During the school year, students benefit from a consistent schedule filled with familiar faces, planned activities, and clearly defined expectations. When that structure abruptly ends, it can create confusion, heighten behavioral challenges, and increase stress for both the individual and their family. Some schools offer extended school year programs, but these are not universally accessible. For families without access to these programs, the sudden loss of routine can make the summer months especially challenging. At the Living and Learning Enrichment Center, we recognize this gap and work to fill it with our summer camp and social programs tailored for teens and adults with autism and related needs. Our summer camp at Living and Learning\u2019s 12-acre Northville campus runs from late June through mid-August and offers a full-day experience for teens and young adults with disabilities that is built around structure, routine, and familiarity. Participants engage in consistent activities that promote social interaction, skill development, and fun, all while preserving the predictability they rely on. Regardless of the number of weeks they attend, the goal is the same: to create a safe, inclusive space where individuals can thrive and develop social skills and independence, and to provide tailored experiences that meet the unique needs of each camper while promoting personal growth, learning and fun. If camps are not accessible to some families, meaningful activities at home can help make the summer experience more manageable and rewarding. Families can promote structure at home through the following strategies. \u2022 Keep a daily routine. Choose one to three consistent tasks or activities to do each day, whether it\u2019s a morning walk, afternoon reading time, or evening chores. \u2022 Use visual schedules. These can help illustrate the day or week ahead, reducing anxiety around what\u2019s coming next. \u2022 Front-load expectations. Explain in advance what will happen that day, especially if plans deviate from the norm. \u2022 Introduce countdowns. Mark the transition into and out of summer with visual countdowns to help ease into school\u2019s return. \u2022 Incorporate community activities. Set specific times for local park visits, library trips, or free city events to add structure while exploring what\u2019s available. Even simple actions\u2014like keeping wake-up times consistent\u2014can make a big difference. As the end of summer approaches, begin adjusting schedules to align with the upcoming school year. Gradual changes are more effective and far less stressful than sudden shifts. Ultimately, inclusion during the summer means understanding that not all children and young adults experience \u201cfree time\u201d the same way. Predictability creates a sense of security and happiness. When we build that into our summer plans, whether through community programs, structured camps, or intentional home routines, we support individuals with special needs and empower entire families to enjoy the season with less stress and more success. Let\u2019s rethink summer not just as a break, but as an opportunity to be more inclusive, compassionate, and aware of what every individual needs to thrive.
