INTERNET \u2013 EXHILARATING new developments as Revenge Pornographers LOCK DOWN TANTALIZING LEAKS: GLENN GREENWALD GAY; CONFIRMED! The raunchy expos\u00e9 follows YEARS of tedious genocide coverage by the failed journalist, hosted confusingly on Power-Zionist Peter Thiel\u2019s shock news site RUMBLE\u2122. Greenwald had been whining endlessly about incinerating toddler or some such rubbish, but all the while he was betraying their interest \u2013 and yours \u2013 by soliciting GAY ACTION. Thiel complained to Chronicle, \u201cI-I-I-I-I- I just told him to\u2026. To\u2026. to stop! I said, I said GLENN. We- you- I- w- you can\u2019t do this! I can\u2019t host this! You think- you think- what, you think it makes any difference if- if- if- if you\u2019reJewish?Buddy, that\u2019s precisely who they\u2019re locked in on! You think I want these people coming afterme?!You\u2026 I\u2026 You\u2026 There\u2019s a very strict protocol for these business arrangements. I-I-I-I- I told him\u2026. Glenn! You have to STOP!\u201d Get ready, because what you\u2019re about to see next on this web article will chill you to your very bone. Glenn Greenwald in dainty maid and skirt pantyhose gruesome fetish FUCK . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . I CAN\u2019T FUCKING BELIEVE IT, CAN YOU? WILL ANYTHING EVER BE THE SAME AFTER THIS?! The breaking story reached front desk of Lebal Drocer CEO Raleigh T. Sakers who all but confirmed Mossad was behind the hit. \u201cThis is almost certainly Mossad\u2019s doing, I go golfing with the guy who keeps hold of this filth. He has his own private server.Petabytes of the shit. \u201cBut you listen to mecockroach, I\u2019ve been happy to let the Chronicle slide into irrelevance to avoidpreciselythis type of scandal. You think I want my good friends smeared in my own paper? Not a chance! We\u2019ve got a fundraiser coming up for the annual Fair Saint Louis Parade and I donotwant our biggest donorsunhappy. \u201cIf you so much asthinkof publishing even thefaintestallusion that Mossad is behind this? You better believeyou\u2019llbe the next one in tight panty girdle on the front page of the New York Post! Oh, what\u2019s that? No such thing exists?WHAT DO YOU THINK WEHADTHAT AI BUILT FOR? WRITING ARTICLES? GET OUT OF MY OFFICE!\u201d Long time collaborator and heterosexual icon Andrew \u201cWoiv\u201d Auernheimer was shocked and appalled, \u201cthis whole time I thought Glenn was Aryan and straight, but it turns out he\u2019s Jewish and gay? What the fuck, man!\u201d Greenwald did everything in his power to rehabilitate Auernehimer\u2019s public image after a neo-nazi hack gone wrong, but it just wasn\u2019t enough. Old wounds now re-open, and the salt inserts directly, \u201cit\u2019s given me a lot to think about that\u2019s for sure! HAH! HAH! HAH!\u201d None were more bothered by it though than old friend and collaborator Ethan Klein of h3h3 fame. Klein recently fell into a heaping pile of dung when it got accidentally revealed his wife \u201cHila\u201d Klein was a former raider in the Israeli Defence Force. The controversy saw users haemorrhaging out of his podcast \u2013 and spondulix out of his pocket. Klein worked quick to control the damage, but it just wasn\u2019t enough. In a last ditch attempt h3 swallowed his pride and solicited donations for Palestine, but accidentally gave all of it to Ahmed Fouad Alkhatib, a Palestinian, yes, but sneakily employed by the Atlantic Council, direct facilitators of the democide. With no where left to turn, Klein\u2019s only hope was a puff piece at the intercept from him old chum Greenwald Glenn, but it turned out he was batting for the other side. \u201cAfter all these years my good friend Glenn Greenwald can\u2019t even lift a finger to write some positive press about me? It pisses me off!\u201d \u201cFor months on end now he\u2019s been brow beating me, Ethan your perspective\u2019s all wrong, Ethan you\u2019re on the wrong side of history. Ethan. Ethan. Ethan. Ethan. But the whole time this is what he\u2019s doing? Maybe those kidsdeserved to dieif this is who\u2019s really pushing their agenda!\u201d **Lebal Drocer.
