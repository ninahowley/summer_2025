For Melissa, that mother\u2019s intuition kicked in within the first few weeks of bringing her newborn son, Quest, home from the hospital. At first, there was no indication of any gastrointestinal issues and Quest seemed perfectly healthy. He passed meconium, the first stool babies have, which is often formed in the intestines when the baby is still in the womb and generally passed within 24 hours of birth. Like many parents, Melissa kept a diaper chart. She and Quest\u2019s father noticed instead of full bowel movements, Quest had small smudges in his diaper. Quest\u2019s pediatrician reassured the new parents that breastfed babies sometimes have constipation issues that can be resolved on their own. \u201cThen the bowel movements seemed to be taking longer,\u201d Melissa remembers. \u201cLike, we're at, you know, two, three weeks, no bowel movement. At 3 weeks old, he finally had one and I remember hearing him scream. I picked him up and he had extremely hard stool.\u201d A Lifechanging Diagnosis When Quest was 5 months old, the new parents received a referral from their pediatrician that would change Quest\u2019s life for the better. They met withDan McClenathan, M.D., the chief of theDivision of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutritionat Johns Hopkins All Children\u2019s Hospital in St. Petersburg, Florida. \u201cDr. McClenathan was concerned for Hirschsprung's disease,\u201d Melissa says. \u201cSo, we did biopsies that came back abnormal, but negative for Hirschsprung's disease.\u201d That led to more testing. Quest had three biopsies, two radiology tests, multiple sets of labs and one surgery. Finally, a biopsy came back with the answer McClenathan had been seeking: hypoganglionosis. Hypoganglionosis is a rare intestinal condition characterized by a reduced number of ganglion nerve cells in the gut. \u201cGanglion cells are nerve cells in the lining of the colon,\u201d McClenathan explains. \u201cWithout these cells, the motility of the colon is not normal. These cells help the colon contract and move. There is a condition called Hirschsprung's where there is complete absence of these cells. We then have very infrequent cells, and this is where we see hypoganglionosis, which is extremely rare.\u201d McClenathan says with pediatric GI patients, it\u2019s important to find a diagnosis. \u201cWe knew there was something wrong, so we kept pushing for answers,\u201d McClenathan says. \u201cFinally, we came to a diagnosis, and this helps tremendously with creating a good treatment plan and a better prognosis.\u201d Surgical Solutions Quest was put on a regimen of supplements that can serve as laxatives for young children. \u201cThey would work and then they would stop working,\u201d Melissa says. \u201cSo, Quest began to get admitted to Johns Hopkins All Children\u2019s Hospital for cleanouts because he was so backed up with stool. Sadly, nothing was consistently working for him.\u201d At one point, Quest was coming in on a monthly basis to Johns Hopkins All Children\u2019s for cleanouts. McClenathan continued to seek a better solution, eventually recommending a gastrointestinal motility specialist \u2014 an expert in how muscles move food through the body \u2014 in Orlando. There, doctors found about 20 centimeters of Quest\u2019s large intestine were not functioning. Doctors in Orlando recommended and performed a colostomy, which is a surgical procedure where an opening (stoma) is created in the abdominal wall to divert stool from the colon (large intestine) through a pouch instead of the rectum. Quest\u2019s colostomy operation was in January 2025, but Melissa says already he\u2019s doing remarkably better. Quest, who will turn 3 years old in July, is constantly on the go. \u201cHe's thriving, he's happy, nothing is stopping him,\u201d Melissa says. \u201cHe plays and has no more tummy aches, no more hospital visits for cleanouts.\u201d Melissa has also made sure Quest\u2019s stoma (the area where the stool is diverted into a pouch) has become a normal part of his life. Quest even named the stoma: Cuffy. \u201cI love it because I want him to be proud,\u201d Melissa says. \u201cI want him to be proud of his stoma because, the stoma saved his life.\u201d McClenathan says Quest\u2019s outlook is bright. \u201cQuest will always deal with constipation, but long term, it will get better as he ages,\u201d he says. He also adds parents should take the initiative, like Melissa did, to look out for any potential issues. \u201cParents should look for major constipation, bleeding, poor growth and feeding issues to indicate a possible GI issue in young babies,\u201d McClenathan adds. \u201cParents would typically raise these questions with their pediatrician. Pediatricians are experts at determining if this is a normal phase or abnormal and refer to GI subspecialties if needed.\u201d Melissa has used Quest\u2019s experience to advocate on behalf of children with rare gastroenterology issues by becoming an ambassador through a group called REACH, which is committed to improving the lives of children and families with Hirschsprung\u2019s disease to promote education and research. \u201cMy advice is to push for your child, push for yourself, and push for answers from your child\u2019s specialist,\u201d she says. \u201cMy experience with Dr. McClenathan has been nothing short of amazing. He listens to us. He is willing to investigate our concerns. He saved my baby. I couldn\u2019t be more grateful.\u201d Expanded Care This spring, Johns Hopkins All Children\u2019sacquired the Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition practice. Although the GI practice has partnered with Johns Hopkins All Children\u2019s for 40 years, McClenathan says the acquisition will make a difference. He founded the gastroenterology practice in 1984. \u201cOur practice and All Children\u2019s have come a long way through the years,\u201d McClenathan says. \u201cI\u2019m proud of being able to care for so many families, and this helps ensure our team will be able to continue to care for kids for generations to come.\u201d This transition gives patients greater access to tools such as the MyChart patient portal, which connects patients and families with electronic health records and care instructions and enhances communication with the clinical team. The gastroenterology team now has greater ability to use the research and resources of Johns Hopkins Medicine, and the hospital will be able to build on the gastroenterology program\u2019s success as it expands toa second hospital campus in Wesley Chapel. That campus is scheduled to open in 2027. Feeding Therapy As for Quest, he\u2019s thriving in another program at Johns Hopkins All Children\u2019s as well. He takes part in feeding therapy where he\u2019s learning through games and play how to swallow and chew foods more carefully. While not related to the hypoganglionosis, Melissa says Quest has been prone to choking on food since he was a baby. Doctors suspect it may be due to a delayed epiglottis, meaning his epiglottis (the flap-like cartilage that covers the trachea during swallowing) may not close completely or quickly enough while Quest swallows. Quest has been working for several months with Sophia Reh, M.S., CCC-SLP in theSpeech-Language and Feeding Therapyprogram. Together, they focus on taking small bites and chewing completely. \u201cIt\u2019s making a big difference,\u201d Melissa says. \u201cWe had several close calls where he would swallow something whole, choke and I would have to pat him on his back to get the food out. It\u2019s scary.\u201d Melissa says Quest\u2019s therapy sessions with Reh, or \u201cMs. Sophia\u201d as Quest calls her, are making all the difference. \u201cHe's learning a lot from her and he's taking it home with him. He tells me when we sit at the table \u2018I'm chewing, mommy.\u2019 He will show me how he chews his food. So, it's helping him a lot. I'm very thankful for this program.\u201d Reh is thrilled with Quest\u2019s progress as well. \u201cHe\u2019s been doing amazing with feeding therapy. When we first started, he had very minimal oral intake. He had difficulty chewing food and difficulty consuming an adequate amount of intake to support his nutritional needs. So, we've been working on both improving his intake and his chewing skills, and he's made huge progress in just the few months we've been together,\u201d she says. \u201cWe make it a positive experience for Quest because feeding can be difficult, especially when you have underlying GI issues, so we focus on making him feel accomplished and proud,\u201d Reh said. Reh also helped Quest find a better cup for drinking fluids and better head positioning to enhance Quest\u2019s oral motor skills. \u201cHe's come super far, making huge progress, so I'm very proud of him, and I love working with him,\u201d Reh adds. Melissa is grateful for both the GI and feeding therapy programs for how much they\u2019ve helped her son to thrive. \u201cI\u2019ve had nothing but a great experience with Johns Hopkins All Children\u2019s. The doctors and nurses here are amazing and I see them as my child\u2019s heroes. We are so grateful they\u2019re in our lives.\u201d **TreatmentDivision of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Nutrition & Hepatology at Johns Hopkins All Children's** **News & Publications** Home E-Newsletters Publications Social Media Community For the Media (Newsroom) Podcasts **** Espa\u00f1ol \u12a0\u121b\u122d\u129b \u7e41\u9ad4\u4e2d\u6587 Fran\u00e7ais Tagalog \u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 Portugu\u00eas Italiano Ti\u1ebfng Vi\u1ec7t \u0181\u00e0s\u0254\u0301\u0254\u0300-w\u00f9\u0256\u00f9-po-ny\u0254\u0300 Igbo asusu \u00e8d\u00e8 Yor\u00f9b\u00e1 \u09ac\u09be\u0982\u09b2\u09be \u65e5\u672c\u8a9e \ud55c\uad6d\uc5b4 Krey\u00f2l Ayisyen \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629 Deutsch Polski \u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac \u0a97\u0ac1\u0a9c\u0ab0\u0abe\u0aa4\u0ac0 \u0e20\u0e32\u0e29\u0e32\u0e44\u0e17\u0e22 \u0627\u064f\u0631\u062f\u064f\u0648 \u0641\u0627\u0631\u0633\u06cc \u0939\u093f\u0902\u0926\u0940 Deitsch \u1781\u17d2\u1798\u17c2\u179a"}
