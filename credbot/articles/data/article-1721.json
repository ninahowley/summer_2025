I was joined by a powerful coalition of moms who all want to get the harmful chemicals out of our food to protect our future generations. To have this opportunity to expose the truth about how Big Food poisons us with ingredients they don\u2019t use overseas was a DREAM COME TRUE. I had my charts with me to show how billion-dollar corporations like PepsiCo, Kellogg\u2019s, Mars, General Mills and Coca-Cola make safer versions of their products to sell in other countries. You could hear gasps in the room as I went through the ingredient comparisons! It was extraordinary to sit there across from the Department Secretaries (HHS, USDA, Education) where this is now a major topic of discussion! I\u2019m so grateful that we now have leaders at the highest levels of government who are making this a top priority and looking to make changes fast. A post shared by Vani Hari | Food Babe (@thefoodbabe) This week really felt like a \u201cpinch me\u201d moment because I can\u2019t believe how far we\u2019ve come in just the past few months\u2026 Everything has been moving so fast, but nothing can stop us now. This week I alsospoke at the Florida State Capitalin support of a bill that will require warning labels on products with artificial dyes, just like they have in Europe. This is our moment! But there is so much work to be done. Most people still don\u2019t know that food corporations have reformulated safer products to sell in Europe.
