I\u2019ll wake up grumpy, tired and irritated. It\u2019s an awful way to start my day. But by the time it\u2019s bedtime, even though I know I should hit the hay, I end up scrolling on my phone and watching random clips thatrot my brain.It\u2019s a tough cycle to beat. I wish I could wake up feeling refreshed, in a good mood and ready to tackle my morning. I'm coming to realize how much the things we do before bed impact the quality of our sleep and, subsequently, how we feel the next day. Here's what sleep experts have to say about it. **Impact of Bad Sleep** I\u2019m not the only one gettingpoor sleep. Approximately 50 to 70 million people in the US experiencesleep disordersthat impact theirmental and physical health.Although I feel the effects in the morning, they tend to go away after my firstcoffee. Just because the terrible feeling doesn\u2019t last doesn\u2019t mean that constantly getting bad sleep doesn\u2019t have long-term effects. Getting less than seven hours of sleep per night can increase your likelihood of developing depression, anxiety, heart attack, stroke, diabetes, poor glucose tolerance, hypertension and obesity.I don\u2019t have these conditions now, but I don\u2019t want to be at risk for them later in life. I asked sleep experts for advice on how to wake up feeling happier in the morning. **What to Do At Night to Be Happier in the Morning** Meredith Broderick, MD, sleep neurologist andOzlo SleepMedical Advisory Board Member, explains that waking up happy in the morning is a sign ofgreat sleep health. **1. Plan Ahead** Dr. Broderick shares thatfeeling refreshed in the morningrequires planning. This means allocating sufficient time for winding down, giving yourself enough time for adequate sleep and keeping aconsistent sleep schedule. \u201c[Waking up happy] tells me the person has likely gotten enough sleep (sleep duration), is sleeping in sync with their circadian rhythm (timing of sleep), [has] great consistency in wake times (sleep regularity), and has purpose and meaning in their waking lives they are looking forward to,\u201d says Dr. Broderick. **2. Create a Peaceful Sleep Environment** Dr. Jade Wu,a board-certified sleep psychologist and Mattress Firm sleep advisor, shares that apeaceful environmentmakes a big difference to the quality of your sleep. The key is to keep your bedroom cool, quiet, and dark. These small shifts can lead to morerestorative sleepand a brighter, happier morning. **3. Use Your Bed For Sleep Only** Annie Miller, a LCSW-C, Therapist and Owner of DC Metro Therapy, who specializes in chronic pain, insomnia, anxiety, and trauma, says that one of the core principles she works on with her clients is to use the bed only for sleep. For instance, try to keep your bed a dedicated space for sleep (not emails, social media scrolling, or even deep thinking). This helps your brain associate your bed with rest, not stress or stimulation. \u201cIf you\u2019re lying in bed awake for too long, especially if your mind is racing, it\u2019s better to get up, do something quiet in dim light, and return to bed only when sleepy,\u201d says Miller. **4. Develop a Winding Down Routine** Dr. Wu shares that to feel happier in the morning, focus on winding down both your body and mind the night before. She recommends setting a consistent bedtime and creating acalming pre-sleep routine. For instance, dim the lights, put away screens, and do something relaxing like reading or gentle stretching. Miller advises building in one to two hours of wind-down time before sleeping. This time should be free from work, to-do lists, or anything overly stimulating. \u201c[Winding down isn\u2019t] about doing something 'perfectly calming\u2019 \u2014 watching a favorite show,reading, or simply zoning out can all be great options. The goal is to signal to your brain that the day is done and that you\u2019re safe to relax,\u201d says Miller. **5. Go To Bed and Wake Up At the Same Time** Miller advises keeping your wake time consistent even after a bad night.Getting upat the same time every morning helps regulate yourcircadian rhythmand builds sleep drive for the following night. It\u2019s tempting to sleep in after a rough night, but doing so can actually make the next night\u2019s sleep worse and lead to grogginess or a low mood during the day. **6. Make Lifestyle Changes** Sleep hygieneis a group of behaviors and habits that can be practiced to help improve the quality of sleep.Dr. Broderick recommends avoiding exercise, alcohol, caffeine, food, bright light, and electronics to help you wake up feeling rested and restored, which is closely related to feeling a sense of happiness or well-being. \u201cIn my personal life, I am very strict about not eating anything after dinner, which is about three to three and a half hours before my bedtime,\u201d shares Dr. Broderick. **7. Use Sound as a \u201cSense of Sleep\u201d** Dr. Broderick is a big fan and believer of using sound as the \u201csense of sleep\u201d. She shares that we often overutilize our visual systems because of electronics and electricity. \u201cDimming down lights, listening torelaxing soundscapeson myOzlo Sleepbudsis my go-to tool, especially when I am feeling burned out and am not in the mood to read,\u201d shares Dr. Broderick. **8. Don\u2019t Bring Stress to Bed** Dr. Wu advises trying not to bringstressfrom the day into bed; if your mind is busy, jot down your thoughts in a journal or practicemindfulness. Miller recommends scheduling \u201cworry time\u201d earlier in the day. So many people try to fall asleep with a mind full of unprocessed thoughts, which negatively affects how they feel in the morning. She advises scheduling 10\u201315 minutes earlier in the day to sit down and write out any worries, decisions, or plans. Giving your brain a structured space to think and process helps reduce the chance of those thoughts returning at bedtime. **9. Treat Yourself With Compassion** Adopting these simple strategies and practicing them consistently can help build more peaceful nights and moregrounded mornings. However, it\u2019s okay if you\u2019re not perfect. Miller recommends developing a mindset where you are gentle with yourself when things don't go as planned. \u201cIf you have a tough night, don\u2019t start the morning by beating yourself up. How you respond to poor sleep can shape the next night\u2019s sleep \u2014 and your mood. A little compassion goes a long way,\u201d says Miller.
