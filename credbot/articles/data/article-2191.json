It is the full story of the inside game in Washington and shows how the permanent political class enriches itself at the expense of the rest of us. It was after completing work on this book that Peter Schweizer realized that to truly expose the mountains of corrupt activities, schemes, side-deals, and crooked politicians in Washington, it would take an organization. He then founded the Government Accountability Institute in 2012. Key findings in Throw Them All Out: Insider trading is illegal on Wall Street, yet it is routine among members of Congress. Normal individuals cannot get in on IPOs at the asking price, but politicians do so routinely. The Obama administration has been able to funnel hundreds of millions of dollars to its supporters, ensuring yet more campaign donations. An entire class of investors now makes all of its profits based on influence and access in Washington. Peter Schweizer doggedly researched through mountains of financial records. With the help of two part-time researchers, he tracked complicated deals and stock trades back to the timing of briefings, votes on bills, and every other point of leverage for politicians in Washington. The work was painstaking and slow, because these are the kinds of records that the powerful do not want people to ever find. But the result is a manifesto for revolution: the Permanent Political Class must go. \u201cSend me a bill that bans insider trading by members of Congress. I will sign it tomorrow.\u201d ~President Barack Obama, State of the Union speech, 2014 The book led to the resignation of Rep. Spencer Bachus from his committee chairmanship. Its deep research and journalistic rigor ledNewsweekmagazine to dub Schweizer, \u201cThe Wonk Who Slayed Washington.\u201d Available everywhere!
