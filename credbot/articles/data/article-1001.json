(KMIZ) -- A new law signed by Gov. Mike Kehoe on Tuesday includes sweeping public safety reforms, including updating the state\u2019s outdated firework regulations. Senate Bill 81, which takes effect Aug. 28, modernizes how Missouri regulates fireworks for the first time in more than two decades, updating technical definitions, safety protocols and inspection authority. \u201cIn terms of the fireworks provisions, there's just a lot of things that needed updated and improved,\u201d Sen. Kurtis Gregory, R-Cooper County, who sponsored the bill, told ABC 17 News. \u201cIn terms of fireworks, I think it's been 25 years and there's been some major advancements in fireworks and definitions needed changed. We had the proper definitions for the proper type of fireworks to make sure we had the right licenses and availabilities out there for everything to be done in a safe manner.\u201d Gregory emphasized that while the state hadn\u2019t experienced enforcement issues, outdated definitions led to confusion. For example, some pyrotechnics commonly seen at sporting events were being mislabeled. \u201cThe correct term is articles pyrotechnic, and that is what you see at football games and celebrations where it's like on a timed button that gets pushed,\u201d Gregory said. \u201cThose are being defined as proximate fireworks. That's not the correct definition at all.\u201d The bill also overhauls the state\u2019s fee structures to help provide training for fire departments across Missouri. Gregory pointed to Missouri\u2019s unique relationship with fireworks as to why the law was necessary. \u201cMissourians per capita spend more money on fireworks than anyone, any other state in the country, by like almost double,\u201d Gregory said. \u201cI think Missourians on average spend about $25 per person on fireworks. The next closest state is just a little over $10.\u201d Industry veteran Bob Geru -- who has owned and operated Bob\u2019s Fireworks in Columbia since 2005 -- has seen Missouri\u2019s fireworks landscape change since entering the business in 1965. \u201cIt was a lot looser than it is today,\u201d Geru said. \u201cBut it's basically been the same. They don't want fireworks in the city. And, you know, I can understand that to a degree.\u201d Still, Geru said any state enforcement presence on his business has been minimal. \u201cI haven't seen an inspector in 10 years,\u201d Geru said. \u201cIf they come in my first thought is \u2018Tell me what I need to do to correct it.'\u2019\u201d Geru also echoed Gregory\u2019s point, noting that Missouri consistently ranks among the top states in fireworks sales nationwide. \u201cMissouri has a reputation amongst all the states as being fireworks-friendly,\u201d Geru said. \u201cI\u2019ve been asked the question many times. Just what is your favorite fireworks? I got a standard answer. Anything with a fuse.\u201d While the law will expand the State Fire Marshal\u2019s authority to inspect retail locations, including those outside counties with local fire codes, it\u2019s not expected to disrupt operations in regulated areas like Boone County. \u201cI think what it really does is it allows the State Fire Marshal's office a little more access to those areas that don't have a fire code,\u201d said Gale Blomenkamp, who is an assistant chief of the Boone County Fire Protection District. \u201cThe trend has been people are leaning towards more of a brick-and-mortar type facility for these temporary fireworks stands because they're easier to secure. Storms don't blow them away, you know, like they're blowing away their tents and their product is more secure and more safe.\u201d Blomenkamp noted that for many counties without their own codes, the law will help close inspection gaps. \u201cThat will allow the State Fire Marshal's office to gain access into those structures, to do those inspections,\u201d Blomenkamp said. Though SB 81 becomes law in late August, its fireworks provisions won\u2019t impact the upcoming Fourth of July season. Full implementation is expected by 2026.
