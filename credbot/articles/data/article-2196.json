Antifa claims to be a \u201ccitizen\u2019s organization dedicating to preparing for and fighting against fascism\u201d. As usual with Democrats, they are hypocritical in their aims and really seek to take-over the state and replace it with fascism. Hmmm, this kind of story sounds familiar, does anyone remember how Stalin came into power from the USSR? He did the exact same thing these \u201cAntifa\u201d folks are doing. Sickening. There is a specialized branch in Antifa, where they inject their best men/women/third rails with tons of anabolic Tom Brady-endorsed steroids and quaaludes to bulk their soldiers to become Supersoldiers, which I had to infer is comparable to the United States Marine Corps, only the Marines have honor, and Antifa seeks to destroy the state with Stalinesque intentions. In any case, Antifa is a terrorist organization and what they did to poor little Timmy from North Dakota is something that needs to be more magnified in our mainstream media, but they are suspiciously quiet about this story. Hmmm\u2026. Lil Timmy, from a God-fearing Protestant household of five, had his home invaded by five or six of these so-called \u201cSuper Soldiers\u201d and asked poor old lil\u2019 Timmy if he would wish them a \u201cHappy Holidays\u201d (sic). Five-year-old Timmy, who can only think from exposure of the mainstream media and perhaps also from his mother, did wish the Antifa Super-soldiers a \u201cMerry Christmas\u201d, and poor old lil\u2019 Timmy from Grand Forks, North Dakota was gunned down not a second later. He was rushed to the hospital but the doctors said he died just as soon as he went inside the ER. He was only 5 years old. Antifa doesn\u2019t care about you or your children, they want blood and they want to seek total control and abolition of the State, IE: OUR COUNTRY. Do not let the Antifa or their Ray Lewis ways of intimidation haunt you or change your political beliefs, that is exactly what they want. They are the American ISIS, and if you dare cross their beliefs, they\u2019ll have their crosshairs on you. Be the God-fearing patriot that you are, and invoke the Second Amendment if need be. These Antifa maniacal bastards only their way to be the American way, and America cannot afford to become a terrorist state. We do not want Islam in America and these Antifa-Isis goons must be labeled as an extremist group from their liberal counterpart, the FBI, if we want to be a safe country that is tough on crime as the president wants it to be. Antifa will find anyone they label as a \u201cdissident\u201d or a \u201cfascist\u201d with their flawed terminology, and their Supersoldiers are the ones that act with total malice. Find your local arms dealer via the NRA or other means of self-protection to counter these liberal coons, it\u2019s your rights you are fighting for, not theirs.
