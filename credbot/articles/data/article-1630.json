The coach was fighting aneight-month battle with cancerthat was diagnosed in November, just six days after the football season ended. Palmer was surrounded by his family \u2014 wife Shannon, son Zachery, and daughters Sarra and Talia \u2014 as well as his father Thomas Palmer and his mother Sheila Morrison Bridges, who both live in Mississippi. He is also survived by his brother Jonathan Palmer, who also lives in Mississippi. Funeral arrangements are being handled by Oak Ridge Funeral Home (1001 E. Grave Avenue, Haines City, 33844). The funeral is set for Friday, with viewing from 11 a.m. to noon, and the service at noon. Palmer, who played college football at Mississippi College and graduated from Louisiana Tech, was born in Bossier City, La. He took over coaching positions at a pair of struggling Central Florida programs with the hopes of steering them in the right direction. In two seasons at Celebration, his teams were 2-18, and he finished 2-8 in his only year atOrlando\u2019s University High last season. \u201cHe was not in any pain. He\u2019s gone to be with Jesus,\u201d Shannon Palmer said. \u201cHe fought until that very last breath. He kept fighting for his family and that\u2019s what Jeremy always did. He fought for the people he loved. \u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking. After watching him this past week, I am just so thankful he is not in any pain. He is going to be missed. He was truly loved by so many people. Too young to be dealing with this.\u201d Six days after the final game last season, Palmer went in for what he thought was going to be routine testing of his esophagus \u2014 procedures he had dealt with since he was 13 years old, when he had surgery. From routine scans, however, doctors found a malignant tumor in his esophagus. Further testing found seven different tumors throughout his body. He had the one in the esophagus, two in the brain and others in his liver, diaphragm and lymph nodes around the stomach. Palmer had brain surgery in December, followed by four months of chemotherapy. At the beginning of May, he was upbeat, positive and optimistic about upcoming scans on June 3. His condition, however, quickly deteriorated in the following weeks, and he was placed in hospice on Sunday. In lieu of flowers, the family is asking that donations be made to theJeremy Palmer Memorial.
