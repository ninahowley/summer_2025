Ohyeah. Thatbox. When I graduated high school, I decided to gather up everything I owned that had meaning to me and put it in a big cardboard box. That was 14 years ago. With almost no memory of what was in the box, I decided to open it up. Inside I found old schoolwork, report cards, things I had written, things my friends had written, pictures, audio and video recordings, tickets of things I had gone to, and a ton of letters. It quickly turned into a very weird day for me. First, it\u2019s been fascinating\u2014it\u2019s amazing how many things you remember incorrectly, and I\u2019ve been doing a lot of revising of off-base memories. Second, I\u2019m a slight emotional wreck\u2014right on the edge of doingthis. But mostly, I spent seven straight hours cringing. Looking at yourself from the outside always has the potential to be mortifying, but looking at yourself and your friends as teenagers is like watching the least endearing, most excruciating reality show ever made. Here\u2019s why: Anyone who knows 9 to 23-year-olds knows that they tend to detract more value from the world than they add, but as you can see on this graph, the teen years, and especially ages 12 to 16, are a full train wreck. The reason we sometimes forget this is that the only people who spend time with teens are other, equally un-self-aware teens, parents of teens (whose judgment is clouded by their love for their kid), and professionals who have chosen to work with teens because they have an inexplicable soft spot for them. All the people in a position to see teenagers for who they actually are don\u2019t come into much contact with them, so we often forget what kind of people they are. But there was no forgetting yesterday, as I pored through this mound of primary sources\u2014especially since in this case, it brought back all the inner thinking behind the way my friends and I were. So all teens reading this, especially those on the younger side: You have a right to live your life, but at least do so with the knowledge that you\u2019re probably bringing down the general quality of the world by being the way you are. I can\u2019t fix you\u2014no one can\u2014but I\u2019ll try to offer some basic suggestions that will help you minimize the amount of embarrassment you\u2019re causing to our species and to your future self: 1) Don\u2019t attempt to be profound, for any reason whatsoever.Profound is not for teenagers, and you\u2019re 100% not an exception. In particular, if one day at the age of 16, you decide to write a short philosophical story in red ink in all tiny capital letters and you\u2019re quivering by the end with a sense of sublime connection to something bigger than yourself, what you should do is A) stop feeling this way, B) keep this whole experience to yourself, and C) throw the story away, since reading it later in life, once you have clarity, will shatter the incorrect, more impressive image you have of yourself as a teen. 2) Don\u2019t be such a dick to your parents, you entitled little shit.You live in a world where 99.9999999% of humans care more about how their hair looks than whether you live or die, and then there\u2019s this person, or two if you\u2019re lucky, who\u2019d give theirlivesfor you. And how do you feel about all this? You feel the exact levels of entitlement and gratitude of this horse: 3) Girls between 11 and 13 and boys between 13 and 15 should implement a strict no-photography policy.For your future self, it\u2019s like being reminded how the hot dog was made. 4) 13-14-year old boys: Your newfound sexuality is extremely icky and upsetting to everyone else. Just a year or two ago, you had a high voice, a microscopic penis, and people found you endearing. A lot of changes have happened in your life since then, and none of them are appealing to the rest of the world. Even your parents are kind of sickened by your whole vibe these days. Here\u2019s the issue: There\u2019s not really anything you can do to shield humanity from what you\u2019re thinking about, since everyone can see it on your greasy little face, so I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s any advice here\u2014just try not to hurt yourself. 5) 12-14-year-old girls: Try to form one notch less of a medieval empire of sadism and tears.There are a few people crueler to their peers than 12-14-year-old girls\u2014 \u2014but not many. One of the things I found in the cardboard box was a photo of some Play-Doh creation of a human head with a bunch of little red spheres stuck to it, which at the time was made by an acne-ridden girl\u2019s peers and passed around the entire 7th grade at school. Another finding was a letter a friend had written me while I was away the summer after 8th grade, telling me that a girl we knew had been crying yesterday because a bunch of people had been hanging out at a house, but they hadn\u2019t invited this one ostracized member of the group, and the girl whose house it was wouldn\u2019t let her in the door when she showed up. No one else can quite understand the psychology of a 12-14-year-old girl, just like we can\u2019t understand the way medieval dictators thought\u2014all you can do is remain wary when you\u2019re around them and be careful never to show weakness. 6) Be aware that there are no winners when a 14-year-old boy decides to grow his hair into a shoulder-length bowl cut. 7) 16-18-year-olds: You\u2019re not in love.You\u2019re insomething\u2014I understand that\u2014but that thing you\u2019re in is very likely not love. What\u2019s happening is that you\u2019re a basket of hormones that has become infatuated with another basket of hormones, and that\u2019s fine\u2014go for it. But if you find yourself tempted to do something like sever an old, otherwise-strong friendship of yours over it, or alter your college-application plans in order to go to college together as a couple, or write some horrifying love note about this person in your high school yearbook\u2014the thing you need to be made clear on is that friends, and college, and paper are real, and your relationship is fictional: This is a graph of a group of sample relationships I created based on no actual data (the graph seemed like a good idea in my head, but then when I made it, it came out totally weird and confusing. Luckily, that\u2019s your problem and not mine). Anyway the point is, when it comes to high school couples, a vast majority of them who are still together after high school ends will be finished by Thanksgiving (late November) of their freshman year of college\u2014the high school relationship wall. The problem is, lots of high school couples are pretty sure that theyjust mightbe that one outlier couple on the graph who actually will end up together forever\u2014except then they won\u2019t make it past the wall. So keep this in mind and try not to bump something over in the realm of long-lasting things for the sake of this relationship. And if,for someincredible reason, you decide to write a song related to this situation of yours, and you choose to write the lyrics on a physical piece of long-lasting paper, and before you graduate you decide to put a bunch of things into a box for the future,understand that you\u2019re only hurting yourself by putting the paper with the lyrics on it into the box, because it\u2019ll cause you to read them when you\u2019re 33 when you had otherwise completely forgotten about the incident. 8) You\u2019re not a Communist, you\u2019re not a Marxist, you\u2019re not an Anarchist, you\u2019re not a Nihilist.No one likes a teenage zealot. Just stop. 9) When your 7th grade girlfriend gives you this note\u2014 \u2014realize that A) it means she\u2019s incredibly not into you, and B) if she has to write her last name, it means your relationship was lacking in the first place. You should also explain to her how to do the \u201cIt\u2019s not you, it\u2019s me\u201d thing correctly, instead of basically saying, \u201cIt\u2019s not you, it\u2019s me\u2014me not liking you.\u201d Whatever you do, don\u2019t convince her to get back together with you, since that\u2019ll just result in you going through all the pain again two weeks later\u2014 If someone you\u2019ve spoken to no more than three times in your life A) is acting like she\u2019s divorcing you after 20 years of marriage, averaging 2.5 sorry\u2019s per note, because of how devastated she thinks you\u2019ll be when you read this, and B) feels the need to use the word \u201clook\u201d with you, which is the step right below a restraining order\u2014and all this from someone who thinks it\u2019s okay to hyphenate the word \u201cwould\u201d\u2014you need to make some big changes. So, teenagers, I suggest you take a long look in the mirror and understand the perils you face by being you. Your entire existence is like a drunk person dancing at a wedding\u2014fun from the inside, horrifying from the outside\u2014so just think about that when you\u2019re choosing what to put in writing, put online, and gather into the box at the end of high school. Your future self might be better off without all the details.
