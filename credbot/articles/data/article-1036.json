(Map from Document 4, INR report on \u201cIndia-Pakistan\u201d) India\u2019s Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi (above) and Pakistan\u2019s Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto developed good rapport during the late 1980s and early 1990s but were too weak domestically to tackle difficult issues such as nuclear weapons. Nevertheless, in 1988, they signed a \u201cNo Attack on Nuclear Facilities\u201d agreement along with other Confidence Building Measures. Benazir Bhutto in Washington, D.C., in 1989. Bhutto lost a familiar top-level Indian interlocutor when Rajiv Gandhi was assassinated in 1991. Washington, D.C., April 22, 2025\u2013 Declassified U.S. intelligence reports from the 1980s and 90s show that, even while the possibility of war between India and Pakistan remained low, the U.S. believed there was a strong possibility that such a conflict could lead to the use of nuclear weapons. A 1989 State Department intelligence report published today for the first time, for example, found that, although a war between the two countries was unlikely, the risk was \u201chigh\u201d that, through a \u201cmiscalculation or irrational response,\u201d a \u201cconventional war \u2026 might turn into a nuclear exchange.\u201d By 1993, the U.S. intelligence community had grown more concerned about the possibility of a conflict in South Asia, assessing it at \u201cabout 1 in 5,\u201d according to a 1993 National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) titled \u201cIndia-Pakistan: Prospects for War in the 1990s\u201d also published today for the first time by the National Security Archive. The CIA released much of the NIE\u2019s contents in response to the Archive\u2019s mandatory declassification review appeal. The 1993 NIE found that elements of the tense India-Pakistan relationship that increased risks of conflict were their nuclear rivalries, competing claims for Kashmir, and mutual suspicions of internal interference. Moreover, the coming to power of \u201cextremist\u201d parties in either India or Pakistan could raise the risk of conflict. By the early 1990s, right-wing Hindu political movements were on the rise in India and were associated with increasing communal violence. The possibility of an India-Pakistan conflict was also central to a declassified 1981 Special National Intelligence Estimate (SNIE) that is also published here today: \u201cIndia\u2019s Reaction to Nuclear Developments in Pakistan.\u201d With Pakistan moving forward in its efforts to produce fissile material for nuclear weapons, U.S. intelligence evaluated the possibility of an Indian attack on Pakistan\u2019s nuclear facilities should developments in that country threaten India\u2019s security. According to the SNIE, India would probably take a \u201cwait and see\u201d approach before striking in Pakistan and make a decision \u201cbased on whether Pakistan produced nuclear weapons or stockpiled them.\u201d Accompanying the SNIE is a chilling State Department memo, also published for the first time, on the expected radiological consequences of an Indian attack on the Karachi Nuclear Power Plant (KANUPP). The briefing by Lawrence Livermore Laboratory scientists emphasized the threat of dispersed iodine 131, which was one of the primary radiation dangers associated with the Chernobyl disaster five years later. Under the \u201cextreme conditions\u201d assumed by the scientists who developed the study, \u201cKarachi residents would probably receive a 10 to 20 REM inhalation dose [of iodine 131] as far as 25 km down wind,\u201d an amount \u201c20 times as great as the serious escape of iodine during an accident at a UK reactor at Windscale in the 1960s.\u201d Populous Karachi \u201ccould suffer heavy casualties\u201d under such a scenario, according to the Livermore briefing. The 1989 report by the State Department\u2019s Bureau of Intelligence and Research (INR) titled \u201cIndia-Pakistan Relations: A Delicate Balance\u201d provides perspective on the India-Pakistan rivalry. INR analysts found war to be \u201cthe most improbable of contingencies\u201d because leaders on both sides wanted to avoid open conflict. Yet, \u201chostilities might break out by accident, or an even more unlikely possibility\u2014be triggered by New Delhi\u2019s efforts to take out all of Pakistan\u2019s nuclear weapons facilities in coordinated surgical strikes.\u201d Creating potential for conflict were \u201csuspicions and prejudices\u201d on both sides and \u201cpoints of friction,\u201d such as rival claims for Kashmir and the \u201cmutual charges of interference\u201d\u2014namely, that each was providing arms and assistance to \u201cseparatist extremists\u201d in the other country. There was \u201crisk\u201d that conventional conflict could escalate into a \u201cnuclear exchange,\u201d the INR report found. By the time U.S. intelligence officials had begun to prepare the 1993 NIE, U.S. intelligence officials saw the possibility of India-Pakistan war as greater than \u201cimprobable.\u201d Like INR, the intelligence analysts found that the leaders of both countries wanted to avoid war, but that \u201cflashpoints\u201d such as Kashmir, \u201cinternal meddling,\u201d terrorist incidents, and \u201ccommunal incidents\u201d could ignite crises and confrontations, possibly leading to the use of nuclear weapons. Also increasing the risk of conflict was the possibility that extremist parties could come to power, the Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) (Indian People\u2019s Party) in India and radical Islamists in Pakistan. Yet even if war \u201cwas not on the horizon,\u201d the chance of war could increase through \u201cmiscalculations,\u201d including intelligence failures that could trigger a \u201cpremature attack.\u201d The analysts envisioned circumstances that could cause an \u201cescalating confrontation,\u201d including \u201cprotracted surges of violence in Kashmir,\u201d a \u201clarge scale military exercise in border areas,\u201d or a \u201cspectacular terrorist outrage\u201d that one side could attribute to the other. The greatest miscalculation of all could involve \u201cthe breakdown of nuclear deterrence during a crisis,\u201d especially if military leaders on either side developed \u201chair-trigger responses that ensure crisis escalation.\u201d Since the 1990s, India-Pakistan relations have remained tense. Alert to therisksof conflict between two nuclear armed states, social and natural scientists have studied the possible consequences of a nuclear war between India and Pakistan. According to one scenario described in a 2019 study prepared by climate scientists and nuclear experts, 50 million people could be killed, and the consequences for the global climate could be devastating: the detonations could have effects that would lower temperatures and damage food production. One of the major conclusions of the study was that \u201cany of the India-Pakistan nuclear cases we posit clearly would cause large reductions in agriculture and food shortages\u201d that could lead to \u201cfamine for millions or billions of people.\u201d **Perspectives** The rivalry and tensions discussed in the intelligence estimates and analyses has been a theme in India-Pakistan relations since the 1970s. When Pakistan lost the 1971 war with India, it redoubled President Zulfikar Ali Bhutto\u2019s interest in a nuclear weapons program even if it meant that his country would have to \u201ceat grass\u201d to pay for it. In May 1974, India\u2019s longstanding investment in dual-use nuclear capabilities yielded a \u201cPeaceful Nuclear Explosion,\u201d which in turn motivated Bhutto further to develop nuclear capabilities that he insisted were for \u201cpeaceful\u201d purposes. By the late 1970s, Pakistan was acquiring agas centrifugecomplex for producing highly enriched uranium. India had not taken steps to weaponize its nuclear capabilities but it was developing advanced delivery systems.[1] During 1979 and 1980, U.S. intelligence was learning more about Pakistan\u2019s secret program to produce fissile material for nuclear weapons, in part by using purloined gas centrifuge technology. That development amplified concern in Washington about nuclear proliferation and the implications for stability in South Asia. India was monitoring the Pakistan nuclear situation even more closely because of the potential threat it posed during the years ahead. By 1981, with Pakistani nuclear capabilities moving ahead, U.S. government officials wondered whether those developments would motivate preventive action by India and a new crisis. With Indian leaders opposed to producing nuclear weapons, they may have seen the prospect of a nuclear-armed Pakistan as an intolerable threat, making preventive action worth thinking about. Such concerns led to the commissioning of a national intelligence estimate assessing possible Indian moves, resulting in Special National Intelligence Estimate (SNIE) 31/31-81, \u201cIndia\u2019s Reaction to Nuclear Developments in Pakistan.\u201d In the fall of 1981, Lawrence Livermore\u2019s Special Projects Division analyzed the radiological damage and casualties that could result from an Indian strike against Pakistan\u2019s nuclear reactor near Karachi. (Document 2) Their analysis foreshadowed the radiation dangers caused by the dispersal of iodine 131 that occurred from the 1986Chernobyldisaster and the likely damage that would occur today if Ukraine\u2019s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant experienced severe damage. The scenario of radiation casualties made some Indian strategists see a preventive attack as highly dangerous because a Pakistani counterattack on India\u2019s nuclear installations could cause similar harm. (Document 3) During the years that followed, the possibility of Indian preventive action remained a concern to the Reagan administration because Pakistan was continuing its nuclear weapons program. Washington wanted to avoid a crisis with Islamabad over nuclear issues because of Pakistan\u2019s covert assistance in Afghanistan, yet, by 1986, the administration had lodged 25 demarches to General Zia. To encourage India-Pakistan d\u00e9tente, the U.S. wanted to encourage both countries to adopt \u201cmilitary confidence building measures\u201d [CBMs] that could help them avoid or at least mitigate future crises. In part to encourage movement on that end and India-Pakistan d\u00e9tente more broadly, Secretary of Defense CasparWeinbergertraveled to the region in the fall of 1986. A few years later, a lengthy State Department intelligence report from the summer of 1989 provided perspective on the India-Pakistan rivalry. INR analysts found war to be \u201cthe most improbable of contingencies,\u201d with leaders on both sides wanting to avoid open conflict. But leaders could do little to improve the hostile relationship between their countries because \u201csuspicions and prejudices \u2026 form the bedrock of each country\u2019s world view and security policy.\u201d Adding to potential for conflict were \u201cpoints of friction,\u201d such as rival claims for Kashmir and the \u201cmutual charges of interference\u201d that each country is providing arms and assistance to \u201cseparatist extremists\u201d in the other, for example, alleged Pakistani support for Sikhs. Yet \u201chostilities might break out by accident, or, an even more unlikely possibility, be triggered by New Delhi\u2019s efforts to take out all of Pakistan\u2019s nuclear weapons facilities in coordinated surgical strikes.\u201d Four years later, the intelligence community prepared a national intelligence estimate on \u201cIndia-Pakistan: Prospects for War in the 1990s.\u201d Far from seeing war as unlikely, the analysts reckoned a one in five chance of conflict. Like INR analysts in 1989, the authors of the NIE saw \u201cflashpoints\u201d that could precipitate open conflict, such as the Kashmir problem, \u201ccommunal violence,\u201d and support for separatist extremists. Moreover, the rise of a rightwing Hindu party in India, the Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) (Indian People\u2019s Party) had changed calculations about the risk of war. If the BJP came to power, or if radical Islamists formed a government in Pakistan, the prospects for conflict could increase. What exactly triggered the preparation of the 1993 NIE remains unknown, but the context for it is clear enough: both countries had made strides in their nuclear programs, with Pakistan probably further than India; both sides were supporting militants and separatists in border areas such as Kashmir; anti-Muslim violence in India had led to thousands of deaths; and crises in 1987 and 1990 had generated fear of nuclear conflict. In the United States, a new president, William J. Clinton, was strongly interested in India, in part because he saw it as an emerging world power and a multi-ethnic democracy like the United States. That interest may have prompted him to request the views of the intelligence community on what contingencies, including the possibility of South Asian conflict, might lay on the horizon. The NIE\u2019s estimate of low odds for war during the 1990s proved correct. Yet Clinton\u2019s second secretary of defense, William Perry, saw war as a \u201creal possibility\u201d and tried to promote moderation by encouraging Indian and Pakistani military leaders to hold talks. By the end of the decade, India and Pakistan came close to war. In early 1998, the BJP came to power and on 11 May 1998 tested three nuclear weapons. Pakistan followed suit, which settled any doubts about the nuclear status of both countries, making any potential conflict even more dangerous. In May 1999, Pakistani military forces moved past the Line of Control (LoC) in Kashmir and seized positions in the Kargil area that Indian forces had vacated during the winter. Expecting a weak response from India or even negotiations over the seized territories, Pakistani military leaders did not predict the Indian counteroffensive that occurred in June. While worried about the possibility of escalation, the Clinton administration sided with India and demanded that Pakistan pull back its forces completely and without any conditions. On 4 July 1999, at the height of the crisis, Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif met with Clinton at the White House, who demanded that he announce a withdrawal of Pakistani forces to behind the LoC; otherwise, the United States would blame Pakistan not only for starting a war but also for assisting Osama bin Laden. Having received intelligence that Pakistan might be readying nuclear forces, Clinton emphasized the grave risks of the situation. According to Bruce Riedel, who took notes on the conversation, \u201cSharif very reluctantly agreed to withdraw.\u201d[2] In the months that followed, during 1999-2000, the intelligence establishment prepared a new NIE on the risks of conflict in South Asia. In his account of the period, Riedel wrote that the NIE found that the chances of India-Pakistan war in the next few years had risen to 50-50.[3] **The Documents** Document 1 MDR release to National Security Archive During 1979 and 1980, U.S. intelligence was learning more about Pakistan\u2019s secret program to produce fissile material for nuclear weapons, in part by using purloined gas centrifuge technology. That development amplified concern in Washington about nuclear proliferation and the implications for stability in South Asia. Necessarily India was monitoring the Pakistan nuclear situation even more closely because the potential threat it posed during the years ahead. By 1981, with Pakistani nuclear capabilities moving ahead, U.S. government officials wondered whether Pakistan\u2019s nuclear activities would motivate preventive action by India. Evidently, that concern led to the commissioning of a national intelligence estimate assessing possible Indian reactions. The National Intelligence Council hadapproveda proposal for an intelligence estimate on the topic in the spring of 1981, although it had been under discussion for some months. By November 1981, the result was Special National Intelligence Estimate (SNIE) 31/31-81, \u201cIndia\u2019s Reaction to Nuclear Developments in Pakistan.\u201d The version of the SNIE published here was the result of a mandatory declassification review request by the National Security Archive. When the document appeared on the CIA\u2019s FOIA website around 2015, it received much attention in the Indian mass media under dramatic headlines, for example, \u201cIndira Gandhi planned attack on Pakistan\u2019s nuclear facilities,\u201d (India Today,1 September 2015). In fact, no such claim appears in the estimate (although Document 3, below, indicates the preparation of contingency plans). The SNIE\u2019s exposition consisted largely of \u201cifs\u201d and possibilities, although it drew on some factual reporting on internal discussions in Indira Ghandi\u2019s government. India had staged a \u201cpeaceful nuclear explosion\u201d in 1974 but it had not made decisions to produce nuclear weapons, much less stockpile them. Thus, a Pakistan armed with nuclear weapons could pose a significant security threat. The estimate pointed to recent detailed internal recommendations circulating within the government for \u201cexercising the nuclear weapons option,\u201d but analysts added that \u201cwe do not know whether the Prime Minister favors that course.\u201d With all the uncertainties, the estimate found that India would probably take a \u201cwait and see\u201d approach \u201cbased on whether Pakistan produced nuclear weapons or stockpiled them, which would then lead New Delhi to face a choice of accepting the high probability of a nuclear arms race or destroying Pakistan\u2019s nuclear facilities.\u201d If the Indian government was determined to uphold its non-weapons status, it would have to decide whether the threat of a nuclear-armed Pakistan was severe enough to make it necessary to destroy that country\u2019s nuclear facilities. Yet, such action could risk Chinese intervention on behalf of Pakistan. Thus, a \u201cfinal Indian decision is likely to depend critically on political and strategic circumstances prevailing at that time.\u201d The report closes with an annex on how Indian leaders might think about the development of a small nuclear arsenal, both the pros and the cons. On the positive side was to need to improve the military balance with China and to encourage the \u201csuperpowers to accord India greater respect.\u201d On the negative side was that India did not yet have \u201cunsafeguarded\u201d stocks of plutonium, and the fact that a weapons stockpile would add to military expenditures, especially when considering the costs of delivery systems and \u201chidden costs,\u201d such as for early warning systems. Document 2 National Archives, Department of State Records, Record Group 59, Files of Lucy Benson, Deputy Secretary of State for Security Assistance, Science, and Technology, 1980-1981, box 9, Pakistan (N.P. 1981) Readers of SNIE 31/31-81 of 8 September 1981 (See Document 1) may have wondered, if India did attack one of Pakistan\u2019s nuclear facilities, what would be the effects? That led to the commissioning by the Energy Department and the State Department\u2019s Political-Military Affairs Division of a study on the radiological effects of an attack on the Karachi Nuclear Power Plan (KANUPP). Lawrence Livermore Laboratory\u2019s Special Projects Division (later known as the \u201cZ\u201d Division), which specialized in nuclear proliferation topics, conducted the study, and Alden F. \u201cJerry\u201dMullinswas its project leader and gave a briefing to State Department officials. According to Mullins, the \u201cmost lethal consequences would occur only if the fuel in KANUPP\u2019s core melted down,\u201d the \u201cworst-case scenario,\u201d where a 2,000-pound bomb blew a \u201cone square meter hole in the thick concrete and steel containment shell,\u201d with one-sixth of the total iodine inventory of 800,000 curies of I-131 escaping through the hole. \u201cUnder these extreme conditions, Karachi residents would probably receive a 10 to 20REM[Roentgen Equivalent Man] inhalation dose as far as 25 km down wind,\u201d which would be \u201c20 times as great as the serious escape of iodine during an accident at a UK reactor atWindscalein the 1960s.\u201d Under the worst-case circumstances, Karachi \u201ccould suffer heavy casualties\u201d: \u201cThe worst result of iodine inhalation is latent thyroid cancer, which may take 15 to 30 years to develop.\u201d With about ten percent of thyroid cancers being fatal, Mullins saw a \u201c70% probability that there will be 10 additional latent thyroid cancers in Karachi as a result of the attack; a 60% chance there will be 100 cancers; a 50% chance there will be 200; a 30% chance there will be 1,000; and a 10% chance there will be 20,000.\u201d The impact of iodine releases was predictable, but Mullin saw other potentially grave consequences: the release of other radioisotopes, \u201cprompt radiation\u201d effects (such as gamma radiation), and the impact of blast and heat in the immediate vicinity. The study noted that, if an attack did occur, Pakistan could put before the world its \u201cworst-case projections\u201d of total casualties. \u201cThe final figure could be a huge one,\u201d with significant \u201cpolitical and propaganda impact.\u201d For its part, India could develop damage estimates that \u201cwould probably be higher than Livermore,\u201d which could \u201cdissuade the Indians from hitting KANUPP and, along with other factors, might encourage them to go after softer targets.\u201d Not mentioned was the recent Israeli attack on Iraq\u2019s nuclear reactor, which produced widespread condemnation and could have influenced the thinking of India\u2019s leaders to the extent that they were considering a preventive attack of this sort. International law may have also had an impact on Indian policymakers. Article 56 of the 1949 Geneva Convention\u2019s AdditionalProtocol I(1977) proscribed attacks on installations such as \u201cdykes, dams, and nuclear electrical generating stations\u201d that contain \u201cdangerous forces,\u201d which could put \u201ccivilians at risk from the release of radioactive material.\u201d India (as well as Pakistan) was not a signatory to the Protocol, but the restriction nevertheless stood.[4]Another complication was that the KANUPP reactor was under IAEA safeguards, and an attack would have incensed the Agency by casting doubt on the efficacy of its work. Document 3 CIA FOIA collection, under declassification review through MDR request Six years later, no preventive Indian attack on Pakistani nuclear facilities had occurred. Yet, the Reagan administration saw a continuedriskand the possibility that such a strike could ignite a war. According to this CIA report on decision-making on the Indian nuclear program, intelligence analysts believed that India had contingency plans for such an attack, which some Indian strategists saw as highly dangerous because the \u201cinevitable Pakistani retaliatory attack on Indian nuclear facilities would spread radioactive contamination over large portions of India.\u201d Other U.S. intelligence analysts argued that India\u2019s drive for \u201cregional hegemony\u201d could prompt preventive attacks on Pakistani facilities, such as the Kahuta enrichment plant, whose destruction would minimize radiological dangers. Other U.S. intelligence analysts then saw the probability of Indian action as \u201clow,\u201d not only because of \u201ctraditional indecisiveness and caution\u201d but also because Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi had said \u201cpublicly that such a move would not ensure the eradication of fissile material and components.\u201d Moreover, a preventive Indian strike would \u201calmost certainly begin a war between India and Pakistan.\u201d In December 1985, Gandhi and Pakistan\u2019s dictator General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq met in India, where they reached anunderstandingnot to attack each other\u2019s nuclear facilities. According to this CIA report, \u201cWe speculate that [the agreement] may have been prompted, at least in part, by US importunings in late 1985 that the nuclear issue be resolved between India and Pakistan,\u201d although other intelligence experts believed that it was something that Gandhi had been seeking on his own, even though it was \u201ccongruent with U.S. interests.\u201d Whatever the sources of the Gandhi-Zia understanding were, it remained informal until December 1988.[5]By then, India and Pakistan had gone through the 1987 Brass Tacks crisis, instigated by Indian military exercises, which had raised fears of war and renewed concern among Pakistani leaders about the possibility of an Indian attack on their nuclear facilities. For his part, Gandhi wanted to find ways to reduce nuclear risks. Those interests and concerns provided context for the signing of the December 1988 Non-Attack Agreement when Gandhi traveled to Pakistan for meetings with Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto.[6] Document 4 MDR request to Department of State This 1989 report by State Department intelligence treated an Indian preventive attack on Pakistan\u2019s nuclear complex as \u201cincreasingly unlikely,\u201d not least because the \u201coptimum time\u201d for such action had passed. INR analysts downplayed the possibility of military action or war in general because \u201cneither India nor Pakistan want to fight a fourth war.\u201d With the military balance decisively in India\u2019s favor, Pakistan \u201cwould have little chance of winning\u201d and India would \u201csuffer considerable costs\u201d and have \u201cto decide how to deal with a defeated Pakistan.\u201d The leaders of both countries, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto of Pakistan and Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi of India, had met several times and developed a \u201cpersonal rapport,\u201d but they could do little to improve the hostile relationship between their countries. Both were in weak positions politically in countries where \u201csuspicions and prejudices \u2026 form the bedrock of each country\u2019s world view and security policy.\u201d Adding to the potential for hostilities were \u201cpoints of friction,\u201d such as rival claims for Kashmir, including the Siachen Glacier, \u201cthe highest and bleakest battlefield in the world.\u201d Also adding to friction were \u201cmutual charges of interference\u201d: that each country was providing arms and assistance to \u201cseparatist extremists\u201d in the other, for example, alleged Pakistani support for Sikhs. INR analysts saw some areas of improvement, such as the confidence building agreements, notably the 1988 Nuclear Nonattack Pledge. Although Gandhi\u2019s critics saw this as and other steps that he had supported as an example of his \u201cbeing \u2018soft\u2019 on Pakistan,\u201d INR\u2019s analysts suggested that it could \u201cimprove regional security somewhat by strengthening, legitimizing, and publicizing the commitment of the political leaders on each side not to resort to preemptive strikes as a means of dealing with their neighbor\u2019s nuclear program.\u201d Yet, it \u201ccould encourage further procrastination in confronting\u201d the dangers of the nuclear problem. A detailed account of the military situation between the two countries demonstrated India\u2019s superiority in terms of troops, equipment, and supplies, with the buildup expected to continue. The \u201ccapabilities gap\u201d made Pakistan\u2019s situation even worse. Acknowledging that India faced a \u201cpotential threat from China,\u201d INR experts noted that \u201cIndian forces are still primarily oriented toward Pakistan.\u201d In that context, Pakistan treated its \u201ccovert nuclear program as the ultimate defense against India.\u201d Along with Kashmir and the claims about internal interference, the nuclear programs of each country were the \u201cmost serious\u201d bilateral problem. Neither country had produced nuclear weapons, but the only \u201crestraints\u201d to doing so were \u201cpolitical not technical.\u201d For example, Pakistan could test a device \u201cwithin a few weeks of a decision to proceed.\u201d Having not made decisions to produce nuclear weapons, India \u201cnow faces the prospect of a nuclear-armed Pakistan without having its own nuclear deterrent in place.\u201d If \u201cmounting evidence [demonstrated] that Pakistan has crossed or is about to cross the nuclear weapons threshold,\u201d such as testing a device, Indian leaders would have to make decisions to produce their own nuclear weapons. As \u201cunlikely\u201d as the prospect of India-Pakistan conflict was, there was a \u201chigh\u201d risk that through a \u201cmiscalculation or irrational response,\u201d a \u201cconventional war \u2026 might tum into a nuclear exchange.\u201d Such an outcome could draw the superpowers into the situation. INR even included an Annex with detailed scenarios for three situations, 1) Indian preventive action against Pakistan\u2019s nuclear complex, 2) India initiating a conventional attack, or 3) Pakistan initiates a conventional attack. In all three scenarios, Pakistan \u201csues for peace\u201d only a few weeks after war breaks out. In 1990, months after INR prepared this estimate, a major crisis broke out. Triggered by military exercises and instability in Kashmir, the region was on edge with growing fear of a nuclear confrontation. U.S. diplomats, with Deputy National Security Adviser Robert Gates undertaking a special mission, worked to help defuse tensions. U.S. influence was probably not decisive but it may have helped.[7] The late MaryShoemaker, a Foreign Service Officer with rich experience in South Asian issues overseas and at the State Department, prepared this report when she worked at INR\u2019s South Asia desk. In 1962 when she became married, Departmental regulations forbade her from taking an overseas assignment, and she resigned from the Foreign Service. When the State Department lost an anti-discrimination lawsuit, she restarted her Foreign Service career. Future member of CongressRush Holtalso contributed to the report. Document 5 MDR request to CIA, released under appeal, final appeal pending at ISCAP Four years after INR prepared its report, the U.S. intelligence community conducted a major estimate of the India-Pakistan situation and prospects for conflict which considered developments since 1989. Against the backdrop of the 1990 crisis, significant violence by Hindu nationalists against Muslims in late 1992 and early 1993, growing nuclear capabilities on both sides, and a new U.S. president, William J. Clinton, who was greatly interested in India, the U.S. intelligence community prepared a National Intelligence Estimate on \u201cIndia-Pakistan: Prospects for War in the 1990s.\u201d According to the title page, the NIE was \u201cprepared under the auspices\u201d of Bruce Riedel, National Intelligence Officer for Near East/South Asia. A former CIA intelligence analyst, Riedel worked on the NSC staff during the George H.W. Bush administration and the first months of the Clinton administration and during 1993 rejoined the CIA to become the NIO. After working on the NSC staff, Reidel rejoined the CIA. According to Reidel\u2019s recollections, he worked on the NIE at the end of a process begun under his predecessor, Ellen Laipson.[8] Who requested this NIE, whether it was from the White House or the State Department or senior CIA officials, remains to be learned. The editor approached former CIA and State Department officials who were in government during the period, but they did not recall or would not discuss the matter or did not respond to queries. Despite the numerous excisions in this NIE, major points come through. Looking at the probability of war between India and Pakistan during the years ahead, the drafters of this NIE found that there were relatively low odds: 20 percent. Like INR, the intelligence analysts found that the leaders of both countries wanted to avoid war, but that points of tension \u2013 \u201cflashpoints\u201d \u2013 notably Kashmir, \u201cinternal meddling,\u201d and \u201ccommunal incidents\u201d could ignite crises and confrontations possibly involving the use of nuclear weapons. Yet even if war \u201cwas not on the horizon,\u201d like INR, the analysts believed that the chances of war could increase through \u201cmiscalculations,\u201d including intelligence failures that could trigger a \u201cpremature attack.\u201d The analysts envisioned circumstances that could cause an \u201cescalating confrontation,\u201d including \u201cprotracted surges of violence in Kashmir,\u201d \u201clarge scale military exercise in border areas,\u201d or a \u201cspectacular terrorist outrage\u201d that one side could attribute to the other. The greatest miscalculation of all could involve \u201cthe breakdown of nuclear deterrence during a crisis,\u201d especially if military leaders on either side developed \u201chair-trigger responses that ensure crisis escalation.\u201d The estimate included discussion of the possible contribution of Confidence Building Measures, such as the agreements not to attack nuclear facilities, and to provide advance notification of maneuvers, exercises, and troop movements, but did not take much stock in them because they \u201cmight prove irrelevant in a fast-moving crisis.\u201d Moreover, verification for any of the agreements was \u201cspotty.\u201d Nevertheless, the U.S. had offered to help verify CBMs, and the analysts suggested that the hotline agreement could have the \u201cbest chance of success.\u201d For the most part, the analysts did not see \u201cexternal factors,\u201d such as hostile powers on their borders that constituted a dangerous threat environment for either India or Pakistan. But they postulated circumstances that could raise the chances of war. One was a change in the military balance in India\u2019s favor to the point where Islamabad could feel \u201ceven more threatened by India\u2019s growing military edge,\u201d which could have such destabilizing consequences as Pakistan\u2019s \u201copen\u201d deployment of nuclear weapons. A change in the military balance in combination with the rise of an \u201cextremist\u201d government could raise the risk of war, although \u201cextremists\u201d holding state power in either country was \u201cunlikely\u201d during the 1990s. In Pakistan, it would take the form of an \u201cIslamist\u201d government and in India, an election that brought the Hindu-led right-wing Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) [Indian People\u2019s Party] to power. A \u201cradical\u201d BJP regime could \u201cblunder into conflict with Pakistan\u201d but also \u201cpolarize\u201d Indian society by causing \u201cmore communal violence that would damage relations with Pakistan.\u201d The NIE includes a photograph, with an excised caption, of the mob led by activists from the BJP and related groups that destroyed the Babri Masjid mosque inAyodhyaon December 6, 1992. An Islamist regime in Pakistan, triggered by an economic crisis \u201cand/or a military dictator joining with militants,\u201d could add to instability by \u201cchampion[ing] the cause of India\u2019s Muslims\u201d but also by \u201cpromot[ing] the liberation of Kashmir by openly arming and training anti-Indian militants.\u201d The NIE also includes a discussion of the implications of the India-Pakistan competition for the United States, with both countries seeking U.S. aid to support their positions but also reduce the danger of \u201cinadvertent war.\u201d This section is heavily excised as are the discussions of nuclear proliferation and of the possibility of greater levels of U.S. efforts at \u201cpeacebuilding.\u201d Also fully excised is \u201cAnnex A,\u201d describing Indian and Pakistani nuclear capabilities. **Notes** [1].
