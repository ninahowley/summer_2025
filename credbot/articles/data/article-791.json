The list of MSU qualifiers is as follows: Hailey Coey, long jump Harvey Cramb, 1,500 meters Rob McManus, 3,000-meter steeplechase Olivia Lewis, Giulia Gandolfi, Caroline Hawkes and Peyton Garrison, 4x400m relay Bobcats showed out in Texas!What a group. What a week. \ud83d\udc99\ud83d\udc9b#GoCatsGopic.twitter.com/t7s7YWH3nH The Bobcat women's team made history as Coey and the 4x400m relay team became the first from the program to represent in their respective event at nationals. \"It means a lot,\" Coey said. \"I\u2019m super honored to be able to represent MSU on a national stage, especially being the first long jumper in school history, super excited and I hope I do well job representing us.\" \"Fortunately, we have a really close four-by-four team, we\u2019re together every single day,\" Garrison said. \"We show up to the track, we work together, we got out and eat together, we spend so much time, and I think that helps a lot.\" All the Emotions on a Texas-Sized Night Under the Lights \ud83c\udf9f\ufe0f#GoCatsGopic.twitter.com/fTNPjOhkM6 The relay team made it to nationals in dramatic fashion, as they were the final team to punch their ticket on the last day. The team who initially finished in front of Bobcats in the event \u2014 Northern Arizona \u2014 was ultimately disqualified to give MSU a berth. The Bobcats waited after a protest was filed and eventually the results were made official as Lewis, Gandolfi, Hawkes and Garrison were awarded a top-12 finish. \"At first we were for sure sad because we thought we were the last team out, and then a couple of us girls looked up at the TV, and the TV had said that we had made it,\" Garrison explained. \"Unfortunately, the team that got kicked out was of course another Big Sky school, and of course we wanted them to make it, but fortunately we made it.\" On the men\u2019s team, McManus will be headed to his third outdoor nationals in his signature event, the 3,000-meter steeplechase. He reflected on how he\u2019s grown since the first time on this stage. \"I think there was a little uncertainty to where I fit in at the national stage, and then last year getting the big Q at regionals, making the national meet, I think I felt a lot more secure,\" he said. \"This year, just coming back again, I think I feel even more confident in myself and my ability. I\u2019ve run PRs this season, so I\u2019m just excited to get back.\u201d \ud835\udde7\ud835\udddc\ud835\uddd6\ud835\uddde\ud835\uddd8\ud835\udde7 \ud835\udde3\ud835\udde8\ud835\udde1\ud835\uddd6\ud835\udddb\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddd7 \ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udf9f\ufe0fRob McManus becomes the third Bobcat in history to qualify for three straight NCAA Outdoor Track & Field Championships!#GoCatsGopic.twitter.com/Djo7RCbPsj To round out the qualifiers, sophomore Cramb earned his first berth to outdoor nationals in the 1,500 meters. \"Oh it\u2019s such an honor, and to do it like you said, my sophomore year is a great opportunity, and to be there and put your name with some of the best in the country is pretty awesome,\" Cramb explained. \"I\u2019m pretty excited, I mean this is the sort of thing you dream of when you think about coming to the NCAA, and so to get the opportunity, I\u2019m really pumped about it.\" For the full schedule of events at the meet, clickhere. **Sign up for theBreaking News Newsletterand receive up to date information.** **now signed up to receive theBreaking News Newsletter.** **Coverage of your favorite teams from Montana's Sports Leader** **Coverage of your favorite teams from Montana's Sports Leader** News Weather Community Sports Don't Waste Your Money Support Sitemap Do Not Sell My Info Privacy Policy Privacy Center Journalism Ethics Guidelines Terms of Use EEO Careers FCC Public File FCC Application Public File Contact Us Accessibility Statement Scripps Media Trust Center Closed Captioning Contact KTVHNews/ ktvhnews ktvhnews"}
