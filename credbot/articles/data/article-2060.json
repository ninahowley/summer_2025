After fifteen years of outspokenly moderate musings that seem to have had zero influence (or less) on our dismally divided national politics, I\u2019ve finally decided to retire The New Moderate as an active monthly blog. Why? It wasn\u2019t the lack of recognition, or the fact that I was pouring hours of work into the project without generating a cent of income, or even the failure of my site to spark anything resembling a much-needed moderate movement. No, in the end it was yet another technical glitch that forced me to put my pet blog to sleep. Here\u2019s what happened.Several years ago WordPress suddenly started asking for my password, even though it never demanded one in the past. After trying every password I had ever used in the online universe, I gave up and attempted to change it. You\u2019d think it would be a simple enough matter to change a password, but WordPress needed my current e-mail address to verify my identity. Turns out it had mydefuncte-mail address on file, and I couldn\u2019t update it because \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 I didn\u2019t know my password! Nearly foiled by this diabolical Catch-22, I eventually discovered that the WordPress app on my rarely used iPad Mini didn\u2019t ask for my password. It still recognized me! But as I quickly found out, it\u2019s a royal pain to type a thousand-word column on a cramped virtual keyboard. What to do? I devised a clever plan: I\u2019d type my column on my computer ande-mailit to my iPad. From there I\u2019d copy the column and paste it into the waiting template on WordPress. Done! I used this circuitous route for roughly three years, even weathering a phase during which search engines decimated my traffic by declaring the site \u201cunstable\u201d \u2014 whatever that means incomputerese. Neverthless, I persisted \u2014 until I discovered, just this past month, thatmy iPad Mini was no longer accepting new e-mails! That was the end. The universe was obviously telling me to hang it up and find another pet project. Well, fifteen years isn\u2019t a bad lifespan for a dog or a blog, and we\u2019ve had plenty of good times along the way. No need to weep for me. Granted, I never launched that moderate movement or achieved the exalted status of public pundit, but I can retire with the knowledge that I spoke my mind month after month and said things that needed to be said. (After all, I didn\u2019t have to worry about being fired, threatened by armed insurrectionists or forced to attend a \u201cdiversity, equity and inclusion\u201d brainwashing course.) As a Baby Boomer born precisely at the midpoint of the 20th century, I\u2019m aware that my productive years are passing quickly. I\u2019d like to get another book or two into print while my mind is still reasonably robust, and I\u2019ll be content to leave the political punditry to the younger folks with an appetite for constant bickering. I\u2019ll still be observing the American scene, but I won\u2019t feel obligated to share my opinions with the world (or at least the few hundred followers I had amassed during the past fifteen years). Of course, if any bloviating bully on the MAGA right or woke left goes overboard, I\u2019ll be tempted to fire a salvo in their direction. You should, too. Coincidence\u2026 Or intelligent design?The very day I sat down to write my final column, hunting and pecking on my iPad\u2019s virtual keyboard, former Democrat and political gadfly Andrew Yang announced the formation of a major third (and centrist) party, via the merger of his own Forward Party with the Renew America Movement and the Serve America Movement. The new party would preserve the name of Yang\u2019s organization (would members be known as Forwardists?). They\u2019d launch a \u201cnational building tour\u201d this fall and plan to hold their first convention next summer with the hope of getting national candidates onto the ballot in nearly every state by 2024. Yang and former New Jersey governor Christine Todd Whitman, a Republican environmentalist (apparently not an oxymoron) who defected from the GOP, will co-chair the new party. Along with David Jolly, another ex-Republican, they wrote in a recentWashington Postop-ed that \u201cpolitical extremism is ripping our nation apart, and the two major parties have failed to remedy the crisis.\u201d They added this cogent point: \u201cToday\u2019s outdated parties have failed by catering to the fringes. As a result, most Americans feel they aren\u2019t represented.\u201d In an interview with CNN, Yang noted that \u201c62% of Americans now want a third party, a record high.\u201d Whitman added that \u201cthe majority of Americans actually agree on\u2026 divisive issues of the day like abortion or firearms \u2014 there\u2019s actually a common sense coalition position on these issues and just about every other issue under the sun.\u201d That\u2019s pretty much what I\u2019ve been shouting from my rooftop for the past fifteen years, so I\u2019m pleased that someone with a louder voice will be doing the shouting now. Of course, we also need to remember that no new party has entrenched itself permanently as a force in US politics since the Republicans burst onto the scene in 1854. That\u2019s a long dry spell, and it\u2019s time we had a bold new player in the game. Any party committed to combatting polarization in our politics and culture has my vote. Let\u2019s hope it can generate another hundred million votes from America\u2019s mostly silent moderate majority. Farewell, good luck, and stay centered! * *. * * . * Note: Although I won\u2019t be writing new columns for The New Moderate, the site will remain up and running. I\u2019ll occasionally be updating features like our Hall of Fame and Hit List. I might even write a few new three-way arguments in the Issues section.

It\u2019s not as if any of us changed our core beliefs, but I think that all of us, at one time or another, came around to understanding the legitimacy of arguments that perhaps didn\u2019t fit our pre-existing biases.But, it\u2019s time to move on.

It\u2019s written entirely in archaic English, purportedly by one of his loyal friends, and is presented as a factual biography \u2014 although of course it\u2019s all a bit surrealistic.I had started this story in my 30s and left it half-finished \u2014 because who on earth would buy a story about an English-speaking dodo, written in 18th-century style prose?

You\u2019ve been very influential on my thinking, as have Ron, Dave,Savannah, and others.) It has occured to me that, had I not had Rick or the rest of the TNM crew to debate with, I would still have a somewhat limited, less balanced (to the extent that it is balanced!), and more one-sided view of the world of politics. It\u2019s not as if any of us changed our core beliefs, but I think that all of us, at one time or another, came around to understanding the legitimacy of arguments that perhaps didn\u2019t fit our pre-existing biases. But, it\u2019s time to move on. To say that \u201ctimes have changed\u201d would be an understatement. I look forward to Rick\u2019s next project, and. whether or not it involves the social and political universe, I am confident it will be worth my attention. Rick BayanpermalinkJuly 31, 2022 10:40 pmThanks, Priscilla. You\u2019ve been here from the start, and I\u2019ve always valued your intelligent input even when we didn\u2019t agree (which actually wasn\u2019t all that often). As you said, we might not have changed our core beliefs, but maybe we\u2019ve come to respect a variety of viewpoints (except for those on the far left and far right, of course).My current project is literally an odd bird \u2014 the far-fetched tale of Jeremy Dodo, the last of his species, an articulate fowl who finds his way to England in the early 18th century and becomes a minor celebrity until he runs afoul of the establishment. It\u2019s written entirely in archaic English, purportedly by one of his loyal friends, and is presented as a factual biography \u2014 although of course it\u2019s all a bit surrealistic.I had started this story in my 30s and left it half-finished \u2014 because who on earth would buy a story about an English-speaking dodo, written in 18th-century style prose? (I feel the same way today, but the old bird called out to me and I couldn\u2019t leave him in limbo.)Reply Thanks, Priscilla.

RobypermalinkAugust 2, 2022 1:01 pmHi Rick and everyone,Thank you Rick for all your good moderate energy and intentions. We all have profited from your efforts and talents. The much wider circle of silent readers and subscribers tells the real story of your impact. Those of us verbose regulars who talked out heads off over the years were just the tip of the iceberg.Thanks for asking Priscilla, things are fine with me and mine, my wife\u2019s niece is now living with us, from Ukraine by way of Poland by way of United for Ukraine, which is credited to Joe Biden in the news. I now have a two Ukrainian power gardening team on my property. Borscht by the gallon. I hope all is well with everyone here.I have not commented lately because all I care about is Russia\u2019s fascist dictator and fascist invasion. Nothing else is much on my mind. Blathering on and on about politics seems fruitless to me, I try to keep my own world on an even keel and appreciate the good things. There is only so much I can say here about Putin\u2019s war and enthronement as tsar, history was moving very fast in February and March, the pace has slowed sown and it will take years now to know how this comes out. Russia is full of good people and good things, but its social pattern is some form of police state with a tsar and his corrupt retinue. That is probably their future, forever. They will always need to be contained, like a disease. A disease with 4000 nuclear warheads that they can\u2019t use without being exterminated themselves. It will be the most eventful question in the world in the next years whether things will turn out so utterly bad for them that they are forced to change the nature of their fascist shithole of a motherland.So, that is what is on my mind and I cannot predict, and no one can predict the future.Vast impersonal amoral forces shape the future and it only ever will seem to be a logical story decades after it happens. Looking at history it seems to make sense, the story seems to have a direction and a plot. Looking at the future is totally different, it\u2019s unknown.Looking at history it seems that things usually move slowly in the direction of an improvement despite all the horrors of conflicts. We may very well survive all the turmoil and our descendents may well live is a world that is livable and enjoyable for most in spite of the bad people and bad events.ReplyRick BayanpermalinkAugust 5, 2022 12:04 amRoby: Thanks for your kind words; I\u2019ve always valued your opinions here.

Glad you returned for my valedictory post, which seems to have generated fewer comments than any of my posts to date. (Wow, it\u2019s as if only four people showed up for my funeral.) Anyway, I hope I\u2019ve provoked, reassured and entertained all those silent readers over the years. I feel a little more positive about retiring my blog now that a moderate third party has entered the scene. I totally understand your current preoccupation with the war and atrocities in Ukraine, and good on you for getting involved as much as you have. I\u2019d still like to see a cabal of Russian insiders remove Putin from office, dead or alive. I doubt if the Russian despot will retreat from his pet project as long as he\u2019s in power. He needs to go. robypermalinkAugust 5, 2022 11:08 amRick, the \u201ccrew\u201d who have posted our mini (or not so mini) commentaries in response to yours all have I am sure the same fondness for your writing and sadness to see the end of this.
