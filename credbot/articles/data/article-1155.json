Start here Model-Observation Comparisons Miscellaneous Climate Graphics Surface temperature graphics **Andean glaciers have shrunk more than ever before in the entire Holocene** 19 Mar 2025byStefan Glaciers are important indicators of climate change. Arecent studypublished in the leading journalScienceshows that glaciers in the tropical Andes have now retreated further than at any other time in the entire Holocene \u2013 which covers the whole history of human civilisation since the invention of agriculture. These findings are likely to resonate beyond the scientific community, as they strongly support the lawsuit filed by a Peruvian farmer against the energy company RWE, which has returned to court this week.Paleoclimatologists can determine how long bedrock beneath a glacier has been covered by ice using measurements of specific isotopes. When rock surfaces are exposed, isotopes such as carbon-14 and beryllium-10 form due to bombardment by cosmic radiation. If, however, the rock is covered by an ice sheet, it is shielded from this radiation, and these unstable isotopes gradually disappear through radioactive decay (with half-lives of 5,700 and 1.4 million years, respectively). This method, known as cosmogenic radionuclide dating, has beenwell-establishedfor decades. I first encountered it myself 23 years ago during anexcursionwith glacier experts to New Zealand\u2019s Southern Alps. The new study applied this method to examine several glaciers in the tropical Andes (see Fig. 1). In rock samples collected at the edges of the glaciers, researchers found isotope concentrations close to zero. From this, they conclude that these rocks must have remained covered by ice throughout the entire Holocene, shielding them from cosmic radiation. This indicates that these glaciers are very likely smaller today than at any point in at least the last 11,700 years. This finding aligns with several previous studies showing that temperatures in the tropical Andes have never been warmer during the Holocene than they are today. For instance, reconstructions of the glacier margin of the Quelccaya Ice Cap demonstrate that it has not been smaller than today at any time in at least thelast 7,000 years. Temperature reconstructions based on proxy data further support this conclusion. **Global Warming Means Global Glacier Retreat** The Andes are not an exception: according to current research, global average temperatures today are very likely higher than at any other point duringthe entire Holocene. Given that an ice age lasted for more than 100,000 years before the Holocene, today\u2019s temperatures are probably the highest experienced in about 120,000 years. This unprecedented warming, which began in the 19th century and has so far reached around1.3\u20131.4\u00b0C, is almost entirely driven by human activity \u2013 primarily the burning of fossil fuels. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), natural factors have contributed very little to recent warming, probably even having a slightly cooling effect, due todeclining solar activitysince the mid-20th century (a fact reflected in the title of former RWE manager FritzVahrenholt\u2019s book,Die kalte Sonne\u2013The Cold Sun). As a result, glaciers worldwide continue tolose mass(see Figure 2). In Germany, only four glaciers remain, following the disappearance of the Southern Schneeferner glacier in September 2022. Soon, there will be no glaciers left in Germany at all. Implications for the RWE Case The RWE case addresses, among other things, whether global warming caused by CO\u2082 emissions is responsible for the severe glacier melt, the substantial retreat of the glacier by approximately 1.5 km over the past 140 years and the thawing of permafrost above the city of Huaraz in Peru. A 2021attribution studypublished in the respected journalNature Geosciencehas already conclusively demonstrated this connection; however, RWE appears to continue challenging these findings. In this context, the new data from Gorin et al. are particularly relevant. The Queshque Glacier, now smaller than at any other time in at least the last 11,700 years, is located only 40 km from Huaraz, in the same mountain range as Lake Palcacocha (see Fig. 3). It is highly likely that local climate changes across this area differ minimally at most. Although average climate conditions can vary over short distances due to local topography, climatewarmingtypically has a correlation radius of more than 1,000 km. Therefore, there is no meaningful difference in climate change effects between Queshque Glacier and Lake Palcacocha. This region is already experiencing the most significant climate warming in the history of human civilisation. It will undoubtedly continue until the global economy achieves climate neutrality, essentially,net-zero CO\u2082 emissions. In the RWE trial, the central issue will be whether, and to what extent, the city of Huaraz and the plaintiff would be affected by a glacier flood. A systematic analysis of past glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) in the region has examined 160 such events based on satellite imagery. The findings clearly identify the Andes around Huaraz as a hotspot for this risk (see Fig. 4). Additionally, this study shows that the frequency of such floods has increased significantly since 1980 (see Fig. 5). Before 1980, there was only one year with more than two recorded GLOFs: 1970 due to a severe earthquake. However, there are now repeatedly years with 3, 4 or even 5 glacial lake outbursts. One thing is clear: given the existing research, it would be absurd to assume that the risk of a Lake Palcacocha outburst could be calculated based solely on historical data, without explicitly accounting for global warming caused by fossil fuels. Anyone who suggests that climate change is not happening in Huaraz \u2013 that there is no human fingerprint, and therefore no connection to RWE\u2019s share of CO\u2082 emissions \u2013 may have their reasons for doing so. But the evidence clearly shows otherwise.

Poor Perusays19 Mar 2025 at 9:20 PMIncredible how utterly misguided and na\u00efve even intelligent climate scientists still can be. As if RWE has anything significant to do with any glaciers melting anywhere, or specifically in Peru. It\u2019s called global warming for a reason. Why not sue the East India Company, Great Britain, China, the USA, Russia, all the western nations who brought you the industrial revolution including NASA?This kind of approach is ludicrous, no wonder you lose the arguments and the COPs do nothing. Surely Stefan you need a lawsuit against James Watt\u2019s descendants and anyone who has ever held a share in a coal mine anywhere on earth ever?[Response:Let\u2019s ignore your first sentence, I just report on science here and have nothing to do with this or any other court case.RWE is the biggest CO2 emitter in Europe and the lawsuit only aims to hold them responsible for their share of global emissions. And you are correct, many others could be held responsible for their shares \u2013 so far there has been nearly 3000 climate litigation cases:https://earth.org/explainer-climate-litigation-trends-and-impact/. No doubt there will be more to come. -stefan]Dansays20 Mar 2025 at 4:20 AMOh brother, talk about naive:. Clue for you: The source of the greenhouse gasses which contribute to glacier loss is greenhouse gas emissions from sources such as RWE. This is not rocket science.Rory Allensays20 Mar 2025 at 8:06 AMI take your point, but the same logic would imply that one should not pursue Germans responsible for killing individual Jews, for example, on the grounds that the murder of a dozen people did not \u2018have anything significant\u2019 to do with the slaughter of six million.The reason why people are pursuing individual companies, I suspect, is precisely that \u2018the COPs do nothing\u2019, and there are very few alternatives left, of which one is the legal challenge to fossil fuel companies.It would certainly be more logical to sue Exxon-Mobil, which has emitted far more CO2 in its lifetime. You will probably find that they, together with Shell and BP added together, have contributed the majority of the rise in CO2 levels, certainly much more than was added during the 19th century by the steam engines of James Watt.Thiemo Kellnersays28 Mar 2025 at 1:04 PMI am not sure where your numbers come from, stating that the oil and energy companies cited have a share of more than 50 % together. I rather suspect, you mix up the companies with the buyers of their goods and services. Sure, it is much easier to finger point at single companies than to hold the whole population responsible for their actions. I am not aware of a single case of pressing people to buy and burn their fossil products. Trying to make responsible single companies for the actions of their customers just makes environmentally no sense because it makes people think \u201coh good, it is not my action that is causing harm\u201d while on the flight to their next holiday destination.Barton Paul Levensonsays29 Mar 2025 at 8:15 AMTK: I am not aware of a single case of pressing people to buy and burn their fossil products.BPL: Advertising?

If the former, then PP will find little sympathy here; if the latter, then take it easy, PP! Stefan is not an author of theScienceorNature Geosciencearticles he cites. He is commenting on the scientific evidence relevant to the RWE lawsuit, which was initiated by a countryman of yours. The plaintiff alleges that RWE is responsible only for 0.5% of global fossil carbon emissions to date, a plausible figure AFAICT (https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/peruvian-farmer-takes-german-energy-giant-rwe-court-landmark-climate-case-2025-03-16). No one is insulting you personally, nor is Stefan blaming the nation of Peru disproportionately for global warming!As for Stefan needing to sue everyone who\u2019s ever burned, or caused to be burned, any amount of fossil carbon: you understand, don\u2019t you, that Stefan didn\u2019t write the published reports, and isn\u2019t suing anybody? Yet you\u2019ve apparently failed to grasp the Tragedy of the Commons: a term of Economics art, and one reason why Economics is called \u201cthe dismal science\u201d. Global warming is the result of the \u201cfree\u201d market\u2019s ancient propensity to socialize every transaction cost it can get away with. Onlycollectivemarket intervention can limit socialized costs, in this case by driving the energy market toward renewables.Collective measures may include per-tonne fees or taxes on producers, incentives for renewable energy development, and regulations on emissions. The primary obstacle to collective mitigation of anthropogenic global warming is resistance by fossil fuel producers and investors, whose $trillions in annual profits have so far thwarted almost all collective intervention! But anything that reduces net profits to producers drives capital away from them; litigation under existing laws is being tried in the USA (https://lawclimateatlas.org/resources/climate-change-litigation-in-the-us), with mixed results. Suing individual consumers of fossil fuels and all goods and services made with them, is of course ridiculous. Collective action to take the profit out of selling fossil fuels is not: in fact, it is urgent wherever you live!Tom\u00e1\u0161 Kaliszsays23 Mar 2025 at 9:44 PMIn Re to MalAdapted, 20 MAR 2025 AT 12:22 PM,https://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2025/03/andean-glaciers-have-shrunk-more-than-ever-before-in-the-holocene/#comment-831328Dear Sir,I agree that the article cited by Dr. Rahmstorf does convincingly show an evidence that global warming in the industrial era is the cause of Andean glacier shrinkage during this era.On the other hand, I doubt that it is sufficiently clear in what extent the emissions produced by the company RWE contributed to the observed melting of a specific glacier, so that a court could sentence the company for damages caused thereby. If I was the RWE counsel, I would certainly suggest the articlehttps://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/adb7f2cited by you a few days agohttps://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2025/03/unforced-variations-mar-2025/#comment-831238as an evidence that rather cattle ranchers should be sued for these damages instead of RWE.GreetingsTom\u00e1\u0161Nigeljsays20 Mar 2025 at 4:52 PMPoor Peru: \u201cWhy not sue the East India Company, Great Britain, China, the USA, Russia, all the western nations who brought you the industrial revolution including NASA?\u2026This kind of approach is ludicrous, no wonder you lose the arguments \u201dCompletely unfair statement. I don\u2019t recall Stefan actually endorsing lawsuits against fossil fuels companies for their emissions. The only material in the commentary related to RWE was related to scientific issues around emissions, warming and glacier loss. In no way can that be read as an endorsement of the case. However I do agree that suing fossil fuels companies for emissions doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense. Quite happy to see them sued though, when they lie about the climate issue.Poor Perusays28 Mar 2025 at 7:33 PMDear Stefan,I thank you for your response. My apologies for the offense caused by my beginning characterizations for this is how it honestly appears to me.Stefan, I humbly suggest you went far beyond\u201cjust report the science here.\u201dbecause you introduced this specifically-\u201cThese findings are likely to resonatebeyondthe scientific community, as they strongly support the lawsuit filed by a Peruvian farmer against the energy company RWE, which has returned to court this week.\u201dI am suggesting this inclusion of RWE and court cases weakens, confuses and distorts whatever scientific finding and message you intended to convey.Your reference says\u201ccontained 2,796 cases \u2013 1,850 filed in the US\u201dand not 3000. A 70 per year average. No where can I find where it tells us how many cases have been won since 1986. We know it is miniscule though. If US litigation habits were effective the whole world would be doing it just like they do. We, the ROW, do not for obvious reasons.Lastly Stefan, you say above\u201cyou are correct, many others could be held responsible for their shares\u201d.My view is anyone buying electricity from RWE should be held responsible if this lawfare approach had any credibility or effectiveness at holdingbad actorsto account. I put it to you it does not.In a broader sense every citizen of Europe yourself and your ancestors included going back centuries should be held accountable for the \u201cfossil fuel pollution\u201d using your national Governments as Proxy defendants. Of course this is absurd. Which was my original point. Everyone should know by now the biggest historical culprit is the USA. Why not sue them?All attempts to bring lawsuits against companies like RWE and their shareholders for being somehowmore responsiblethan everyone else is collectively is a fallacy. Or you would call for NASA, NOAA, and CopernicusECMWF @CopernicusEU to be sued as well.Because everything that exists today has been founded upon historical fossil fuel energy supply and it\u2019s CO2 pollution.Including NPPs, solar and wind energy to housing and food production and retail shops and the internet you use to distribute your scientific materials.My advice is to be realistic. Pray for a miracle.Best wishes.Kevin McKinneysays29 Mar 2025 at 6:11 PM\u201cAll attempts to bring lawsuits against companies like RWE and their shareholders for being somehow more responsible than everyone else is collectively is a fallacy.\u201dExcept that\u2019s not what is being done.

If the former, then PP will find little sympathy here; if the latter, then take it easy, PP! Stefan is not an author of theScienceorNature Geosciencearticles he cites.

The primary obstacle to collective mitigation of anthropogenic global warming is resistance by fossil fuel producers and investors, whose $trillions in annual profits have so far thwarted almost all collective intervention! But anything that reduces net profits to producers drives capital away from them; litigation under existing laws is being tried in the USA (https://lawclimateatlas.org/resources/climate-change-litigation-in-the-us), with mixed results.

If US litigation habits were effective the whole world would be doing it just like they do. We, the ROW, do not for obvious reasons.Lastly Stefan, you say above\u201cyou are correct, many others could be held responsible for their shares\u201d.My view is anyone buying electricity from RWE should be held responsible if this lawfare approach had any credibility or effectiveness at holdingbad actorsto account. I put it to you it does not.In a broader sense every citizen of Europe yourself and your ancestors included going back centuries should be held accountable for the \u201cfossil fuel pollution\u201d using your national Governments as Proxy defendants.

Why not sue them?All attempts to bring lawsuits against companies like RWE and their shareholders for being somehowmore responsiblethan everyone else is collectively is a fallacy.

Rory Allensays 20 Mar 2025 at 8:06 AM I take your point, but the same logic would imply that one should not pursue Germans responsible for killing individual Jews, for example, on the grounds that the murder of a dozen people did not \u2018have anything significant\u2019 to do with the slaughter of six million. The reason why people are pursuing individual companies, I suspect, is precisely that \u2018the COPs do nothing\u2019, and there are very few alternatives left, of which one is the legal challenge to fossil fuel companies. It would certainly be more logical to sue Exxon-Mobil, which has emitted far more CO2 in its lifetime. You will probably find that they, together with Shell and BP added together, have contributed the majority of the rise in CO2 levels, certainly much more than was added during the 19th century by the steam engines of James Watt.

The primary obstacle to collective mitigation of anthropogenic global warming is resistance by fossil fuel producers and investors, whose $trillions in annual profits have so far thwarted almost all collective intervention! But anything that reduces net profits to producers drives capital away from them; litigation under existing laws is being tried in the USA (https://lawclimateatlas.org/resources/climate-change-litigation-in-the-us), with mixed results.

Stefan, I humbly suggest you went far beyond\u201cjust report the science here.\u201dbecause you introduced this specifically-\u201cThese findings are likely to resonatebeyondthe scientific community, as they strongly support the lawsuit filed by a Peruvian farmer against the energy company RWE, which has returned to court this week.\u201d I am suggesting this inclusion of RWE and court cases weakens, confuses and distorts whatever scientific finding and message you intended to convey. Your reference says\u201ccontained 2,796 cases \u2013 1,850 filed in the US\u201dand not 3000. A 70 per year average. No where can I find where it tells us how many cases have been won since 1986. We know it is miniscule though. If US litigation habits were effective the whole world would be doing it just like they do. We, the ROW, do not for obvious reasons. Lastly Stefan, you say above\u201cyou are correct, many others could be held responsible for their shares\u201d.My view is anyone buying electricity from RWE should be held responsible if this lawfare approach had any credibility or effectiveness at holdingbad actorsto account. I put it to you it does not. In a broader sense every citizen of Europe yourself and your ancestors included going back centuries should be held accountable for the \u201cfossil fuel pollution\u201d using your national Governments as Proxy defendants. Of course this is absurd. Which was my original point. Everyone should know by now the biggest historical culprit is the USA. Why not sue them? All attempts to bring lawsuits against companies like RWE and their shareholders for being somehowmore responsiblethan everyone else is collectively is a fallacy. Or you would call for NASA, NOAA, and CopernicusECMWF @CopernicusEU to be sued as well.Because everything that exists today has been founded upon historical fossil fuel energy supply and it\u2019s CO2 pollution.Including NPPs, solar and wind energy to housing and food production and retail shops and the internet you use to distribute your scientific materials. My advice is to be realistic. Pray for a miracle.Best wishes.

JCMsays20 Mar 2025 at 7:53 AM\u201c\u201d\u201dit would be absurd to assume that the risk of a Lake Palcacocha outburst could be calculated based solely on historical data, without explicitly accounting for global warming caused by fossil fuels\u201d\u201d\u201dBased on the article provided by Secular Animisthttps://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2025/03/unforced-variations-mar-2025/#comment-831238\u2013Isn\u2019t the idea that, through the current calibrated global warming schemes and nebulous feedback factors, Fossil Fuel emission is currently responsible for only 18% of effective radiative forcing, and land use emission to have caused 60% (32%-87%)?https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/adb7f2\u201cWe compare these results with conventional accounting and find that this approach boosts perceived carbon emissions from deforestation, and finds agriculture, the most extensive land user, to be the leading emissions sector and to have caused 60% (32%\u201387%) of ERF change since 1750. We also find that fossil fuels are responsible for 18% of ERF, a reduced contribution due to masking from cooling co-emissions\u201dThis isn\u2019t to downplay opposition to fossil-fueled development, but it\u2019s striking how the cumulative emissions and net radiative forcing from land management far exceed those from fossil fuels. This estimate also doesn\u2019t account for the destruction of biologically mediated precipitation regulation, such as the loss of pollen, bacteria, and fungi, which plays a significant role in atmospheric dynamics.In various forums, the ecological destruction commencing for real in 20th century is actively minimized in the current campaign for climate protection, in spite of obvious significant indicators such as 73% of wildlife populations perishing since 1970https://findingnature.org.uk/2024/10/10/visualising-the-crisis-of-biodiversity-loss/, and the previously mentioned overwhelming contribution of landscape management to net forcing.any insights into this obvious and potentially damaging bias is appreciated.b fagansays23 Mar 2025 at 9:09 PMHi JCM. I\u2019m not familiar with large-scale climate messaging from a \u201creduce fossil use rapidly\u201d standpoint that fails to include benefits to the biosphere due to less pollution, less land disturbance, less water demand, etc. So you might perceive \u201cactively minimized\u201d emphasis, but I\u2019ve not. Most of the time when I see advocacy to halt warming the planet, they\u2019re not saying things like: \u201cbut use more land to graze cattle before fattening them\u201d, for example, or suggesting wind farms shouldn\u2019t be sited and operated with the idea of minimizing harm to birds and bats.Regarding the single-author study you mention (the quote using the royal \u201cwe\u201d) I\u2019d really want to see others analyze his novel economic view rigorously before accepting results, especially since he notes some of the detail he includes is \u2018indicative\u2019 due to large assumptions or lack of data precision.Another point I\u2019m not sure he is properly accounting for is his massive discounting of the impacts of fossil fuels as a forcing due to cooling from their aerosols. His figure 1 appears to show that warming from fossil fuel CO2 is pretty much completely negated by accompanying aerosols. It looks very much like it doesn\u2019t take into account that persistence means some of the CO2 from a lump of 1950 bitumen is still trapping heat today, 73 years or so after the accompanying aerosol dose fell as acid rain. Has he also accounted for the fact that the West, then China, have been addressing the aerosols with pollution controls and scrubbers before they were beginning to switch from burning fossil? Fossil burning is cleaner now, and also still, unfortunately, breaking records every year. There\u2019s also fugitive emissions of methane from wells, pipelines and old coal mines which wouldn\u2019t happen but for fossil fuel extraction.Does your author cover the fact that some areas cleared for agriculture are forest again?And does he cover the fact that reforestation also can affect albedo such that the carbon uptake might not outweigh the change in albedo? Nature Communications has a 2024 paper going over that: \u201cAccounting for albedo change to identify climate-positive tree cover restoration\u201d that shows that we need to be thoughtful about reforesting, and there are other papers out there that show restoring deep native grasslands might be more the plan in many areas (including where aridification is changing where trees might still do well).https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-46577-1JCMsays25 Mar 2025 at 8:57 AMWhenever we hear professional climate communicators claim that an event is primarily due to fossil fuel burning, or some similarly exaggerated framing, we should recognize that such statements are not based on the best available evidence \u2013 be it conventional accounting schemes (47% FF burning) or novel method (18% FF burning). Instead, they represent a distortion of both science and academic publishing.This trend is causing serious reputational harm to the field by legitimizing the introduction of misleading claims into legal proceedings. Half-truths are, in essence, total lies. It seems that the normalization of half-truths has become so widespread that even respected scientists have lost sight of the fact that they are engaging in deception, perhaps under the belief that the ends justify the means.I think it\u2019s completely obvious how public facing climate science communication and associated finance is 100% focused on fossil fuel elimination, which is a noble pursuit. However, in the process of leveraging legitimate science as a tool for political persuasion, the reliance on oversimplified narratives is seriously damaging perception of the field\u2019s credibility. Alarmingly, this has created a dynamic where conservation practitioners and climate protection allies like myself are treated as adversaries if we don\u2019t fully subscribe to and fixate on the dominant narrative \u2013 though this attitude is largely confined to online climate enthusiasts rather than qualified professionals IRL.Barton Paul Levensonsays26 Mar 2025 at 11:41 AMJCM: Whenever we hear professional climate communicators claim that an event is primarily due to fossil fuel burning, or some similarly exaggerated framing, we should recognize that such statements are not based on the best available evidenceBPL: Whenever we hear JCM say something like this, we should recognize that such statements are not based on any available evidence at all.b fagansays26 Mar 2025 at 12:08 PM@JCM \u2013 I asked some questions about this one guy\u2019s paper and the broadness of its claim and some possible holes in his logic. Instead of addressing those you accuse me of being mean?And again, your comments like \u201cI think it\u2019s completely obvious how public facing climate science communication and associated finance is 100% focused on fossil fuel elimination, which is a noble pursuit..\u201d may be completely obvious to you, but when I see discussions of dealing with sources of warming, the agricultural methane production from ruminants and rice is very commonly part of the overall set of things to manage. Read about efforts to improve yields of rice without flooding paddies, or food additives to reduce methane in cattle.Please provide some published science that would back up the equivalence of heating and cooling for burning of a unit of fossil fuel that would leave the two effects equal, despite the observed reality that warming CO2 persists in the atmosphere far far longer than the cooling aerosols from the same source fossil fuel burn. Also, please address the same topic but account for the decrease in aerosols produced as nations implement more and more pollution controls while still burning carbon fuels. If you believe the warming/cooling ratios of emissions from a modern supercritical coal plant in the US is the same as the first coal plants in 1800s UK or mid-last-century China, I\u2019d really like to see your evidence, since that was a big part of the paper you brought to this forum.Seriously \u2013 science is about asking \u201cwhere\u2019s your evidence\u201d when a claim is made. The typical helpful scientific response is not to go into a defensive crouch and argue \u201cconservative\u201d is being picked on, if by \u201cconservative\u201d you are talking about people who, currently, are casting about for novel ways to avoid the conclusion that fossil fuels are producing the bulk of warming this century and the second half of the previous century.So where\u2019s your evidence?JCMsays27 Mar 2025 at 1:35 PMFair enough. My interest was in the extreme bias in perception created in the climate space. It is not my modus operandi to tear apart a paper \u2013 your ideas seem just fine. I\u2019m sure someone would be eager to count emissions with you in this context. Maybe they will chime in on your specific interests.Regardless whether it\u2019s the controversial 18% or the conventional 47%, it makes no difference.

I think we see aspects of the carnage already on full display right on this very thread.I noticed your cattle and rice ideas; such as providing food additives, or avoid flooding, which is nice thinking. At the same time, it seems to be completely unserious and disproportionate in perspective about the real scale of environmental destruction ongoing, and how this relates directly to the changes outside to date. This disconnected and disproportionate framing is embedded deep into all aspects of how the issue is communicated.

How will be the attribution made for a forcing that does not work directly (or has only a quite weak direct warming or cooling effect on global climate), however, it strongly changes climate sensitivity to other forcings?If you could provide explanations and/or some references clarifying these questions, I will highly appreciate your help.Best regardsTom\u00e1\u0161Barton Paul Levensonsays28 Mar 2025 at 8:13 AMJCM: We all know the standard line: \u201cthe climate has already been warmed by 1.3C due primarily to the burning of fossil fuels\u201d \u2122.

Nor the author of the proposal for a \u201cnovel accounting\u201d of the warming effects that is JCM\u2019s newest reference darling.b fagan: \u201cdespite the observed reality that warming CO2 persists in the atmosphere far far longer than the cooling aerosols from the same source fossil fuel burn.\u201dYeah \u2013 to quantify the scale of manipulation here \u2013 let\u2019s look at the residence times of both:\u2013 aerosols are Cloud Condensation Nuclei (CCNs) \u2013 so most of them would be washed out of the troposphere with rain they help to create \u2013 i.e. order of magnitude of the residence time of water vapour in air (i.e. ca.: ONE WEEK).\u2013 in contrast \u2013 the surplus CO2 takes MANY DECADES, some of it \u2013 centuries/millennia, to clear out of the air.To make it better, we have a double standard: JCM and/or his author:\u2013 uses the cooling by short-residence time FF aerosols to reduce the importnace of the warming by the long-residence time FF CO2\u2013 while ignoring the coolling by the increase in land albedo due land use change (forest albedo is considerably smaller than that of corplands, pastures, bare soil, or a desert) EVEN THOUGH this increase in albedo, unlike FF aerosols, does not last a week, but is PERMANENT \u2013 i.e. will continue cooling even AFTER most of the surplus CO2 released by deforestation has been already cleared out from the atmosphere.In other words \u2013 JCM is seeing an albedo straw in the eye of the other, and ignores the beam permanently embeded in his own.But for JCM \u2013 just the recongnition of the role of GHGs at all \u2013 is still a progress, brought on by the new paper with \u201cnovel accounting\u201d of the role of non-FF GHGs. A progress, because just a few months back he would have none of it \u2013 attacking the credibility of the climate modelling for the \u201cartificial fixation and overemphasis on the outputs oftrace gas[Co2 \u2013 P.]\u201dSo under the influence of the \u201cnovel accounting\u201d paper, our JCM evolved from the \u201canything but the Co2\u201d denier to the \u201canything but FFs\u201d denier.And who said that \u201cpeople don\u2019t change\u201d? ;-)JCMsays29 Mar 2025 at 5:55 PMYes yes I know. The various distortions here are a symptom of something quite insidious. The examples are accumulating.Nevertheless, academic style contributions from conservationists such as Wedderburn-Bisshop in the framework of emission counting offers a useful reminder.Underpinning the message is the carbon opportunity cost, which aligns directly as a proxy: We are all on the hook for profound ecological dysfunction. Billions and billions of hectares rendered to rockflour, disappearance of species, and erosion of the essential regulatory functions of the planet. This has critically weakened the natural buffers that sustained stability for millennia. I think it\u2019s not controversial.Emission counting is just one of many possible approaches to conservation. The role of aerosol co-emissions is already well established, yet it\u2019s striking how many seem oblivious. I can\u2019t imagine why this is the point of contention. In any case, it should be obvious how climate falls under the umbrella of Earth system science; not that Earth science falls under a scheme fixated with FF emission.I welcome ideas to jolt people into awareness of environmental conservation, numerous co-benefits, and the direct connection to changes outside, from any perspective.Susan Andersonsays29 Mar 2025 at 6:48 PManyone paying attention:B Fagan is one of the finest communicators around. He doesn\u2019t clutter this comment section, but he is always worth a careful read or listen.Please.Piotrsays23 Mar 2025 at 11:38 PMThere is a death, taxes and \u2026JCM downplaying the need to dramatically reduce the use of fossil fuels.Particularly when he assures as:JCM \u201cThis isn\u2019t to downplay opposition to fossil-fueled development, butonly to downplay them after the but:JCM:, but it\u2019s striking how the cumulative emissions and net radiative forcing from land management FAR EXCEED those from fossil fuels.BTW \u2013 these \u201cfar exceeding\u201d is not based on IPCC, but on \u2026 somebody proposing \u2026 a \u201cnovel\u201d accounting \u2013 in which radiative forcing of the land use changes is NO LONGER calculated from the EXTRA GHGs staying in the atmosphere, but from \u2026.cumulative gross land emissions of GHGs since 1750WITHOUT accounting for the cumulative uptake of the same since 1750. And ignoring the negative forcing from the albedo that increases severalfold following deforestation, right?So I prefer your original honesty, without the current pretense of how you don\u2019t intend to downplay the need to reduce the fossil fuel emissions, you know something like the good ol JCM, circa December, bemoaning the climate modelling for its: \u201cartificial fixation and overemphasis on the outputs of trace gas [Co2 \u2013 P.]\u201d.To borrow from Gary OldmanNever be ashamed of what you are.. JCMsays 20 Mar 2025 at 7:53 AM \u201c\u201d\u201dit would be absurd to assume that the risk of a Lake Palcacocha outburst could be calculated based solely on historical data, without explicitly accounting for global warming caused by fossil fuels\u201d\u201d\u201d Based on the article provided by Secular Animisthttps://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2025/03/unforced-variations-mar-2025/#comment-831238\u2013 Isn\u2019t the idea that, through the current calibrated global warming schemes and nebulous feedback factors, Fossil Fuel emission is currently responsible for only 18% of effective radiative forcing, and land use emission to have caused 60% (32%-87%)? https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/adb7f2 \u201cWe compare these results with conventional accounting and find that this approach boosts perceived carbon emissions from deforestation, and finds agriculture, the most extensive land user, to be the leading emissions sector and to have caused 60% (32%\u201387%) of ERF change since 1750. We also find that fossil fuels are responsible for 18% of ERF, a reduced contribution due to masking from cooling co-emissions\u201d This isn\u2019t to downplay opposition to fossil-fueled development, but it\u2019s striking how the cumulative emissions and net radiative forcing from land management far exceed those from fossil fuels. This estimate also doesn\u2019t account for the destruction of biologically mediated precipitation regulation, such as the loss of pollen, bacteria, and fungi, which plays a significant role in atmospheric dynamics. In various forums, the ecological destruction commencing for real in 20th century is actively minimized in the current campaign for climate protection, in spite of obvious significant indicators such as 73% of wildlife populations perishing since 1970https://findingnature.org.uk/2024/10/10/visualising-the-crisis-of-biodiversity-loss/, and the previously mentioned overwhelming contribution of landscape management to net forcing. any insights into this obvious and potentially damaging bias is appreciated. b fagansays23 Mar 2025 at 9:09 PMHi JCM. I\u2019m not familiar with large-scale climate messaging from a \u201creduce fossil use rapidly\u201d standpoint that fails to include benefits to the biosphere due to less pollution, less land disturbance, less water demand, etc. So you might perceive \u201cactively minimized\u201d emphasis, but I\u2019ve not. Most of the time when I see advocacy to halt warming the planet, they\u2019re not saying things like: \u201cbut use more land to graze cattle before fattening them\u201d, for example, or suggesting wind farms shouldn\u2019t be sited and operated with the idea of minimizing harm to birds and bats.Regarding the single-author study you mention (the quote using the royal \u201cwe\u201d) I\u2019d really want to see others analyze his novel economic view rigorously before accepting results, especially since he notes some of the detail he includes is \u2018indicative\u2019 due to large assumptions or lack of data precision.Another point I\u2019m not sure he is properly accounting for is his massive discounting of the impacts of fossil fuels as a forcing due to cooling from their aerosols. His figure 1 appears to show that warming from fossil fuel CO2 is pretty much completely negated by accompanying aerosols. It looks very much like it doesn\u2019t take into account that persistence means some of the CO2 from a lump of 1950 bitumen is still trapping heat today, 73 years or so after the accompanying aerosol dose fell as acid rain. Has he also accounted for the fact that the West, then China, have been addressing the aerosols with pollution controls and scrubbers before they were beginning to switch from burning fossil? Fossil burning is cleaner now, and also still, unfortunately, breaking records every year. There\u2019s also fugitive emissions of methane from wells, pipelines and old coal mines which wouldn\u2019t happen but for fossil fuel extraction.Does your author cover the fact that some areas cleared for agriculture are forest again?And does he cover the fact that reforestation also can affect albedo such that the carbon uptake might not outweigh the change in albedo? Nature Communications has a 2024 paper going over that: \u201cAccounting for albedo change to identify climate-positive tree cover restoration\u201d that shows that we need to be thoughtful about reforesting, and there are other papers out there that show restoring deep native grasslands might be more the plan in many areas (including where aridification is changing where trees might still do well).https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-46577-1JCMsays25 Mar 2025 at 8:57 AMWhenever we hear professional climate communicators claim that an event is primarily due to fossil fuel burning, or some similarly exaggerated framing, we should recognize that such statements are not based on the best available evidence \u2013 be it conventional accounting schemes (47% FF burning) or novel method (18% FF burning). Instead, they represent a distortion of both science and academic publishing.This trend is causing serious reputational harm to the field by legitimizing the introduction of misleading claims into legal proceedings. Half-truths are, in essence, total lies. It seems that the normalization of half-truths has become so widespread that even respected scientists have lost sight of the fact that they are engaging in deception, perhaps under the belief that the ends justify the means.I think it\u2019s completely obvious how public facing climate science communication and associated finance is 100% focused on fossil fuel elimination, which is a noble pursuit. However, in the process of leveraging legitimate science as a tool for political persuasion, the reliance on oversimplified narratives is seriously damaging perception of the field\u2019s credibility. Alarmingly, this has created a dynamic where conservation practitioners and climate protection allies like myself are treated as adversaries if we don\u2019t fully subscribe to and fixate on the dominant narrative \u2013 though this attitude is largely confined to online climate enthusiasts rather than qualified professionals IRL.Barton Paul Levensonsays26 Mar 2025 at 11:41 AMJCM: Whenever we hear professional climate communicators claim that an event is primarily due to fossil fuel burning, or some similarly exaggerated framing, we should recognize that such statements are not based on the best available evidenceBPL: Whenever we hear JCM say something like this, we should recognize that such statements are not based on any available evidence at all.b fagansays26 Mar 2025 at 12:08 PM@JCM \u2013 I asked some questions about this one guy\u2019s paper and the broadness of its claim and some possible holes in his logic.

Read about efforts to improve yields of rice without flooding paddies, or food additives to reduce methane in cattle.Please provide some published science that would back up the equivalence of heating and cooling for burning of a unit of fossil fuel that would leave the two effects equal, despite the observed reality that warming CO2 persists in the atmosphere far far longer than the cooling aerosols from the same source fossil fuel burn. Also, please address the same topic but account for the decrease in aerosols produced as nations implement more and more pollution controls while still burning carbon fuels. If you believe the warming/cooling ratios of emissions from a modern supercritical coal plant in the US is the same as the first coal plants in 1800s UK or mid-last-century China, I\u2019d really like to see your evidence, since that was a big part of the paper you brought to this forum.Seriously \u2013 science is about asking \u201cwhere\u2019s your evidence\u201d when a claim is made. The typical helpful scientific response is not to go into a defensive crouch and argue \u201cconservative\u201d is being picked on, if by \u201cconservative\u201d you are talking about people who, currently, are casting about for novel ways to avoid the conclusion that fossil fuels are producing the bulk of warming this century and the second half of the previous century.So where\u2019s your evidence?JCMsays27 Mar 2025 at 1:35 PMFair enough. My interest was in the extreme bias in perception created in the climate space. It is not my modus operandi to tear apart a paper \u2013 your ideas seem just fine. I\u2019m sure someone would be eager to count emissions with you in this context. Maybe they will chime in on your specific interests.Regardless whether it\u2019s the controversial 18% or the conventional 47%, it makes no difference. We all know the standard line: \u201cthe climate has already been warmed by 1.3C due primarily to the burning of fossil fuels\u201d \u2122.

The various distortions here are a symptom of something quite insidious. The examples are accumulating.Nevertheless, academic style contributions from conservationists such as Wedderburn-Bisshop in the framework of emission counting offers a useful reminder.Underpinning the message is the carbon opportunity cost, which aligns directly as a proxy: We are all on the hook for profound ecological dysfunction. Billions and billions of hectares rendered to rockflour, disappearance of species, and erosion of the essential regulatory functions of the planet. This has critically weakened the natural buffers that sustained stability for millennia. I think it\u2019s not controversial.Emission counting is just one of many possible approaches to conservation. The role of aerosol co-emissions is already well established, yet it\u2019s striking how many seem oblivious. I can\u2019t imagine why this is the point of contention. In any case, it should be obvious how climate falls under the umbrella of Earth system science; not that Earth science falls under a scheme fixated with FF emission.I welcome ideas to jolt people into awareness of environmental conservation, numerous co-benefits, and the direct connection to changes outside, from any perspective.Susan Andersonsays29 Mar 2025 at 6:48 PManyone paying attention:B Fagan is one of the finest communicators around. He doesn\u2019t clutter this comment section, but he is always worth a careful read or listen.Please. JCMsays 25 Mar 2025 at 8:57 AM Whenever we hear professional climate communicators claim that an event is primarily due to fossil fuel burning, or some similarly exaggerated framing, we should recognize that such statements are not based on the best available evidence \u2013 be it conventional accounting schemes (47% FF burning) or novel method (18% FF burning). Instead, they represent a distortion of both science and academic publishing. This trend is causing serious reputational harm to the field by legitimizing the introduction of misleading claims into legal proceedings. Half-truths are, in essence, total lies. It seems that the normalization of half-truths has become so widespread that even respected scientists have lost sight of the fact that they are engaging in deception, perhaps under the belief that the ends justify the means. I think it\u2019s completely obvious how public facing climate science communication and associated finance is 100% focused on fossil fuel elimination, which is a noble pursuit. However, in the process of leveraging legitimate science as a tool for political persuasion, the reliance on oversimplified narratives is seriously damaging perception of the field\u2019s credibility. Alarmingly, this has created a dynamic where conservation practitioners and climate protection allies like myself are treated as adversaries if we don\u2019t fully subscribe to and fixate on the dominant narrative \u2013 though this attitude is largely confined to online climate enthusiasts rather than qualified professionals IRL.

JCMsays 20 Mar 2025 at 7:53 AM \u201c\u201d\u201dit would be absurd to assume that the risk of a Lake Palcacocha outburst could be calculated based solely on historical data, without explicitly accounting for global warming caused by fossil fuels\u201d\u201d\u201d Based on the article provided by Secular Animisthttps://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2025/03/unforced-variations-mar-2025/#comment-831238\u2013 Isn\u2019t the idea that, through the current calibrated global warming schemes and nebulous feedback factors, Fossil Fuel emission is currently responsible for only 18% of effective radiative forcing, and land use emission to have caused 60% (32%-87%)? https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/adb7f2 \u201cWe compare these results with conventional accounting and find that this approach boosts perceived carbon emissions from deforestation, and finds agriculture, the most extensive land user, to be the leading emissions sector and to have caused 60% (32%\u201387%) of ERF change since 1750. We also find that fossil fuels are responsible for 18% of ERF, a reduced contribution due to masking from cooling co-emissions\u201d This isn\u2019t to downplay opposition to fossil-fueled development, but it\u2019s striking how the cumulative emissions and net radiative forcing from land management far exceed those from fossil fuels. This estimate also doesn\u2019t account for the destruction of biologically mediated precipitation regulation, such as the loss of pollen, bacteria, and fungi, which plays a significant role in atmospheric dynamics. In various forums, the ecological destruction commencing for real in 20th century is actively minimized in the current campaign for climate protection, in spite of obvious significant indicators such as 73% of wildlife populations perishing since 1970https://findingnature.org.uk/2024/10/10/visualising-the-crisis-of-biodiversity-loss/, and the previously mentioned overwhelming contribution of landscape management to net forcing. any insights into this obvious and potentially damaging bias is appreciated. b fagansays23 Mar 2025 at 9:09 PMHi JCM. I\u2019m not familiar with large-scale climate messaging from a \u201creduce fossil use rapidly\u201d standpoint that fails to include benefits to the biosphere due to less pollution, less land disturbance, less water demand, etc. So you might perceive \u201cactively minimized\u201d emphasis, but I\u2019ve not. Most of the time when I see advocacy to halt warming the planet, they\u2019re not saying things like: \u201cbut use more land to graze cattle before fattening them\u201d, for example, or suggesting wind farms shouldn\u2019t be sited and operated with the idea of minimizing harm to birds and bats.Regarding the single-author study you mention (the quote using the royal \u201cwe\u201d) I\u2019d really want to see others analyze his novel economic view rigorously before accepting results, especially since he notes some of the detail he includes is \u2018indicative\u2019 due to large assumptions or lack of data precision.Another point I\u2019m not sure he is properly accounting for is his massive discounting of the impacts of fossil fuels as a forcing due to cooling from their aerosols. His figure 1 appears to show that warming from fossil fuel CO2 is pretty much completely negated by accompanying aerosols. It looks very much like it doesn\u2019t take into account that persistence means some of the CO2 from a lump of 1950 bitumen is still trapping heat today, 73 years or so after the accompanying aerosol dose fell as acid rain. Has he also accounted for the fact that the West, then China, have been addressing the aerosols with pollution controls and scrubbers before they were beginning to switch from burning fossil? Fossil burning is cleaner now, and also still, unfortunately, breaking records every year. There\u2019s also fugitive emissions of methane from wells, pipelines and old coal mines which wouldn\u2019t happen but for fossil fuel extraction.Does your author cover the fact that some areas cleared for agriculture are forest again?And does he cover the fact that reforestation also can affect albedo such that the carbon uptake might not outweigh the change in albedo? Nature Communications has a 2024 paper going over that: \u201cAccounting for albedo change to identify climate-positive tree cover restoration\u201d that shows that we need to be thoughtful about reforesting, and there are other papers out there that show restoring deep native grasslands might be more the plan in many areas (including where aridification is changing where trees might still do well).https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-46577-1JCMsays25 Mar 2025 at 8:57 AMWhenever we hear professional climate communicators claim that an event is primarily due to fossil fuel burning, or some similarly exaggerated framing, we should recognize that such statements are not based on the best available evidence \u2013 be it conventional accounting schemes (47% FF burning) or novel method (18% FF burning). Instead, they represent a distortion of both science and academic publishing.This trend is causing serious reputational harm to the field by legitimizing the introduction of misleading claims into legal proceedings. Half-truths are, in essence, total lies. It seems that the normalization of half-truths has become so widespread that even respected scientists have lost sight of the fact that they are engaging in deception, perhaps under the belief that the ends justify the means.I think it\u2019s completely obvious how public facing climate science communication and associated finance is 100% focused on fossil fuel elimination, which is a noble pursuit. However, in the process of leveraging legitimate science as a tool for political persuasion, the reliance on oversimplified narratives is seriously damaging perception of the field\u2019s credibility. Alarmingly, this has created a dynamic where conservation practitioners and climate protection allies like myself are treated as adversaries if we don\u2019t fully subscribe to and fixate on the dominant narrative \u2013 though this attitude is largely confined to online climate enthusiasts rather than qualified professionals IRL.Barton Paul Levensonsays26 Mar 2025 at 11:41 AMJCM: Whenever we hear professional climate communicators claim that an event is primarily due to fossil fuel burning, or some similarly exaggerated framing, we should recognize that such statements are not based on the best available evidenceBPL: Whenever we hear JCM say something like this, we should recognize that such statements are not based on any available evidence at all.b fagansays26 Mar 2025 at 12:08 PM@JCM \u2013 I asked some questions about this one guy\u2019s paper and the broadness of its claim and some possible holes in his logic. Instead of addressing those you accuse me of being mean?And again, your comments like \u201cI think it\u2019s completely obvious how public facing climate science communication and associated finance is 100% focused on fossil fuel elimination, which is a noble pursuit..\u201d may be completely obvious to you, but when I see discussions of dealing with sources of warming, the agricultural methane production from ruminants and rice is very commonly part of the overall set of things to manage. Read about efforts to improve yields of rice without flooding paddies, or food additives to reduce methane in cattle.Please provide some published science that would back up the equivalence of heating and cooling for burning of a unit of fossil fuel that would leave the two effects equal, despite the observed reality that warming CO2 persists in the atmosphere far far longer than the cooling aerosols from the same source fossil fuel burn. Also, please address the same topic but account for the decrease in aerosols produced as nations implement more and more pollution controls while still burning carbon fuels. If you believe the warming/cooling ratios of emissions from a modern supercritical coal plant in the US is the same as the first coal plants in 1800s UK or mid-last-century China, I\u2019d really like to see your evidence, since that was a big part of the paper you brought to this forum.Seriously \u2013 science is about asking \u201cwhere\u2019s your evidence\u201d when a claim is made. The typical helpful scientific response is not to go into a defensive crouch and argue \u201cconservative\u201d is being picked on, if by \u201cconservative\u201d you are talking about people who, currently, are casting about for novel ways to avoid the conclusion that fossil fuels are producing the bulk of warming this century and the second half of the previous century.So where\u2019s your evidence?JCMsays27 Mar 2025 at 1:35 PMFair enough. My interest was in the extreme bias in perception created in the climate space. It is not my modus operandi to tear apart a paper \u2013 your ideas seem just fine. I\u2019m sure someone would be eager to count emissions with you in this context. Maybe they will chime in on your specific interests.Regardless whether it\u2019s the controversial 18% or the conventional 47%, it makes no difference. We all know the standard line: \u201cthe climate has already been warmed by 1.3C due primarily to the burning of fossil fuels\u201d \u2122. Then come the conclusions about some recent event, where conditions \u201cwere made 200-500 times more likely due to the burning of fossil fuels\u201d. Exactly like that, in official looking stuff; documents for policymakers, etc.I suspect that, on some level, climate enthusiasts recognize these claims as deceptive, but that awareness is vanishingly rare. If you have any insights into this obvious and potentially damaging bias, I\u2019d be interested. I think we see aspects of the carnage already on full display right on this very thread.I noticed your cattle and rice ideas; such as providing food additives, or avoid flooding, which is nice thinking. At the same time, it seems to be completely unserious and disproportionate in perspective about the real scale of environmental destruction ongoing, and how this relates directly to the changes outside to date. This disconnected and disproportionate framing is embedded deep into all aspects of how the issue is communicated. This is the type of thing I\u2019m interested about.Tom\u00e1\u0161 Kaliszsays27 Mar 2025 at 5:19 PMIn Re to b fagan, 26 Mar 2025 at 12:08 PM,https://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2025/03/andean-glaciers-have-shrunk-more-than-ever-before-in-the-holocene/#comment-831546Dear Sir,I would like to make you aware of the circumstance that the controversial Wedderburn-Bisshop article was cited by Secular Animist already on 17 Mar 2025 at 3:36 PM,https://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2025/03/unforced-variations-mar-2025/#comment-831238,and has not attracted any attention in the original thread yet.With respect to perceived incompatibility of attributions made in this article with attributions made in earlier literature, I would like to ask a more generic question regarding attribution studies: Are we indeed sure that there is no \u201cneglected forcing\u201d, so far arbitrarily considered unimportant and thus not included in evalutions yet, although it does in fact play a certain role?Specifically, I am so far aware of a single study, by Lague et alhttps://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/acdbe1,wherein the authors attempted to quantify the role of water availability for evaporation from the land as a climate forcing.It appears that so far, there is np global reconstruction of past precipitation and that prevailing view on Earth hydrology still takes global water cycle intensity as a mere feedback to global mean surface temperature changes,I am therefore afraid that possible historical changes in water availability for evaporation from land might have never been considered as a possible forcing in attribution studies.And yet another question regarding attribution studies. How will be the attribution made for a forcing that does not work directly (or has only a quite weak direct warming or cooling effect on global climate), however, it strongly changes climate sensitivity to other forcings?If you could provide explanations and/or some references clarifying these questions, I will highly appreciate your help.Best regardsTom\u00e1\u0161Barton Paul Levensonsays28 Mar 2025 at 8:13 AMJCM: We all know the standard line: \u201cthe climate has already been warmed by 1.3C due primarily to the burning of fossil fuels\u201d \u2122.

Nature Communications has a 2024 paper going over that: \u201cAccounting for albedo change to identify climate-positive tree cover restoration\u201d that shows that we need to be thoughtful about reforesting, and there are other papers out there that show restoring deep native grasslands might be more the plan in many areas (including where aridification is changing where trees might still do well). https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-46577-1 JCMsays25 Mar 2025 at 8:57 AMWhenever we hear professional climate communicators claim that an event is primarily due to fossil fuel burning, or some similarly exaggerated framing, we should recognize that such statements are not based on the best available evidence \u2013 be it conventional accounting schemes (47% FF burning) or novel method (18% FF burning). Instead, they represent a distortion of both science and academic publishing.This trend is causing serious reputational harm to the field by legitimizing the introduction of misleading claims into legal proceedings. Half-truths are, in essence, total lies.

However, in the process of leveraging legitimate science as a tool for political persuasion, the reliance on oversimplified narratives is seriously damaging perception of the field\u2019s credibility.

How will be the attribution made for a forcing that does not work directly (or has only a quite weak direct warming or cooling effect on global climate), however, it strongly changes climate sensitivity to other forcings?If you could provide explanations and/or some references clarifying these questions, I will highly appreciate your help.Best regardsTom\u00e1\u0161Barton Paul Levensonsays28 Mar 2025 at 8:13 AMJCM: We all know the standard line: \u201cthe climate has already been warmed by 1.3C due primarily to the burning of fossil fuels\u201d \u2122.

Billions and billions of hectares rendered to rockflour, disappearance of species, and erosion of the essential regulatory functions of the planet. This has critically weakened the natural buffers that sustained stability for millennia. I think it\u2019s not controversial.Emission counting is just one of many possible approaches to conservation. The role of aerosol co-emissions is already well established, yet it\u2019s striking how many seem oblivious. I can\u2019t imagine why this is the point of contention. In any case, it should be obvious how climate falls under the umbrella of Earth system science; not that Earth science falls under a scheme fixated with FF emission.I welcome ideas to jolt people into awareness of environmental conservation, numerous co-benefits, and the direct connection to changes outside, from any perspective.Susan Andersonsays29 Mar 2025 at 6:48 PManyone paying attention:B Fagan is one of the finest communicators around.

I\u2019m not familiar with large-scale climate messaging from a \u201creduce fossil use rapidly\u201d standpoint that fails to include benefits to the biosphere due to less pollution, less land disturbance, less water demand, etc. So you might perceive \u201cactively minimized\u201d emphasis, but I\u2019ve not. Most of the time when I see advocacy to halt warming the planet, they\u2019re not saying things like: \u201cbut use more land to graze cattle before fattening them\u201d, for example, or suggesting wind farms shouldn\u2019t be sited and operated with the idea of minimizing harm to birds and bats. Regarding the single-author study you mention (the quote using the royal \u201cwe\u201d) I\u2019d really want to see others analyze his novel economic view rigorously before accepting results, especially since he notes some of the detail he includes is \u2018indicative\u2019 due to large assumptions or lack of data precision. Another point I\u2019m not sure he is properly accounting for is his massive discounting of the impacts of fossil fuels as a forcing due to cooling from their aerosols. His figure 1 appears to show that warming from fossil fuel CO2 is pretty much completely negated by accompanying aerosols. It looks very much like it doesn\u2019t take into account that persistence means some of the CO2 from a lump of 1950 bitumen is still trapping heat today, 73 years or so after the accompanying aerosol dose fell as acid rain. Has he also accounted for the fact that the West, then China, have been addressing the aerosols with pollution controls and scrubbers before they were beginning to switch from burning fossil? Fossil burning is cleaner now, and also still, unfortunately, breaking records every year. There\u2019s also fugitive emissions of methane from wells, pipelines and old coal mines which wouldn\u2019t happen but for fossil fuel extraction. Does your author cover the fact that some areas cleared for agriculture are forest again? And does he cover the fact that reforestation also can affect albedo such that the carbon uptake might not outweigh the change in albedo? Nature Communications has a 2024 paper going over that: \u201cAccounting for albedo change to identify climate-positive tree cover restoration\u201d that shows that we need to be thoughtful about reforesting, and there are other papers out there that show restoring deep native grasslands might be more the plan in many areas (including where aridification is changing where trees might still do well). https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-46577-1 JCMsays25 Mar 2025 at 8:57 AMWhenever we hear professional climate communicators claim that an event is primarily due to fossil fuel burning, or some similarly exaggerated framing, we should recognize that such statements are not based on the best available evidence \u2013 be it conventional accounting schemes (47% FF burning) or novel method (18% FF burning). Instead, they represent a distortion of both science and academic publishing.This trend is causing serious reputational harm to the field by legitimizing the introduction of misleading claims into legal proceedings. Half-truths are, in essence, total lies. It seems that the normalization of half-truths has become so widespread that even respected scientists have lost sight of the fact that they are engaging in deception, perhaps under the belief that the ends justify the means.I think it\u2019s completely obvious how public facing climate science communication and associated finance is 100% focused on fossil fuel elimination, which is a noble pursuit. However, in the process of leveraging legitimate science as a tool for political persuasion, the reliance on oversimplified narratives is seriously damaging perception of the field\u2019s credibility. Alarmingly, this has created a dynamic where conservation practitioners and climate protection allies like myself are treated as adversaries if we don\u2019t fully subscribe to and fixate on the dominant narrative \u2013 though this attitude is largely confined to online climate enthusiasts rather than qualified professionals IRL.Barton Paul Levensonsays26 Mar 2025 at 11:41 AMJCM: Whenever we hear professional climate communicators claim that an event is primarily due to fossil fuel burning, or some similarly exaggerated framing, we should recognize that such statements are not based on the best available evidenceBPL: Whenever we hear JCM say something like this, we should recognize that such statements are not based on any available evidence at all.b fagansays26 Mar 2025 at 12:08 PM@JCM \u2013 I asked some questions about this one guy\u2019s paper and the broadness of its claim and some possible holes in his logic. Instead of addressing those you accuse me of being mean?And again, your comments like \u201cI think it\u2019s completely obvious how public facing climate science communication and associated finance is 100% focused on fossil fuel elimination, which is a noble pursuit..\u201d may be completely obvious to you, but when I see discussions of dealing with sources of warming, the agricultural methane production from ruminants and rice is very commonly part of the overall set of things to manage. Read about efforts to improve yields of rice without flooding paddies, or food additives to reduce methane in cattle.Please provide some published science that would back up the equivalence of heating and cooling for burning of a unit of fossil fuel that would leave the two effects equal, despite the observed reality that warming CO2 persists in the atmosphere far far longer than the cooling aerosols from the same source fossil fuel burn. Also, please address the same topic but account for the decrease in aerosols produced as nations implement more and more pollution controls while still burning carbon fuels. If you believe the warming/cooling ratios of emissions from a modern supercritical coal plant in the US is the same as the first coal plants in 1800s UK or mid-last-century China, I\u2019d really like to see your evidence, since that was a big part of the paper you brought to this forum.Seriously \u2013 science is about asking \u201cwhere\u2019s your evidence\u201d when a claim is made. The typical helpful scientific response is not to go into a defensive crouch and argue \u201cconservative\u201d is being picked on, if by \u201cconservative\u201d you are talking about people who, currently, are casting about for novel ways to avoid the conclusion that fossil fuels are producing the bulk of warming this century and the second half of the previous century.So where\u2019s your evidence?JCMsays27 Mar 2025 at 1:35 PMFair enough. My interest was in the extreme bias in perception created in the climate space. It is not my modus operandi to tear apart a paper \u2013 your ideas seem just fine. I\u2019m sure someone would be eager to count emissions with you in this context. Maybe they will chime in on your specific interests.Regardless whether it\u2019s the controversial 18% or the conventional 47%, it makes no difference. We all know the standard line: \u201cthe climate has already been warmed by 1.3C due primarily to the burning of fossil fuels\u201d \u2122. Then come the conclusions about some recent event, where conditions \u201cwere made 200-500 times more likely due to the burning of fossil fuels\u201d. Exactly like that, in official looking stuff; documents for policymakers, etc.I suspect that, on some level, climate enthusiasts recognize these claims as deceptive, but that awareness is vanishingly rare. If you have any insights into this obvious and potentially damaging bias, I\u2019d be interested. I think we see aspects of the carnage already on full display right on this very thread.I noticed your cattle and rice ideas; such as providing food additives, or avoid flooding, which is nice thinking. At the same time, it seems to be completely unserious and disproportionate in perspective about the real scale of environmental destruction ongoing, and how this relates directly to the changes outside to date.

Read about efforts to improve yields of rice without flooding paddies, or food additives to reduce methane in cattle.Please provide some published science that would back up the equivalence of heating and cooling for burning of a unit of fossil fuel that would leave the two effects equal, despite the observed reality that warming CO2 persists in the atmosphere far far longer than the cooling aerosols from the same source fossil fuel burn. Also, please address the same topic but account for the decrease in aerosols produced as nations implement more and more pollution controls while still burning carbon fuels. If you believe the warming/cooling ratios of emissions from a modern supercritical coal plant in the US is the same as the first coal plants in 1800s UK or mid-last-century China, I\u2019d really like to see your evidence, since that was a big part of the paper you brought to this forum.Seriously \u2013 science is about asking \u201cwhere\u2019s your evidence\u201d when a claim is made. The typical helpful scientific response is not to go into a defensive crouch and argue \u201cconservative\u201d is being picked on, if by \u201cconservative\u201d you are talking about people who, currently, are casting about for novel ways to avoid the conclusion that fossil fuels are producing the bulk of warming this century and the second half of the previous century.So where\u2019s your evidence?JCMsays27 Mar 2025 at 1:35 PMFair enough.

Maybe they will chime in on your specific interests.Regardless whether it\u2019s the controversial 18% or the conventional 47%, it makes no difference.

Then come the conclusions about some recent event, where conditions \u201cwere made 200-500 times more likely due to the burning of fossil fuels\u201d. Exactly like that, in official looking stuff; documents for policymakers, etc.I suspect that, on some level, climate enthusiasts recognize these claims as deceptive, but that awareness is vanishingly rare. If you have any insights into this obvious and potentially damaging bias, I\u2019d be interested. I think we see aspects of the carnage already on full display right on this very thread.I noticed your cattle and rice ideas; such as providing food additives, or avoid flooding, which is nice thinking. At the same time, it seems to be completely unserious and disproportionate in perspective about the real scale of environmental destruction ongoing, and how this relates directly to the changes outside to date.

JCMsays 25 Mar 2025 at 8:57 AM Whenever we hear professional climate communicators claim that an event is primarily due to fossil fuel burning, or some similarly exaggerated framing, we should recognize that such statements are not based on the best available evidence \u2013 be it conventional accounting schemes (47% FF burning) or novel method (18% FF burning). Instead, they represent a distortion of both science and academic publishing. This trend is causing serious reputational harm to the field by legitimizing the introduction of misleading claims into legal proceedings. Half-truths are, in essence, total lies. It seems that the normalization of half-truths has become so widespread that even respected scientists have lost sight of the fact that they are engaging in deception, perhaps under the belief that the ends justify the means. I think it\u2019s completely obvious how public facing climate science communication and associated finance is 100% focused on fossil fuel elimination, which is a noble pursuit. However, in the process of leveraging legitimate science as a tool for political persuasion, the reliance on oversimplified narratives is seriously damaging perception of the field\u2019s credibility. Alarmingly, this has created a dynamic where conservation practitioners and climate protection allies like myself are treated as adversaries if we don\u2019t fully subscribe to and fixate on the dominant narrative \u2013 though this attitude is largely confined to online climate enthusiasts rather than qualified professionals IRL.

Read about efforts to improve yields of rice without flooding paddies, or food additives to reduce methane in cattle.Please provide some published science that would back up the equivalence of heating and cooling for burning of a unit of fossil fuel that would leave the two effects equal, despite the observed reality that warming CO2 persists in the atmosphere far far longer than the cooling aerosols from the same source fossil fuel burn. Also, please address the same topic but account for the decrease in aerosols produced as nations implement more and more pollution controls while still burning carbon fuels. If you believe the warming/cooling ratios of emissions from a modern supercritical coal plant in the US is the same as the first coal plants in 1800s UK or mid-last-century China, I\u2019d really like to see your evidence, since that was a big part of the paper you brought to this forum.Seriously \u2013 science is about asking \u201cwhere\u2019s your evidence\u201d when a claim is made. The typical helpful scientific response is not to go into a defensive crouch and argue \u201cconservative\u201d is being picked on, if by \u201cconservative\u201d you are talking about people who, currently, are casting about for novel ways to avoid the conclusion that fossil fuels are producing the bulk of warming this century and the second half of the previous century.So where\u2019s your evidence?JCMsays27 Mar 2025 at 1:35 PMFair enough. My interest was in the extreme bias in perception created in the climate space. It is not my modus operandi to tear apart a paper \u2013 your ideas seem just fine.

Maybe they will chime in on your specific interests.Regardless whether it\u2019s the controversial 18% or the conventional 47%, it makes no difference.

Then come the conclusions about some recent event, where conditions \u201cwere made 200-500 times more likely due to the burning of fossil fuels\u201d. Exactly like that, in official looking stuff; documents for policymakers, etc.I suspect that, on some level, climate enthusiasts recognize these claims as deceptive, but that awareness is vanishingly rare. If you have any insights into this obvious and potentially damaging bias, I\u2019d be interested. I think we see aspects of the carnage already on full display right on this very thread.I noticed your cattle and rice ideas; such as providing food additives, or avoid flooding, which is nice thinking. At the same time, it seems to be completely unserious and disproportionate in perspective about the real scale of environmental destruction ongoing, and how this relates directly to the changes outside to date.

Please provide some published science that would back up the equivalence of heating and cooling for burning of a unit of fossil fuel that would leave the two effects equal, despite the observed reality that warming CO2 persists in the atmosphere far far longer than the cooling aerosols from the same source fossil fuel burn. Also, please address the same topic but account for the decrease in aerosols produced as nations implement more and more pollution controls while still burning carbon fuels. If you believe the warming/cooling ratios of emissions from a modern supercritical coal plant in the US is the same as the first coal plants in 1800s UK or mid-last-century China, I\u2019d really like to see your evidence, since that was a big part of the paper you brought to this forum. Seriously \u2013 science is about asking \u201cwhere\u2019s your evidence\u201d when a claim is made. The typical helpful scientific response is not to go into a defensive crouch and argue \u201cconservative\u201d is being picked on, if by \u201cconservative\u201d you are talking about people who, currently, are casting about for novel ways to avoid the conclusion that fossil fuels are producing the bulk of warming this century and the second half of the previous century. So where\u2019s your evidence? JCMsays27 Mar 2025 at 1:35 PMFair enough. My interest was in the extreme bias in perception created in the climate space. It is not my modus operandi to tear apart a paper \u2013 your ideas seem just fine. I\u2019m sure someone would be eager to count emissions with you in this context. Maybe they will chime in on your specific interests.Regardless whether it\u2019s the controversial 18% or the conventional 47%, it makes no difference. We all know the standard line: \u201cthe climate has already been warmed by 1.3C due primarily to the burning of fossil fuels\u201d \u2122. Then come the conclusions about some recent event, where conditions \u201cwere made 200-500 times more likely due to the burning of fossil fuels\u201d. Exactly like that, in official looking stuff; documents for policymakers, etc.I suspect that, on some level, climate enthusiasts recognize these claims as deceptive, but that awareness is vanishingly rare. If you have any insights into this obvious and potentially damaging bias, I\u2019d be interested. I think we see aspects of the carnage already on full display right on this very thread.I noticed your cattle and rice ideas; such as providing food additives, or avoid flooding, which is nice thinking. At the same time, it seems to be completely unserious and disproportionate in perspective about the real scale of environmental destruction ongoing, and how this relates directly to the changes outside to date. This disconnected and disproportionate framing is embedded deep into all aspects of how the issue is communicated. This is the type of thing I\u2019m interested about.

How will be the attribution made for a forcing that does not work directly (or has only a quite weak direct warming or cooling effect on global climate), however, it strongly changes climate sensitivity to other forcings?If you could provide explanations and/or some references clarifying these questions, I will highly appreciate your help.Best regardsTom\u00e1\u0161 Tom\u00e1\u0161 Kaliszsays 27 Mar 2025 at 5:19 PM In Re to b fagan, 26 Mar 2025 at 12:08 PM, https://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2025/03/andean-glaciers-have-shrunk-more-than-ever-before-in-the-holocene/#comment-831546 Dear Sir, I would like to make you aware of the circumstance that the controversial Wedderburn-Bisshop article was cited by Secular Animist already on 17 Mar 2025 at 3:36 PM, https://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2025/03/unforced-variations-mar-2025/#comment-831238, and has not attracted any attention in the original thread yet.

Surely they should have used numbers closer to their own findings..And even assuming their 50:50 split, surely 5000 years of exposure in a high diurnal temperature range environment would have led to significant breakup of the top few metres leading to much higher erosion and mass transport once the glacier was reestablished.And their whole assumption is that there is either ice to some random thickness, or bare rock. .I see nothing in their paper to negate the possibility that there was 1000 years of no glaciation followed by 9000 years of significant glaciationjgnfldsays24 Mar 2025 at 3:25 PMYou could write a letter to the editor of Science stating your \u201ccriticisms\u201d, you know.

Dave_Geologistsays23 Mar 2025 at 10:41 AMI presume it\u2019s because RWE is an electricity generator, and Germany has made some bad moves by burning far too much lignite for far too long, and in shutting down nukes early for political reasons. There are renewable options for generating electricity, and have been for decades (and even FF options rank gas < oil < hard coal < lignite in terms of CO2 per kWh). And Germans are rich enough to subsidise a rapid transition, where Indians or Nepalis are not.FF producers are harder to attribute because 95-98% of \"their\" emissions are from their customers, not from their own operations. Those are my, our and your emissions, not Shell's. And like it or lump it, there is a large installed base of stuff running on them, probably amounting to more than global GDP if we shut them all down tomorrow. Stuff on which we all depend.Why not sue everyone who has or ever had a car, aircon or central heating? And whose parents and grandparents had coal fires? And Indian villagers burning cow dung? Ford and GM for being too slow to roll out electric cars? Boeing and Airbus? Thomas Cook and KLM? Hotels in Vegas, Acapulco and the Costa Brava?Their ownlocal power company? The local farmers? Pretty soon you\u2019ll have spread the target so thin you\u2019ll have paid out more in legal fees even if you do win.Piotrsays24 Mar 2025 at 4:10 PMFF producers are harder to attribute because 95-98% of \u201ctheir\u201d emissions are from their customers, not from their own operations.First, 6 Gt from the production, transport and processing of FF is 15% out of the total of 38 Gt, not \u201c2-5%\u201d as you imply with your \u201c95-98%\u201d. Second, it is the FF producers who have made trillions of dollars in net profits, and it is them who getsabout half a trillion dollars annually in subsidies for doing so. So I wouldn\u2019t be so quick with getting them off the hook.In fact, Dave, you and most of us, are a success story for the effectiveness of the fossil-fuel messaging described a few years back by Mark Kaufmann:===\u201cBritish Petroleum, the second largest non-state owned oil company in the world, with 18,700 gas and service stations worldwide, hired the public relations professionals Ogilvy & Mather to promote the slant that climate change is not the fault of an oil giant, but that of individuals. It\u2019s here that BP, first promoted and soon successfully popularized the term \u201ccarbon footprint\u201d in the early aughts. The company unveiled its \u201ccarbon footprint calculator\u201d in 2004 so one could assess how their normal daily life \u2013 going to work, buying food, and (gasp) traveling \u2013 is largely responsible for heating the globe.\u201d===So the goals of the campaign designed by one of the leading PR companies in the US, were twofold:1.to redirect the responsibility\u2013 \u201cIt\u2019s not us, it\u2019s you\u201d \u2013 so unless you, the consumer, have sworn off EVERY imaginable use of fossil fuels \u2013 i.e. \u201cno car, no aircon, no central heating\u201c, then you are in no position to criticize fossil fuel corporations that make trillions in net profits on emitting 15% of the total fossil fuel emissions,2.to sow apathy\u2013 when people run their personal GHG calculator and see that, short of the life-changing sacrifices, they won\u2019t be able to reduce their emissions ENOUGH \u2013 then why bother at all, let\u2019s enjoy our consumption while it lasts -and \u201cAfter us, Deluge!\u201dBoth effect \u2013 the redirection and the encouraged apathy \u2013 get the Fossil Fuel Industrial Complex and the politicians they bought \u2013 off the hook.And it worked like a miracle \u2013 despite a few critics here and there (Mark Kaufmann, Bill McKibben)\u2013 those of us concerned about the environment internalized ^* the message\u2013 while the deniers got a handy weapon to bash us with: \u201cif you haven\u2019t reduced your personal emissions to ZERO , then you are hypocrite and have no moral right to criticize others who drive big trucks, live in big houses and fly in private jets, nor you have the right you criticize the fossil fuel lobbyists that delay any meaningful action on AGW to protect their profits.\u201dP.S. How well we internalized the message \u2013 is illustrated when Dave, a good-will, reasonable, educated man, seems to have swallowed the BP\u2019s argument, hook. line and sinker \u2013 presents it here as his own views (see above) and even take\u2019s BP argument \u2026. further:Dave_Geologist: \u201cWhy not sue [\u2026] Indian villagers burning cow dung?\u201deven though these Indian villagers, unlike BP, Exon, Saudi Arabia or Russia, don\u2019t make \u2026 $ billions or trillions from that, nor the \u201ccow dung\u201d is \u2026 even a \u201cfossil fuel\u201d.Oh, the power of corporate persuasion\u2026Dave_Geologistsays25 Mar 2025 at 8:43 AMSource for that 15% please, Piotr? Those are 5-10000-mile pipeline or LNG tanker numbers. If you\u2019re including the energy used to turn crude into Barbi, or the BP crude the Kochs buy, refine and retail (they don\u2019t own any wells), those are customer overheads, not producer overhead.And sorry, that half a trillion is a common trope, but it\u2019s as wrong as \u201cCO2 is plant food\u201d. In most of the world (maybe not the US, but certainly the UK, Australia and OPEC), O&G production is taxed higher than normal businesses, directly (PRT) or indirectly (subsidising State Oil Company costs, government take higher than investment share, extended capital depreciation periods compared to everyone else). Tax relief on decommissioning is an allowable business expense. The now-controversial UK scheme was a net positive to the taxman (relief now for taxes paid on revenue decades ago, and no inflation allowance). Fuel burnt in operations is tax-deductible, and the taxman can read company accounts just like you and me. Do you really think BP is giving up 25% tax relief on 10% of it\u2019s operational costs, just for some less unkind PR? Piss-poor Big Bad Wolf if they are!It\u2019s a particularly pernicious myth because it leads people to believe there\u2019s a fortune out there that can fund decarbonisation at no cost to us. There isn\u2019t. I look out my window and see three SUVs and my hatchback. Did BP force my neighbours to buy cars half a ton heavier than mine? Personal responsibility cuts both ways, and all ways. Profits are a few dollars a barrel, it would take more like a $50 a barrel tax to make people change their habits.The big numbers that are thrown around (usually without attribution but I\u2019ll see if I can find the EU estimate which has the detail) is mainly consumer subsidies in OPEC countries, selling the product at less than market price, and a non-charged cost-of-carbon externality. Your carbon, my carbon, and granny in China\u2019s carbon. It includes carbon credits grandfathered to steel mills, and things like the government carrying the cost of nuclear waste disposal and nuclear accident risk, rather than the generators taking out private insurance. Even the low VAT the UK charges domestic energy consumers is counted as a subsidy to the energy industry, as is the green levy charged to consumers to pay for subsidised wind and solar contracts.

Dave_Geologistsays 23 Mar 2025 at 10:41 AM I presume it\u2019s because RWE is an electricity generator, and Germany has made some bad moves by burning far too much lignite for far too long, and in shutting down nukes early for political reasons. There are renewable options for generating electricity, and have been for decades (and even FF options rank gas < oil < hard coal < lignite in terms of CO2 per kWh). And Germans are rich enough to subsidise a rapid transition, where Indians or Nepalis are not. FF producers are harder to attribute because 95-98% of \"their\" emissions are from their customers, not from their own operations. Those are my, our and your emissions, not Shell's. And like it or lump it, there is a large installed base of stuff running on them, probably amounting to more than global GDP if we shut them all down tomorrow. Stuff on which we all depend. Why not sue everyone who has or ever had a car, aircon or central heating? And whose parents and grandparents had coal fires? And Indian villagers burning cow dung? Ford and GM for being too slow to roll out electric cars? Boeing and Airbus? Thomas Cook and KLM? Hotels in Vegas, Acapulco and the Costa Brava?Their ownlocal power company? The local farmers? Pretty soon you\u2019ll have spread the target so thin you\u2019ll have paid out more in legal fees even if you do win. Piotrsays24 Mar 2025 at 4:10 PMFF producers are harder to attribute because 95-98% of \u201ctheir\u201d emissions are from their customers, not from their own operations.First, 6 Gt from the production, transport and processing of FF is 15% out of the total of 38 Gt, not \u201c2-5%\u201d as you imply with your \u201c95-98%\u201d. Second, it is the FF producers who have made trillions of dollars in net profits, and it is them who getsabout half a trillion dollars annually in subsidies for doing so. So I wouldn\u2019t be so quick with getting them off the hook.In fact, Dave, you and most of us, are a success story for the effectiveness of the fossil-fuel messaging described a few years back by Mark Kaufmann:===\u201cBritish Petroleum, the second largest non-state owned oil company in the world, with 18,700 gas and service stations worldwide, hired the public relations professionals Ogilvy & Mather to promote the slant that climate change is not the fault of an oil giant, but that of individuals. It\u2019s here that BP, first promoted and soon successfully popularized the term \u201ccarbon footprint\u201d in the early aughts. The company unveiled its \u201ccarbon footprint calculator\u201d in 2004 so one could assess how their normal daily life \u2013 going to work, buying food, and (gasp) traveling \u2013 is largely responsible for heating the globe.\u201d===So the goals of the campaign designed by one of the leading PR companies in the US, were twofold:1.to redirect the responsibility\u2013 \u201cIt\u2019s not us, it\u2019s you\u201d \u2013 so unless you, the consumer, have sworn off EVERY imaginable use of fossil fuels \u2013 i.e. \u201cno car, no aircon, no central heating\u201c, then you are in no position to criticize fossil fuel corporations that make trillions in net profits on emitting 15% of the total fossil fuel emissions,2.to sow apathy\u2013 when people run their personal GHG calculator and see that, short of the life-changing sacrifices, they won\u2019t be able to reduce their emissions ENOUGH \u2013 then why bother at all, let\u2019s enjoy our consumption while it lasts -and \u201cAfter us, Deluge!\u201dBoth effect \u2013 the redirection and the encouraged apathy \u2013 get the Fossil Fuel Industrial Complex and the politicians they bought \u2013 off the hook.And it worked like a miracle \u2013 despite a few critics here and there (Mark Kaufmann, Bill McKibben)\u2013 those of us concerned about the environment internalized ^* the message\u2013 while the deniers got a handy weapon to bash us with: \u201cif you haven\u2019t reduced your personal emissions to ZERO , then you are hypocrite and have no moral right to criticize others who drive big trucks, live in big houses and fly in private jets, nor you have the right you criticize the fossil fuel lobbyists that delay any meaningful action on AGW to protect their profits.\u201dP.S.

In most of the world (maybe not the US, but certainly the UK, Australia and OPEC), O&G production is taxed higher than normal businesses, directly (PRT) or indirectly (subsidising State Oil Company costs, government take higher than investment share, extended capital depreciation periods compared to everyone else). Tax relief on decommissioning is an allowable business expense. The now-controversial UK scheme was a net positive to the taxman (relief now for taxes paid on revenue decades ago, and no inflation allowance). Fuel burnt in operations is tax-deductible, and the taxman can read company accounts just like you and me. Do you really think BP is giving up 25% tax relief on 10% of it\u2019s operational costs, just for some less unkind PR?

Your carbon, my carbon, and granny in China\u2019s carbon. It includes carbon credits grandfathered to steel mills, and things like the government carrying the cost of nuclear waste disposal and nuclear accident risk, rather than the generators taking out private insurance.

And Germans are rich enough to subsidise a rapid transition, where Indians or Nepalis are not. FF producers are harder to attribute because 95-98% of \"their\" emissions are from their customers, not from their own operations. Those are my, our and your emissions, not Shell's. And like it or lump it, there is a large installed base of stuff running on them, probably amounting to more than global GDP if we shut them all down tomorrow. Stuff on which we all depend. Why not sue everyone who has or ever had a car, aircon or central heating? And whose parents and grandparents had coal fires? And Indian villagers burning cow dung? Ford and GM for being too slow to roll out electric cars? Boeing and Airbus? Thomas Cook and KLM? Hotels in Vegas, Acapulco and the Costa Brava?Their ownlocal power company? The local farmers? Pretty soon you\u2019ll have spread the target so thin you\u2019ll have paid out more in legal fees even if you do win. Piotrsays24 Mar 2025 at 4:10 PMFF producers are harder to attribute because 95-98% of \u201ctheir\u201d emissions are from their customers, not from their own operations.First, 6 Gt from the production, transport and processing of FF is 15% out of the total of 38 Gt, not \u201c2-5%\u201d as you imply with your \u201c95-98%\u201d. Second, it is the FF producers who have made trillions of dollars in net profits, and it is them who getsabout half a trillion dollars annually in subsidies for doing so.

In most of the world (maybe not the US, but certainly the UK, Australia and OPEC), O&G production is taxed higher than normal businesses, directly (PRT) or indirectly (subsidising State Oil Company costs, government take higher than investment share, extended capital depreciation periods compared to everyone else). Tax relief on decommissioning is an allowable business expense. The now-controversial UK scheme was a net positive to the taxman (relief now for taxes paid on revenue decades ago, and no inflation allowance). Fuel burnt in operations is tax-deductible, and the taxman can read company accounts just like you and me. Do you really think BP is giving up 25% tax relief on 10% of it\u2019s operational costs, just for some less unkind PR? Piss-poor Big Bad Wolf if they are!It\u2019s a particularly pernicious myth because it leads people to believe there\u2019s a fortune out there that can fund decarbonisation at no cost to us. There isn\u2019t. I look out my window and see three SUVs and my hatchback. Did BP force my neighbours to buy cars half a ton heavier than mine? Personal responsibility cuts both ways, and all ways. Profits are a few dollars a barrel, it would take more like a $50 a barrel tax to make people change their habits.The big numbers that are thrown around (usually without attribution but I\u2019ll see if I can find the EU estimate which has the detail) is mainly consumer subsidies in OPEC countries, selling the product at less than market price, and a non-charged cost-of-carbon externality. Your carbon, my carbon, and granny in China\u2019s carbon. It includes carbon credits grandfathered to steel mills, and things like the government carrying the cost of nuclear waste disposal and nuclear accident risk, rather than the generators taking out private insurance. Even the low VAT the UK charges domestic energy consumers is counted as a subsidy to the energy industry, as is the green levy charged to consumers to pay for subsidised wind and solar contracts. O&G shareholders don\u2019t get a penny of that.There is no free lunch courtesy of Shell or BP. We, consumers, will have to pay and change our habits. That\u2019s a feature not a bug.

How well we internalized the message \u2013 is illustrated when Dave, a good-will, reasonable, educated man, seems to have swallowed the BP\u2019s argument, hook. line and sinker \u2013 presents it here as his own views (see above) and even take\u2019s BP argument \u2026. further: Dave_Geologist: \u201cWhy not sue [\u2026] Indian villagers burning cow dung?\u201d even though these Indian villagers, unlike BP, Exon, Saudi Arabia or Russia, don\u2019t make \u2026 $ billions or trillions from that, nor the \u201ccow dung\u201d is \u2026 even a \u201cfossil fuel\u201d.

The now-controversial UK scheme was a net positive to the taxman (relief now for taxes paid on revenue decades ago, and no inflation allowance).

The Greenpeace case was heard in North Dakota an oil state so the Jury would be very sympathetic to the pipeline company. They also sued Greenpeace for defamation and orchestrating a criminally behaved protest and this has nothing to do with the Peruvian farmer claiming that the fossil fuels companies emissions has caused him damage. \u201cInternational Law is about the same as it was 2500 years ago in the Melian Dialogue \u2013\u201cthe strong do what they will and the weak suffer what they must.\u201d Not really.

Nigeljsays 24 Mar 2025 at 3:30 PM Don Williams \u201cMy impression is that China would dismiss the Peruvian farmer\u2019s suit and the same is likely here in the USA\u2014a US jury just hit Greenpeace with a $660 Million penalty for protests against the Dakota Access Pipeline.\u201d The Greenpeace example is not a great comparison. The Greenpeace case was heard in North Dakota an oil state so the Jury would be very sympathetic to the pipeline company. They also sued Greenpeace for defamation and orchestrating a criminally behaved protest and this has nothing to do with the Peruvian farmer claiming that the fossil fuels companies emissions has caused him damage. \u201cInternational Law is about the same as it was 2500 years ago in the Melian Dialogue \u2013\u201cthe strong do what they will and the weak suffer what they must.\u201d Not really. Public complainents have won many victories against large corporates. This must really annoy you. \u201c2) What is not often mentioned is the vital benefits the fossil fuel industry has provided in the past \u2013 the energy necessary to grow food, transport food to cities, heat homes in winter, provide water, etc. Plus the energy needed to prevail in war. \u201d The peruvian case might come down to weighing costs and benefits and that will be very difficult but not impossible. However personally I dont think we should be trying to solve the climate problem by lawsuits. \u201cHence I think national legislatures should be responsible for the decisions on energy policy and I think they will tend to give fossil fuel companies immunity for past emissions. \u201d Even the fascist leaning trump might be reluctant to give immunity because it would destroy the whole purpose of civil law. \u201cThe Green Party in Germany only won 13.5% of the votes in the recent election and Germany is struggling with energy shortages. Plus I haven\u2019t seen any EU army proposing to field solar-powered \u2013or solar smelted \u2014 army tanks, missiles and jet fighters against the Russians and Chinese \u2014 although one should never discount the EU\u2019s \u2026.er ..eccentricity.\u201d The German grid uses renewable energy and that electricity is used in arms manufacture mixed in with electricity from non renewable sources. One day it will be all renewables. To the manufacturing process its all the same electricity.

Dave_Geologistsays24 Mar 2025 at 1:03 PMFrom what I can glean German Law is based mainly on Byzantine Law, which was based on Roman Law.That has a concept of \u201cvincible ignorance\u201d \u2013 should have known, ignorance is no defence, guilty; and \u201cinvincible ignorance\u201d \u2013 couldn\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t have known, ignorance is a defence, innocent.Scotland has a mixed Common/Roman Law system and the offence of Culpable and Reckless Conduct (a sub-category of which is Reckless Endangerment, which I\u2019ve heard often enough in crime shows to persuade me that at least some US States have it too). Interestingly England doesn\u2019t, despite being a Common Law system like the USA. There have been some high-profile cases where it was obvious someone \u201cshould\u201d have been prosecuted and convicted but got off because there was no intent (there are no-intent convictions, but there has to be an associated crime such as a robbery, or a breach of HSE, traffic, etc. regulations).In the Scottish legal definitions, \u201crecklessness\u201d has to go beyond the normal everyday usage, basically beyond what a reasonable person would do. And the harm doesn\u2019t have to actually happen, potential harm is enough, although I presume the penalty is less for the latter.Assuming most jurisdictions have something similar (it\u2019s such an obvious loophole otherwise that I would expect Statute or Case Law would have seen the need to encompass it), \u201cdidn\u2019t know\u201d would be a likely pre-1995 defence (reasonable people could have said \u201cWhat if there\u2019s missing physics, wait until the signal emerges above the noise.\u201d). \u201cDon\u2019t believe it\u201d obviously not, unless there were reasonable grounds for not believing it, which doesn\u2019t apply to AGW and its impact on glaciers.
