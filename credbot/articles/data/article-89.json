Psychoanalytic psychotherapy uses psychoanalytic theories as the frame for formulation and understanding of the therapy process. These multiple theories apply to the psychotherapy situation, with a focus on increasing self understanding and deepening insight into emotional issues and conflicts which underlie the presenting difficulties. Typically therapists make use of exploration of unconscious thoughts and feelings, understanding aspects of the relationship between therapist and patient, which may relate to underlying emotional conflicts, interpretation of defensive processes which obstruct emotional awareness, and consideration of issues related to sense of self and self esteem. Most often therapy sessions occur between one and four times weekly. The focus is on exploration of the patient\u2019s inner experience, emphasizing this as it occurs in current daily life, as it carries over from significant and influential events and relationships of the past, and as it is manifest in the context of the therapeutic relationship. The efficacy of psychoanalytic psychotherapy, often referred to as psychodynamic psychotherapy, has been well documented. Current research indicates this as a powerfully curative treatment.
