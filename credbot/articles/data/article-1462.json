With their graduation earlier in the day adding another layer of finality to Tuesday\u2019s PIAA Class 2A boys volleyball first round game against York Suburban, the Crusaders tried for a major upset but settled on a bit of history. The state-ranked Trojans proved formidable in winning three straight sets only after LC had done something it never had prior. York Suburban claimed the match 3-1 (22-25, 25-11, 28-26, 25-16) while the Crusaders won their first-ever set in a state playoff match. \u201cEarlier in the season, most times in a match like this, we\u2019d just fold but I\u2019m just proud of each and every one of my teammates,\u201d LC senior libero Jordan Miller said. \u201cWe went down swinging. We left it all on the court and to know that\u2019s the way we\u2019re going out, that makes me happy. I can go out with that.\u201d The Trojans, who were ranked No. 4 in the state in Class 2A by the PA Volleyball Coaches Association\u2019s most recent poll, are a program that expects to contend for District III titles if not state titles on a yearly basis. Lansdale Catholic isn\u2019t on that level yet and boys volleyball as a whole hasn\u2019t quite reached the level in southeastern PA as it has in the mid-state but the Crusaders have made notable growth recently. Take the Crusaders\u2019 nine seniors for example. Prior to their freshman year, none of them had played competitive volleyball and in Tuesday\u2019s match, two of the senior starters were first-year volleyball players. They\u2019ll leave having helped LC win the PCL title in 2024 \u2013 the school\u2019s first Catholic League title in any boys\u2019 team sport \u2013 win its first set in the state playoffs and with a PCL MVP thanks to outside hitter Sean Carr taking home the honors this season. \u201cIt\u2019s not the result we wanted with a loss but these guys are my family,\u201d Carr said. \u201cThey\u2019re my best friends here and to go out fighting against a great team like that, to fight in that first and third set how we did, it\u2019s amazing and I\u2019m never going to forget that.\u201d York Suburban scored the first point of the match, but LC responded with the next two. Carr knocked down a kill for a 3-2 lead in the first set the Crusaders wouldn\u2019t give up, the senior adding another point on a block on the next rally. The Trojans hung around but a pair of three-point bursts by LC, the first started on a side-out kill by Carr helped the hosts at arm\u2019s reach. Carr, seniors Shaun Emmerich and Kevin Montagna and sophomore Gavin Moore all had key points as LC took the set 25-22 and accomplished something no other Crusaders group had. \u201cTo have this group of guys who have played four years and to see it culminate with a state set win was really nice for our seniors to have,\u201d LC coach Rachel Picozzi said. \u201cWe\u2019re a very unassuming, small school in Lansdale but we have some big competitors and big athletes and I think coming out that way in the first set really showed the framework of what these guys are and what they can be.\u201d The Trojans looked every bit the state-ranked squad they are in the second set, using a 9-0 scoring run to take a 13-3 lead on their way to a lopsided win to even the match. Much of their production came off the arm of junior outside hitter Trent Weinstein, who knocked down seven kills in the second set and 23 overall on the night. With Truett Miller also swinging well on the outside and the Trojan defense flying around the court, LC had to fight for every point. Picozzi explained York Suburban\u2019s offensive tempo was level higher than most of the competition the Crusaders had seen during the year and coupled with some dynamic hitters, it made slowing the Trojans \u2013 especially Weinstein \u2013 down more difficult once they got going. \u201cHe did a really good job of getting around our block,\u201d Miller said. \u201cThere were times where he would jump, our block would jump and come down and he would just hang up there. We have a couple guys that it\u2019s their first time playing volleyball so there\u2019s a little bit of inexperience but they did everything they could up there, he just played a fantastic game.\u201d Carr and Miller both chalked up the team\u2019s closeness as a significant part of its success this spring. The seniors particularly had come a long way from having no volleyball experience as freshman to having a league title as part of their legacy. Miller, who is attending West Chester and hopes to play club volleyball there, was effusive in his praise of all his teammates including first-year players Tim O\u2019Brien and Peter Cusumano and made special note of Montagna, who has committed to play at Penn State-Altoona next year. Carr added that even though his class is leaving, he hopes to see the program continue adding more firsts like the Crusaders did the last two years. \u201cWe played for each other, that\u2019s what it was,\u201d Carr, who is attending the University of Maryland and also hoping to play club, said. \u201cThis is our first ever state set win, so to make history like that, it\u2019s something we get to carry with us and you\u2019ve gotta feel good about it.\u201d This LC group also developed plenty of resiliency. With York Suburban looking at set point holding a 24-22 lead in the third set, the Crusaders staved off the end of the match four times before finally going down 28-26 in an extended frame. It was the kind of fight that Picozzi has seen become the normal with this group, one she listed among her all-time favorites to have coached. Whether it was Sean Williamson coming in to serve or Sean Patrick Walsh and Anthony Riccio playing different spots, all of the seniors had a part in the team identity. \u201cThey\u2019re a great group of athletes who just want to compete,\u201d Picozzi said. \u201cThey will do whatever it takes to get to that point. They knew this was their last time playing in this gym, win or lose, and coming off graduation today, I told them to fight for every single point and it\u2019s a testament to who they are.\u201d The Crusaders will have a very different looking team next year. Moore, who was tremendous late in that third set, is the only returning starter although Carr said there are some promising younger players coming up and Miller added his younger brother is planning to play next year when he gets to LC. \u201cIt goes by quickly,\u201d Carr said. \u201cYou wish you could do it all over again, play a little harder here and there but it\u2019s the lessons you learn along the way that make you see that.\u201d Lansdale Catholic didn\u2019t get the match win on Tuesday, but a significant senior class left their gym for the last time knowing they\u2019d left all they had to give within its walls. \u201cI trust every single one of my teammates with my whole heart, I would go to war for them,\u201d Miller said. \u201cThey would say the same thing about everybody else and that\u2019s what sets us apart. This isn\u2019t just a team, it\u2019s a family.\u201d **Share this:** Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Facebook Click to share on X (Opens in new window)X **RevContent Feed** **Most Popular** Norristown High School graduation honors immigration as opportunity through sacrifice [Photos]Norristown High School graduation honors immigration as opportunity through sacrifice [Photos] **Norristown High School graduation honors immigration as opportunity through sacrifice [Photos]** **Norristown High School graduation honors immigration as opportunity through sacrifice [Photos]** Limerick man convicted of stalking, harassing girl he met in high schoolLimerick man convicted of stalking, harassing girl he met in high school **Limerick man convicted of stalking, harassing girl he met in high school** **Limerick man convicted of stalking, harassing girl he met in high school** PIAA-5A BASEBALL: Upper Dublin outduels Elizabethtown in 8 innings to reach state finalPIAA-5A BASEBALL: Upper Dublin outduels Elizabethtown in 8 innings to reach state final **PIAA-5A BASEBALL: Upper Dublin outduels Elizabethtown in 8 innings to reach state final** **PIAA-5A BASEBALL: Upper Dublin outduels Elizabethtown in 8 innings to reach state final** Hundreds rally in Norristown to support immigrants in face of ICE uptickHundreds rally in Norristown to support immigrants in face of ICE uptick **Hundreds rally in Norristown to support immigrants in face of ICE uptick** **Hundreds rally in Norristown to support immigrants in face of ICE uptick** Wawa to open newest Montgomery County storeWawa to open newest Montgomery County store **Wawa to open newest Montgomery County store** **Wawa to open newest Montgomery County store** Norristown teen accused in gunshot slaying seeks court-appointed lawyerNorristown teen accused in gunshot slaying seeks court-appointed lawyer **Norristown teen accused in gunshot slaying seeks court-appointed lawyer** **Norristown teen accused in gunshot slaying seeks court-appointed lawyer** Former Penn Christian Academy administrator charged with $579,000 theftFormer Penn Christian Academy administrator charged with $579,000 theft **Former Penn Christian Academy administrator charged with $579,000 theft** **Former Penn Christian Academy administrator charged with $579,000 theft** Andrew Painter struggles in 2nd consecutive start;
