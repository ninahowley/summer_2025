By morning, architectural designs of ADUS were seen tattooed on the backs of inmates. Marc Elrich, who has long opposed increasing housing density in Montgomery County, expressed sorrow over the mix-up while also appearing remarkably chill about the overall outcome. \u201cYes, it\u2019s unfortunate that the permits are now integrated into a prison gang economy,\u201d said Elrich, \u201cbut we have to accept that these things happen. My hands are tied. And not just figuratively \u2013 these applications are now technically members of MS-13.\u201d Asked why his office had not made an effort to retrieve the lost permits, Elrich sighed deeply. \u201cLook, once an R-60 zoning variance gets a neck tattoo and joins a gang called \u2018YIMBYs,\u2019 it\u2019s pretty much a wrap.\u201d Back in the prison, one high-ranking inmate with a full-sleeve tattoo of the Takoma Metro Development said he now controls most of the affordable housing stock from inside his cell. \u201cWe run this market now,\u201d he said. \u201cTell Marc Elrich if he wants these permits back, he\u2019ll have to upzone.\u201d **Share this story** Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Facebook Click to share on X (Opens in new window)X Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)Reddit Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Pinterest Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Tumblr Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)LinkedIn **Discover more from The Takoma Torch** Subscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.
