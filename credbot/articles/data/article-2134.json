Patriot Pickle,acquired by Miami-based investment firmH.I.G. Capital, has opened a new production facility in Garland, Texas, more than tripling its manufacturing capacity and creating an estimated 75 jobs. The move represents a significant shift for the New Jersey-based company as it builds a national production network designed to shorten delivery times and expand market reach. The expansion comes amid growingconsumerdemand for specialty food items and increasing pressure on food manufacturers to reduce distribution times while maintaining product freshness. Industry analysts suggest regional production facilities like Patriot\u2019s new Texas operation help companies navigate rising transportation costs while meeting retailer demands for faster replenishment. \u201cThe opening of a new production facility in Garland is a major step forward for Patriot Pickle,\u201d said Bill McEntee, the company\u2019s founder, and Adam Ricci, its chief executive officer, in a joint statement. \u201cWe\u2019re eager to work with the Garland community as we invest in and grow the local economy.\u201d Founded in 2004,Patriot Picklehas built its business serving restaurant chains, food service distributors, supermarkets and delis, with a product portfolio ranging from kosher dill pickles to specialty items like sweet horseradish chips and pickled green tomatoes. The company operates under multiple brands, including Patriot Pickle, Crisp, Regal Crown, K&Z, and First Place Foods. The Texas facility, constructed over nine months, will enable the company to deliver fresh pickles from \u201cfarm to package\u201d within five days nationwide \u2014 a significant logistical achievement in the specialty foods sector, where shelf life and product freshness remain critical competitive factors. The expansion follows a period of rapid consolidation in the specialty foods industry, with private equity firms taking particular interest in food manufacturers with strong regional footprints and expansion potential. H.I.G. Capital, which manages approximately $67 billion in capital, acquired Patriot Pickle from Swander Pace Capital, another private equity firm that had owned the company since April 2021. \u201cThe Company has experienced significant growth since it was founded two decades ago and is now poised for major expansion with the opening of this new, state-of-the-art facility,\u201d said Justin Reyna, managing director at H.I.G. Capital. Patriot\u2019s expansion strategy mirrors similar moves by mid-sized food manufacturers seeking to establish regional production hubs that can reduce transportation costs while improving service to national accounts. With approximately 185,000 square feet of production space now split between its New Jersey headquarters and the new Texas facility, the company has positioned itself to compete more effectively against both larger national brands and smaller regional producers. The company maintains SQF Level 2 and HAACP certifications, industry standards that allow it to serve major retail and foodservice accounts. Patriot Pickle also operates under Orthodox Union supervision, enabling it to serve kosher markets. The investment in Garland represents part of a broader trend of food manufacturing expansion in Texas, where favorable business conditions, central location, and strong transportation infrastructure have attracted numerous specialty food producers in recent years. **Post navigation** **Trending Now** Milk and Dairy Deliveries: Reviving the Retro Twist What If You Don\u2019t Calibrate Your Equipment?
