Imagine an emergency physician, the epitome of calm under pressure, feeling the weight of unrelenting stress. This is doctor burnout, and certain physician specialties have become particularly vulnerable to this pervasive problem, according to an exclusive survey from the AMA. Get more from the AMA ViewAMA membership options Discover greatmember benefits Find CMEfrom AMA Ed Hub\u2122 Get involved inAMA sections As the leader in physician well-being, the AMA isreducing physician burnoutby removing administrative burdens and providing real-world solutions to help doctors rediscover theJoy in Medicine\u2122. More than 12,400 responses from physicians across 31 states were received from 81 health systems and organizations who participated in theAMA Organizational Biopsy\u00aelast year. The AMA national physician comparison report\u2014which is exclusive data to the AMA that is not published anywhere else\u2014reflects 2023 trends in six key performance indicators: job satisfaction, job stress, burnout, intent to leave an organization, feeling valued by an organization and total hours spent per week on work-related activities (known as \u201ctime spend\u201d). The purpose of the aggregated data is to provide a national summary of organizational well-being and to serve as a comparison for other health care organizations. The results may be limited by the health systems that chose to participate. In 2023, 48.2% of physicians reported experiencing at least one symptom of burnout,down from 53% in 2022. For the most stressful medical job in 2023, the highest percentages of burnout occurred in six physician specialties. They are: Emergency medicine: 56.5%\u2014down from 62%. Internal medicine: 51.4%\u2014down from 52%. Obstetrics and gynecology: 51.2%\u2014down from 54%. Family medicine: 51%\u2014down from 58%. Pediatrics: 46.9%\u2014down from 55%. Hospital medicine: 44%\u2014down from 59%. Meanwhile, just 48.7% of pediatrician respondents reported feeling valued by their organization, down from 52% in 2022. While pediatricians saw a drop in feeling valued, ob-gyns saw a rise in this metric moving from 40% to 51.6%. Family doctors and internists both fell below 50% on that metric. At Texas Children\u2019s Pediatrics, the percentage of pediatricians who reported burnout was well below the national average. Texas Children\u2019s Pediatrics is a member of theAMA Health System Program, which provides enterprise solutions to equip leadership, physicians and care teams with resources to help drive the future of medicine. Here is howTexas Children\u2019s Pediatricshas addressed physician burnout and worked to improve job satisfaction among pediatricians. **Your Powerful Ally** The AMA is your powerful ally, focused on addressing the issues important to you, so you can focus on what matters most\u2014patients. We will meet this challenge together. **Organize a well-being committee** Two years ago, Texas Children\u2019s Pediatrics organized an engagement and well-being committee. This physician-led committee aims to address concerns that pediatricians have. \u201cWe\u2019ve assessed burnout across the system twice now. We just completed our second assessment this past March and we saw improvement,\u201d said Sapna Singh, MD, a pediatrician and director of physician engagement and wellness at Texas Children's Pediatrics. \u201cOur distress scores dropped by 36% from 2023 to 2024, and our thriving scores improved by almost 14%.\u201d \u201cSome of it may be just COVID being a little further away in our rearview mirror, but I\u2019d like to say that we can take some credit,\u201d she said, noting \u201cthe committee\u2019s work has helped allow us to have a discussion about what physicians need at every level of the organization and that\u2019s critical to being able to tackle burnout. \u201cYou can\u2019t just form a committee and then go out and give people cupcakes and meditation classes. You need to go in and have the Epic team work on how we can improve EHR inefficiencies our operations team is working on,\u201d Dr. Singh said. The committee also looks at \u201chow does our staff support the work of the clinical team better? ... How can leadership come in and support us when we need help with supplies, equipment, scheduling, online resources that we might need assistance with?\u201d **Get the latest news on physician well-being** Subscribe for insights and real-world solutions delivered straight to your inbox. **Reducing administrative burden** Texas Children\u2019s Pediatrics has started investing in a pilot for virtual scribes to address the administrative burden faced by pediatricians, \u201cwhich is a huge bane of our existence,\u201d said Dr. Singh. Another way Texas Children\u2019s Pediatrics is reducing documentation burden is withaugmented intelligence(AI), often called artificial intelligence. \u201cWe\u2019re working on AI responses for inbox messages to help with the 300,000 messages that we receive in our portal,\u201d Dr. Singh said, noting these will now be assisted with the AI tool and will \u201cstill be viewed and answered by a physician, but we will have the assistance of AI in being able to get back to patients more quickly.\u201d Additionally, Texas Children\u2019s Pediatrics has rolled out an app to help patients after hours and on weekends. The app \u201chelps them go through a symptom checker, helps them assess when they need to come in, when do they need to make an appointment,\u201d Dr. Singh said. \u201cA lot of that is taking some of those questions and messages off our plate so that we can spend more time doing what we love, which is the face-to-face interactions in the clinic.\u201d \u201cThe work that the committee has put in has helped us have conversations across the organization so that we\u2019re now making decisions based on what\u2019s going to provide quality patient care and not increase stress and workload on the physicians and clinical team,\u201d she said. **Show you\u2019re invested** While their well-being work was not done for recognition, for the first time this year Texas Children\u2019s Pediatrics applied for theAMA Joy in Medicine Health System Recognition Program. \u201cWe followed theJoy in Medicine road mapand it was really pleasantly surprising. We had actually done a lot of the work that the road map was asking for, even prior to looking at that and using that as a guiding format for what we wanted to accomplish,\u201d Dr. Singh said. \u201cThat recognition would be wonderful because it helps people see we\u2019re invested, and we really do want to help physicians do better.\u201d \u201cThe program that the AMA has put together is really fantastic, especially if you\u2019re an organization that\u2019s just getting started,\u201d she said. \u201cThat road map is a really good way to work through the system level things that are really causing burnout.\u201d **Maintain open communication** \u201cThe most important thing is that we\u2019ve got to really listen to our clinical care teams \u2026 to provide quality patient care, which should be everybody\u2019s priority,\u201d Dr. Singh said. \u201cThe people who take care of those patients day in and day out really need to have a voice.\u201d \u201cAnd anybody who doesn\u2019t take that seriously is probably going to have more issues with burnout and attrition within their system,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat our organization has done really well is we\u2019ve opened up the conversation, we\u2019ve got avenues for feedback and discussion and on top of that, we have action. \u201cPeople are taking action on ideas that we\u2019ve asked for. We\u2019re not at the end by any means yet and there are a lot of other factors that contribute to this that aren\u2019t in our control,\u201d Dr. Singh added. \u201cBut at the end of the day, pediatricians have a lot to offer.\u201d Combat physician burnout Event: American Conference on Physician Health (ACPH) Sept. 11-13, 2025, focusing on steps organizations can take to improve physician well-being CME: How health systems can reduce physician burnout Calculate: See the cost of physician burnout to your organization Video: Latest trends in physician burnout by specialty Playbook: Wellness-centered leadership **Table of Contents** Organize a well-being committee Reducing administrative burden Show you\u2019re invested Maintain open communication Physician Well-being & Burnout Texas Children's Pediatrics Choosing a Specialty Health Care AI Administrative Simplification Electronic Health Records (EHR) Joy in Medicine\u2122 Health System Recognition Program Emergency Medicine Internal Medicine Fighting for Physicians Catalog of Topics **FEATURED STORIES** **AMA president: Doctors must turn discontent into decisive action** **AMA president: Doctors must turn discontent into decisive action** **What\u2019s wrong with Medicare physician payment?** **What\u2019s wrong with Medicare physician payment?** **The AMA steps up its efforts to fix prior authorization** **The AMA steps up its efforts to fix prior authorization** **In burnout work, take care with physicians\u2019 personal health data** **In burnout work, take care with physicians\u2019 personal health data** Physician burnout rate drops below 50% for...
