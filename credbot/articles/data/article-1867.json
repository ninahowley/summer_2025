Nelson. \u201cThis is the natural, unstoppable evolution of the parental empowerment movement sparked amid the pandemic lockdowns. The states are ready for it, and they\u2019ve been clamoring for it. This executive order is a fundamental step forward in the American education revolution. We fully support President Trump\u2019s leadership in eliminating wasteful, bureaucratic mandates that push political agendas and divert taxpayer funds away from students. By putting the states back in charge of this funding, students, families, and teachers will be put first \u2013 rather than the bloated bureaucracy in Washington, DC.\u201d A constant theme of President Trump\u2019s 2024 campaign, the dissolution of the Department of Education will restore decision-making power over America\u2019s schools to the states. This move aims to eliminate costly federal bureaucracy, reduce inefficiencies, and refocus education policy on local needs\u2014ultimately improving student outcomes. On March 11, 2025, the ALEC Board of Directors officially adopted a model resolution endorsing this move. Read the ALEC Model Resolution Supporting Devolution of Power from the U.S. Department of Education to the States. \u201cALEC believes that policymakers should empower parents, not government bureaucrats, to direct their child\u2019s education,\u201d said West Virginia Senator and ALEC National Chair Patricia Rucker. \u201cFor decades, the U.S. Department of Education has steadily increased red tape and imposed one-size-fits-all mandates that neglect the unique needs of individual students. ALEC fully supports President Trump\u2019s mission to end this wasteful bureaucracy and return education authority back to where it belongs \u2013 the states.\u201d Today, ALEC alsolaunched a coalition and state legislator letter campaignadvocating for the dissolution of the Department of Education, inviting its 2,000+ members to sign. This initiative builds on ALEC\u2019s track record of successful legislative letter campaigns, including letters in support of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) as well as a letter supporting Israel and condemning the Hamas terrorist massacre on October 7, 2023. Read the new ALEC letter. \u201cThe U.S. Department of Education has overseen decades of stagnation in student achievement,\u201d said Pennsylvania State Representative and ALEC Education & Workforce Development Task Force Chair Barbara Gleim. \u201cSince the Nation\u2019s Report Card began tracking 4th and 8th grade reading scores in 1992, average performance has declined by two points despite the department spending over $1 trillion. ALEC\u2019s Education & Workforce Development Task Force strongly supports President Trump and Secretary McMahon\u2019s bold efforts to dismantle this ineffective agency and restore control to states and parents, where it belongs.\u201d Published:March 20, 2025 Issues:Education Categories:Education,Press Releases White House Issues New Executive Orders on K-12, Higher Education, and Workforce DevelopmentThis week, President Trump signed a series of executive orders (EOs) addressing numerous aspects of K-12 and higher education.
