This demonstrates that many are not satisfied with the options from the two major parties, and that what once seemed a giveaway now has some hope. The Libertarian ticket seemed to mostly be for maintaining this election cycle, but with continued dislike of incumbent Donald Trump and the multiple gaffs by Democratic nominee Joe Biden, a third party candidate could make a considerable dent this year. Incumbent presidents tend to win their reelections, only 10 presidents being the exception, but Trump has steadilymaintaineda disapproval rating of over 50%, and Biden has consistently hadunfavorable ratings. Hopefully, this early success marks the beginning of continued consideration for the Libertarian ticket. **Share this:** Click to share on X (Opens in new window)X Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Facebook Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window)Telegram Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Tumblr Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)LinkedIn Click to share on Pocket (Opens in new window)Pocket Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)Reddit Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window)Email Click to print (Opens in new window)Print **Like this:** TAGS 2020 election 2020 presidential election election 2020 Jo Jorgensen libertarian party **Ron Paul Revolution Takes Over The Libertarian Party** **Secession: The Lost Aspect of Federalism** **Sympathy & Empathy & Hierarchy** Robert the LibertarianJune 17, 2020 at 6:42 pmLibertarian Poll Data on Facebook, the voice of the founders and leaders of world Libertarianism, have called this a \u2018fun poll\u2019 and beauty contest because it doesn\u2019t meet science standards.

WmJune 26, 2020 at 3:48 amJo Jorgensen helped double the membership of the Libertarian Party when she ran in 1996 as VP candidate of the LP. She could win this year drawing from both major parties and from independents. It will be crucial for Jorgensen to be included in the three presidential debates. Both major parties have excluded third party candidates from debates but if someone is on sufficient number of ballots to theoretically win in the Electoral College, most people think that should make them eligible for entry in the debates not the arbitrary 15% in selected polls demanded by the GOP and Dems.Jorgensen is articulate, educated, knowledgeable and motivated as a proponent of libertarian solutions to the problems facing our country. She should and could win this election and that would spare us the outcome of the failed policies of either major party which have brought us to this condition of failed public schools, failed public trade policies and foreign entanglements, exorbitant spending programs and giveaways with unsustainable national debt and destruction of the dollar.GOP and Dems pay lip service to the Constitution but ignore it whereas Jorgensen will restore the limits the Founders granted and enumerated in order to restrain government and assure individual freedom which enabled the country to prosper with abolition of slavery.

Honestly this is about as reliable as a FB or Twitter poll. I purposely artificially inflated Jo\u2019s numbers just to see if I could do it.. wasn\u2019t hard at all.

This poll, like most Libertarians are posting right now, could just as easily show Boaty McBoatface in the lead. It\u2019s the internet. If you want Jo to get traction you need to convince real people to vote for her.Also, Robert, no poll meets science standards. You can apply rigorous methods but it still isn\u2019t science. Please.

KarenJuly 20, 2020 at 11:51 amI vote Boaty McBoatface! I vote Boaty McBoatface! I vote Boaty McBoatface! risquedjJuly 27, 2020 at 8:23 amThink about who is conducting this poll. They don\u2019t want to advance the Libertarian agenda. They want Libertarians to take votes away from Trump. Listen, I have NEVER played the \u201clesser of two evils\u201d game, but this election, that\u2019s exactly what I am going to do. As much as it pains me to say it, I will be voting for Trump. Radical Socialists are making a BIG push, and they have the ear (and some of the minds) of the elite within the Democratic Party. A vote for Biden is not a vote for the status quo Democratic agenda, but one that is MUCH MORE radical!! Let\u2019s put it this way, I don\u2019t feel like Trump could destroy our Republic in the next 4 years, but I think this radical Leftist agenda could. It\u2019s for that reason I am voting Trump. Then in 2024, I will be amongst the loudest people pushing the end of the two-party system via Libertarian principles again. Not that I wouldn\u2019t continue to hold Trump to those same standards as well. Think about who is conducting this poll. They don\u2019t want to advance the Libertarian agenda.
