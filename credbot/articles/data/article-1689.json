Science writing itself still reflects this trend today with awkward passive phrasing such as \u201cit is shown\u201d or \u201cit was found,\u201d rather than \u201cI show\u201d or \u201cwe show.\u201d There is, of course, in any attempt to be objective a pretense of there not being a person making the statements at issue. But there is in factalwaysa person, a scientist, doing the science. In this manner, science is inherently and irrevocably subjective, not objective. Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger, one of the key architects of quantum mechanics in the early part of the 20thCentury, labeled this approach in 1954 the \u201cprinciple of objectivation\u201d and expressed it clearly: By [the principle of objectivation] I mean \u2026 a certain simplification which we adopt in order to master the infinitely intricate problem of nature. Without being aware of it and without being rigorously systematic about it, we exclude the subject of cognizance from the domain of nature that we endeavor to understand. We step with our own person back into the part of an onlooker who does not belong to the world, which by this very procedure becomes an objective world. This practice, of \u201cbeing objective,\u201d is part of what I call in this column \u201cold empiricism.\u201d It\u2019s a way of doing science that pretends there isn\u2019t inherently a person doing the science. And in this manner, the simplicity that objectivation once afforded is now outweighed by the confusion that the pretense leads to. Now that science is firmly engaged in examining consciousness itself\u2014ashiftfrom even a couple of decades ago when it wasn\u2019t considered very scientific to engage in such studies\u2014it is time to drop the pretense and face the subjective realm head on. One of the key tasks of today\u2019s science is how to resolve, scientifically, the classic mind/body problem. The mind/body problem is all about establishing the relationship between objective/external reality and subjective/internal reality. A good example of what I mean by old empiricism is Sean Carroll\u2019s argument, in his 2010 book,From Eternity to Here, for entropy as the explanation for the observed arrow of time we see in the universe around us and in our daily lives. The arrow of time is considered a problem because many of our physical theories suggest that there is no inherent direction or arrow to time. So why do we remember the past and imagine the future? Carroll explicitly leaves out any substantial discussion of the psychological flow of time or questions of consciousness or first-person empiricism in his book. He starts, rather, with the traditional \u201cobjectivist\u201d viewpoint that has defined modern science for some time. He raises the question of the psychological passage of time as an issue in physics but then says that he\u2019s not going to address it. But addressing the experienced passage of time is as much a physics question as anything else in physics, and is perhaps fundamental to the nature of reality and thus to physics. We can\u2019t ignore this issue if we are to have a more complete physical understanding of the world. My feeling is that modern science, while it has achieved tremendous gains in human knowledge, is in some ways running out of steam in our attempts to tackle the remaining \u201cbig questions,\u201d and this is largely because of this historical commitment to \u201cobjectivation.\u201d It\u2019s time to expand our scientific methods to include the half of nature\u2014subjectivity\u2014that were explicitly left out of many areas of science in order to simplify our approach. It is time to correct that simplification by seeking a more complete account of nature that includes the subject. This expansion in our scientific perspective is what I call \u201cnew empiricism.\u201d **\u201cNew Empiricism\u201d** The new empiricism I\u2019m suggesting relies on first-person experience as the primary form of empiricism, recognizing that all experimental evidence is ultimately first-person experience. Experiments using physical equipment are ultimately first-person experience because there is no data, no information, without a human apprehending such data. But simple experience independent of any physical equipment is also data available to science. All experience is data. The second important point contained in the new empiricism I\u2019m advocating here is the need to take primary experience more seriously than has been the case for the last couple of hundred years. Where our physical theories clash with primary level empiricism\u2014the direct evidence of our senses\u2014in most cases, the resolution should be to prefer the evidence of our senses over the experimental evidence. Where exactly we decide the dispute in each potential conflict is a matter of debate. We can offer an example where the evidence of our senses is indeed misleading: judging whether the earth is flat or round. In everyday experience the earth does seem flat and yet we have no problem accepting that this is an illusion resulting from the scale of our planet compared to our human scale. When we pull back from the surface of our planet, we can see very clearly that the planet is a sphere. It didn\u2019t even require that we get in an airplane or a spaceship to accept that the earth is round. Rather, theories and evidence gathered from various experiments convinced most people that the earth was round long before the era of mechanized flight. For example, Aristotle deduced that the Earth was round by observing that ships on the horizon disappeared hull first, then mast and sails. Other illusions of our normal experience include the feeling that the sun orbits the earth, when it is more accurate to say that the earth orbits the sun. Another obvious illusion of our senses is our brain\u2019s ability to fill in the blind spot in each of our eyes with the surrounding image, a phenomenon that arises from the evolutionary accident that our optical nerve goes through our retina rather than attaching to the back of the retina as in some other species. The filled-in field of our vision is entirely fabricated by the brain to match the area near the blind spot. But as we can see from the classic spot on a piece of paperexperiment, this trick of our brain can be misleading. There are a ton of illusions like this that have become apparent to modern science. It is no surprise, then, that the scientific pendulum may have swung too far toward the view that even fundamental aspects of our existence, like the passage of time, may in fact be an illusion. I\u2019ll discuss this particular \u201cillusion\u201d more below. **\u201cOld Empiricism\u201d** Old empiricism takes the implications of mathematical theories further than empirical facts should allow. For example, the various physical theories that take time to be symmetrical (as space is symmetrical) should be re-considered with great scrutiny in the light of the direct evidence of our senses and of our experiments that time seems to pass in one direction only, and that the subjective passage of time is real. Other than the reality of our own consciousness, there seems to be nothing else that we can know more firmly than the fact of the experienced flow of time, from moment to moment to moment. Another good example of what I am calling here \u201cold empiricism\u201d comes from Huw Price\u2019s 1996 book,Time\u2019s Arrow and Archimedes\u2019 Point: New Directions for the Physics of Time: This book is about the need to think about time\u2019s puzzles from a new viewpoint, a viewpointoutsidetime. One of my main themes is that physicists and philosophers tend to think about time from too close up. We ourselves are creatures in time, and this is reflected in many ordinary ways of thinking and talking about the world. This makes it very difficult to think about time in an objective way, because it is always difficult to tell whether what we think we see is just a product of our vantage point. Price\u2019s viewpoint is perhaps an extreme point of view because he is calling explicitly for a non-empirical point of view. He realizes that everything that we know and experience is, of course, within time, and yet he calls for science to ignore this obvious and direct empirical basis for science in creating a physics that is truly a \u201cview from no-when,\u201d to use Price\u2019s phrase. Price seems to get it exactly backwards in terms of his understanding of the relationship between the world and physical laws. He states: \u201c[W]hat is puzzling is why the physical world should be asymmetric in time at all, given that the underlying physical laws seem to be very largely symmetric.\u201d It should be an uncontroversial point that physical \u201claws\u201d are entirely human creations, derived specifically from empirical facts and deduction, not the other way around. So it shouldn\u2019t be at all puzzling that the physical world shows temporal asymmetry because if our physical laws are symmetric and the world is asymmetric then the physical laws are wrong or at least incomplete. The fact that someone of Price\u2019s stature can make such statements without seeing this problem illustrates the degree to which modern science and philosophy have strayed from empiricism and common sense. A good thought experiment for assessing whether our common sense view of a particular phenomenon is illusory in some manner is to zoom in and out on the phenomenon, literally or figuratively, just as we do in assessing whether or not the Earth is actually flat or round. When we zoom in and out with respect to the passage of time we can see that no matter how much we zoom in or out on any particular phenomenon there is always the passing of time. The phenomena observed are always changing in some manner no matter how close up we look at, say, cellular processes, or subatomic particles; similarly, no matter how far we zoom out, at far-away galaxy clusters, for example, we still see change and thus the passing of time. So it seems that empirically we have no evidence whatsoever to support the notion that the passage of time is illusory. Price and his co-thinkers are left arguing based on indirect evidence alone as follows: that our mathematical theories that explain much of the physical phenomena we see suggest in some manner that the passage of time isn\u2019t real because the time term (usually denoted simply \u201ct\u201d) can be reversed with no fundamental impact to the equations. But the direct evidence that shows the passage of time is real surely should outweigh the indirect evidence that suggests the opposite. Rather than take our mathematical theories as indirect evidence of the illusory nature of time, perhaps we should adjust our theories! **Time For A Change?** Luckily, Einstein, Price, Carroll and the many other physicists and philosophers who see time as illusory, face the opposing viewpoint from an increasing number of other scholars who see a strong need to re-establish the reality of the passage of time. Lee Smolin, a physicists with the Perimeter Institute in Canada, and Tim Maudlin, a philosopher with a strong background in physics, have both argued in recent years that conventional physics\u2019 rendering of time as somehow illusory is a major mis-step. Smolin has made his case in two recent books,Time Rebornand, with Roberto Mangabeira Unger,The Singular Universe and the Reality of Time. Tim Maudlin has argued his case in his book,The Metaphysics Within Physics, in the chapter called \u201cOn the passing of time.\u201d Stephen Hawking, perhaps the most pre-eminent physicist of our time, also provides some support for the \u201ctime is real\u201d camp. Hawkingstates: In the standard positivist approach to the philosophy of science, physical theories live rent free in a Platonic heaven of ideal mathematical models. That is, a model can be arbitrarily detailed and can contain an arbitrary amount of information without affecting the universes they describe. But we are not angels, who view the universe from the outside. Instead, we and our models are both part of the universe we are describing. These are not easy topics to get one\u2019s head around, but I highlight the issues surrounding the nature of time because the bottom line here is pretty clear: everything we see, experience and measure shows the passage of time. Once today\u2019s physics gets its head around that empirical reality we can start to really make headway on other thorny issues like the nature of consciousness and the mind/body problem. **Dive Deeper** Click below to watch a sneak peek of our brand new course!

I have a biology background (B.S.) and have read widely in science and the philosophy of science for over two decades. Did you read my article?Replyf1bert86says:10 years agoYour whole premise is wrong there is nothing wrong with the scientific method, the results alone speak for themselves.That aside, science does not ignore the fact that we as humans view the world from a subjective standpoint, it is more aware of this fact than anything else and it is why it stands to reason that we try to be as objective as we possibly can. Science is powerful because it has the ability to explain the natural world and make predictions about particular outcomes given a particular set of circumstances. We can only make observations about the world around us through our own vessel of flesh and blood in addition to the instrumentation that we use to make measurements and observations, this is just a fact we have to accept. Nothing is ever going to change that fact because we cannot judge the universe from the perspective of being in a vacuum, we have to be conscious of our inherent bias and try to minimise any kind of subjectivity that only interferes with our understanding of the natural world.Fortunately for us the power of science is in experimentation and all it takes for an idea to be discarded is for it to fail an experiment once. Thousands of different scientists who are all subject to their own bias run experiments thousands of times that produce repeatable results that we can see again and again, results which match our theoretical understanding of a particular phenomena. In cases that an experiment does not match our presupposed expectations we consider issues in our experimental method. If we find no problem then we call into question the initial idea that we once had, and perhaps through our investigations find a new more encompassing theory that accounts for the new observation. The most obvious and well cited example being where Newton\u2019s classical view of gravitation was overthrown by Einstein\u2019s model of general relativity.The point is that despite each of us viewing the world through our own lens we can collectively as humanity agree with our theory and observations more often than not because we try and minimise any subjectivity that we may be susceptible to. We aim to be our own hardest critic and when one scientist proposes a new idea then the rest of the scientific community will do it\u2019s best to try and knock the idea on it\u2019s head. We have to be our own harshest critic, and it is only through being critical of each others ideas that we can reduce subjectivity and make as accurate as is humanly possible theories of the world around us.Perhaps when the scientific method stops producing such fantastic results should we then consider an alternate method that might get us somewhere quicker. But until that time I think I\u2019ll stick with what you call \u201cold empiricism\u201d that has proven to be so successful thus far.ReplyTam Huntsays:10 years agoI don\u2019t disagree with much of what you wrote, but I\u2019m not sure that you read my article very closely. My key point is this: we are now at a point in the progress of science that we are facing some roadblocks on very tricky issues, including the nature of consciousness and the nature of time. I suggest that we will need, in order to find good scientific answers to these problems, to find a new balance between the subjective and the objective perspective. The pendulum has swung too far to the \u201cobjective\u201d and too much ignores the subjective, a point that springs off the Schr\u00f6dinger quote at the beginning of my article. Does that make sense?Interestingly, I\u2019m listening to Arthur Herman\u2019s The Cave and the Light right now, which is a great history of the conflict and competition between Platonic and Aristotelian ideas about science, philosophy and the nature of reality. I\u2019m calling for a return to a more Aristotelian view of science, which values observation and experience more than abstractions from experience (particularly where abstractions conflict with experience). The discussion in my article about the nature of time is a perfect example of Platonic thinking gone awry, in which abstractions about the possible nature of time are, by many thinkers today, seen as more valid guides to the true nature of time than our own experience. I\u2019m suggesting that we need to return to a more Aristotelian fact-based and experience-based perspective on science and philosophy.PS. I also am a visiting scholar in psychology at UC Santa Barbara and have regular dialogues with many of my colleagues about these issues. Here\u2019s a recent book chapter contribution by my colleague Prof. Jonathan Schooler at UCSB, the first half of which mirrors much of what I write in my article (and I\u2019m cited in the acknowledgements):http://open-mind.net/papers/bridging-the-objective-subjective-divide-towards-a-meta-perspective-of-science-and-experience/at_download/paperPDF.Replyf1bert86says:10 years agoMy background is in physics and I am a grad student in geophysics so I can\u2019t really comment on the problem of consciousness or philosophical interpretations but I do understand a little bit about time and science.The scientific method has led us to a very good understanding of time and how it works in our universe. Einsteins theory of general relativity explains how space and time are inextricably linked to one another, we have very strong experimental evidence that the theory is accurate and to this day it is our best model of space and it\u2019s relation with time in the Universe. We have no requirement for a new model except in the situation at the centre of a black hole where the theory breaks down. As a consequence of relativity, given where an object is positioned and moving in spacetime, and in it\u2019s relation to other objects in the Universe we know how it will experience time and can quantify this, further verifying the result by experiment. The fact that the equations have no real directionality has no implication as to whether time is real or not.

Science is powerful because it has the ability to explain the natural world and make predictions about particular outcomes given a particular set of circumstances. We can only make observations about the world around us through our own vessel of flesh and blood in addition to the instrumentation that we use to make measurements and observations, this is just a fact we have to accept. Nothing is ever going to change that fact because we cannot judge the universe from the perspective of being in a vacuum, we have to be conscious of our inherent bias and try to minimise any kind of subjectivity that only interferes with our understanding of the natural world.Fortunately for us the power of science is in experimentation and all it takes for an idea to be discarded is for it to fail an experiment once. Thousands of different scientists who are all subject to their own bias run experiments thousands of times that produce repeatable results that we can see again and again, results which match our theoretical understanding of a particular phenomena. In cases that an experiment does not match our presupposed expectations we consider issues in our experimental method. If we find no problem then we call into question the initial idea that we once had, and perhaps through our investigations find a new more encompassing theory that accounts for the new observation. The most obvious and well cited example being where Newton\u2019s classical view of gravitation was overthrown by Einstein\u2019s model of general relativity.The point is that despite each of us viewing the world through our own lens we can collectively as humanity agree with our theory and observations more often than not because we try and minimise any subjectivity that we may be susceptible to. We aim to be our own hardest critic and when one scientist proposes a new idea then the rest of the scientific community will do it\u2019s best to try and knock the idea on it\u2019s head. We have to be our own harshest critic, and it is only through being critical of each others ideas that we can reduce subjectivity and make as accurate as is humanly possible theories of the world around us.Perhaps when the scientific method stops producing such fantastic results should we then consider an alternate method that might get us somewhere quicker.

I\u2019m calling for a return to a more Aristotelian view of science, which values observation and experience more than abstractions from experience (particularly where abstractions conflict with experience). The discussion in my article about the nature of time is a perfect example of Platonic thinking gone awry, in which abstractions about the possible nature of time are, by many thinkers today, seen as more valid guides to the true nature of time than our own experience. I\u2019m suggesting that we need to return to a more Aristotelian fact-based and experience-based perspective on science and philosophy.PS. I also am a visiting scholar in psychology at UC Santa Barbara and have regular dialogues with many of my colleagues about these issues. Here\u2019s a recent book chapter contribution by my colleague Prof. Jonathan Schooler at UCSB, the first half of which mirrors much of what I write in my article (and I\u2019m cited in the acknowledgements):http://open-mind.net/papers/bridging-the-objective-subjective-divide-towards-a-meta-perspective-of-science-and-experience/at_download/paperPDF.Replyf1bert86says:10 years agoMy background is in physics and I am a grad student in geophysics so I can\u2019t really comment on the problem of consciousness or philosophical interpretations but I do understand a little bit about time and science.The scientific method has led us to a very good understanding of time and how it works in our universe. Einsteins theory of general relativity explains how space and time are inextricably linked to one another, we have very strong experimental evidence that the theory is accurate and to this day it is our best model of space and it\u2019s relation with time in the Universe. We have no requirement for a new model except in the situation at the centre of a black hole where the theory breaks down. As a consequence of relativity, given where an object is positioned and moving in spacetime, and in it\u2019s relation to other objects in the Universe we know how it will experience time and can quantify this, further verifying the result by experiment. The fact that the equations have no real directionality has no implication as to whether time is real or not. The philosophical implications of time as with quantum mechanics are the issue and can be discussed until the end of the universe but they have no weight onto the actual theory itself, it certainly doesn\u2019t require of us a new approach to the scientific method. If another model of time is required, I would be pretty shocked if it needed a new approach to the scientific method. Your whole premise is wrong there is nothing wrong with the scientific method, the results alone speak for themselves. That aside, science does not ignore the fact that we as humans view the world from a subjective standpoint, it is more aware of this fact than anything else and it is why it stands to reason that we try to be as objective as we possibly can. Science is powerful because it has the ability to explain the natural world and make predictions about particular outcomes given a particular set of circumstances. We can only make observations about the world around us through our own vessel of flesh and blood in addition to the instrumentation that we use to make measurements and observations, this is just a fact we have to accept. Nothing is ever going to change that fact because we cannot judge the universe from the perspective of being in a vacuum, we have to be conscious of our inherent bias and try to minimise any kind of subjectivity that only interferes with our understanding of the natural world. Fortunately for us the power of science is in experimentation and all it takes for an idea to be discarded is for it to fail an experiment once. Thousands of different scientists who are all subject to their own bias run experiments thousands of times that produce repeatable results that we can see again and again, results which match our theoretical understanding of a particular phenomena. In cases that an experiment does not match our presupposed expectations we consider issues in our experimental method. If we find no problem then we call into question the initial idea that we once had, and perhaps through our investigations find a new more encompassing theory that accounts for the new observation. The most obvious and well cited example being where Newton\u2019s classical view of gravitation was overthrown by Einstein\u2019s model of general relativity. The point is that despite each of us viewing the world through our own lens we can collectively as humanity agree with our theory and observations more often than not because we try and minimise any subjectivity that we may be susceptible to. We aim to be our own hardest critic and when one scientist proposes a new idea then the rest of the scientific community will do it\u2019s best to try and knock the idea on it\u2019s head. We have to be our own harshest critic, and it is only through being critical of each others ideas that we can reduce subjectivity and make as accurate as is humanly possible theories of the world around us. Perhaps when the scientific method stops producing such fantastic results should we then consider an alternate method that might get us somewhere quicker. But until that time I think I\u2019ll stick with what you call \u201cold empiricism\u201d that has proven to be so successful thus far.

Does your mind stop? Does the world stop? Of course not. It may feel like time slows down for you, and surely this is true from a psychological perspective. But to suggest as you and others have that meditation provides some existence beyond time and space is, I think, to take a poetic description of certain meditative experiences as literal reality. Of course time doesn\u2019t stop when you meditate. The world has kept on trucking along while you\u2019re meditating.

Does your mind stop? Does the world stop? Of course not. It may feel like time slows down for you, and surely this is true from a psychological perspective. But to suggest as you and others have that meditation provides some existence beyond time and space is, I think, to take a poetic description of certain meditative experiences as literal reality. Of course time doesn\u2019t stop when you meditate. The world has kept on trucking along while you\u2019re meditating.

You write that that modern physics has a very good understanding of time. This is not at all true. I recommend that you read Carroll\u2019s From Eternity to Here to get a good feel for the very many problems that the conventional understanding of time leads to, and the many remaining conundrums in the physics and metaphysics of time.

Or, probably the best one: Prigogine\u2019s The End of Certainty. His entire career in nonequilibrium thermodynamics (for which he won a Nobel Prize) was aimed at showing the conventional views on the nature of time are off-base. Here\u2019s another piece of mine discussing these issues:http://www.independent.com/news/2011/dec/31/time-and-free-will/. My view is that the heart of the problems around our conceptions of time is the view that time is illusory, which itself stems from the block universe of relativity theory. More generally, one of the biggest problems modern physics faces is how to reconcile quantum mechanics and general relativity, which lead to very different conclusions about the nature of reality. It is not the case that our notions of time only break down at the singularity level. Problems with the conventional view of time are pervasive. Last, studying the nature of consciousness is leading to a reassessment of our view on the nature of time bc we realize now that the nature of time and the nature of mind are inextricably linked.Replyf1bert86says:10 years agoI\u2019m sorry but I think you have a very poor understanding of some well understood physics, statements like \u201cstudying the nature of consciousness is leading to a reassessment of our view on the nature of time bc we realize now that the nature of time and the nature of mind are inextricably linked.\u201d are just just complete baloney. The human mind has absolutely no bearing on the nature of time, you are confusing the fundamental laws of physics with the human experience and philosophical conceptions of time. I briefly read your link and I think this is your problem, you are extrapolating to gradiose ideas and conclusions based on a very elementary understanding of the physics.ReplyTam Huntsays:10 years agoAnother book suggestion for you: Christof Koch\u2019s Confessions of a Romantic Reductionist. He is a very well-respected biophysicist, full professor for 25 years at CalTech, before leaving for the Allen Institute for the Study of the Brain a couple of years. He wrote the foreword for my book of essays exploring the ramifications of panpsychism and a process view of time. He has come out publicly as supporting panpsychism and Tononi\u2019s Integrated Information Theory, a variety of panpsychism (even though Tononi doesn\u2019t like to use that term). Panpsychism and process philosophy are all about process and the passage of time. Do a bit more reading and thinking on these issues and you will probably come to see my points a bit more clearly even if you don\u2019t agree with them. Once you start looking into the scientific study of mind and time your views will probably change a bit.ReplyBDBincsays:10 years ago*There is only a theory of mind in science& it has been discredited.(Empty your cup so you can fill it Tam:)How does your mind define time?Can you find time existing outside of the mind?ReplyTam Huntsays:10 years agoBDB, I\u2019ve done a fair amount of meditation as well as psychedelic traveling, so I\u2019m pretty familiar with the concepts you\u2019re suggesting. After about 25 years of thinking on these issues I\u2019ve come to the view that there is nothing outside of time. Time is the container that defines existence. So, again, we can speak poetically of things outside space and time but we shouldn\u2019t take such descriptions literally. Mind is through and through about time. What is mind if not a process of awareness and experience? Process/change is all I mean by time. Now, words become tricky tools when we delve a bit deeper. When we go deeper into the ocean of being we realize that almost all change enfolds into Oneness, the Source, pure Spirit. But even here pure Spirit exists in time b/c how could it be the source of all things if it did not? Even Spirit changes over time. There is nothing beyond change, beyond time. This is the Buddha\u2019s teaching that actually has been lost and adulterated by those who forgot his key message: stop grasping at permanence. There is no permanence. All things change. Even Rigpa, Source, Spirit, Brahman. f1bert, continuing here since we\u2019ve run out of allowed replies. You write that that modern physics has a very good understanding of time.

My view is that the heart of the problems around our conceptions of time is the view that time is illusory, which itself stems from the block universe of relativity theory. More generally, one of the biggest problems modern physics faces is how to reconcile quantum mechanics and general relativity, which lead to very different conclusions about the nature of reality. It is not the case that our notions of time only break down at the singularity level. Problems with the conventional view of time are pervasive. Last, studying the nature of consciousness is leading to a reassessment of our view on the nature of time bc we realize now that the nature of time and the nature of mind are inextricably linked. f1bert86says:10 years agoI\u2019m sorry but I think you have a very poor understanding of some well understood physics, statements like \u201cstudying the nature of consciousness is leading to a reassessment of our view on the nature of time bc we realize now that the nature of time and the nature of mind are inextricably linked.\u201d are just just complete baloney. The human mind has absolutely no bearing on the nature of time, you are confusing the fundamental laws of physics with the human experience and philosophical conceptions of time.

He wrote the foreword for my book of essays exploring the ramifications of panpsychism and a process view of time. He has come out publicly as supporting panpsychism and Tononi\u2019s Integrated Information Theory, a variety of panpsychism (even though Tononi doesn\u2019t like to use that term).

This is not at all true. I recommend that you read Carroll\u2019s From Eternity to Here to get a good feel for the very many problems that the conventional understanding of time leads to, and the many remaining conundrums in the physics and metaphysics of time. Or Maudlin\u2019s The Metaphysics Within Physics. Or Lee Smolin\u2019s Time Reborn, or Smolin and Unger\u2019s The Singular Universe, or Price\u2019s Time\u2019s Arrow and Archimedes\u2019 Point. Or, probably the best one: Prigogine\u2019s The End of Certainty.

Do a bit more reading and thinking on these issues and you will probably come to see my points a bit more clearly even if you don\u2019t agree with them. Once you start looking into the scientific study of mind and time your views will probably change a bit. BDBincsays:10 years ago*There is only a theory of mind in science& it has been discredited.(Empty your cup so you can fill it Tam:)How does your mind define time?Can you find time existing outside of the mind?ReplyTam Huntsays:10 years agoBDB, I\u2019ve done a fair amount of meditation as well as psychedelic traveling, so I\u2019m pretty familiar with the concepts you\u2019re suggesting. After about 25 years of thinking on these issues I\u2019ve come to the view that there is nothing outside of time. Time is the container that defines existence. So, again, we can speak poetically of things outside space and time but we shouldn\u2019t take such descriptions literally. Mind is through and through about time. What is mind if not a process of awareness and experience? Process/change is all I mean by time. Now, words become tricky tools when we delve a bit deeper. When we go deeper into the ocean of being we realize that almost all change enfolds into Oneness, the Source, pure Spirit. But even here pure Spirit exists in time b/c how could it be the source of all things if it did not? Even Spirit changes over time. There is nothing beyond change, beyond time. This is the Buddha\u2019s teaching that actually has been lost and adulterated by those who forgot his key message: stop grasping at permanence. There is no permanence. All things change. Even Rigpa, Source, Spirit, Brahman. *There is only a theory of mind in science& it has been discredited.(Empty your cup so you can fill it Tam:)How does your mind define time?Can you find time existing outside of the mind?

Just more money being moved from the bottom to the rich corps.Because you are completely ignorant (and self confessed as confused) on this issue of \u201cClimate change\u201d and its carbon tax hedge funds -the corporations have no cut one flight they have increased them they are not proposing a ban on flights, cars or boats no repair of any the damage they have done to the environment nor do they wish to build communities but rather destroy them when the people cannot afford the new corporate costs added to food and services imposed with a carbon tax.Did you not know that your govt is a corporation?http://omnithought.org/why-right-vote-united-states-fraud/1875You have not recognized that there is no environmental solutions proposed by these corporations( they have been geoengineering secretly for many years).

You do not know how the privately owned fed reserve will be the ones that profit off the carbon tax they proposed. Seriously you don\u2019t even know about carbon trading and how the corporations can profit off it! The big corporations self regulate \u2013 have you not even heard about the TPPA?Mankind was suppose to live in harmony with nature. But the desired and proposed outcome of the \u201cclimate change\u201d political agenda is carbon taxing ( hit the poor the hardest with food and services )and a carbon trading business for wall street, this will increase the global inequality and imbalance.You will note that the corporation (your govt -environmental party) has not educated the people or told/ made the corporations clean up their pollution .There is legislation now to do that but they don\u2019t they just talk about how they will get more followers= political power.The campaign targets Ignorant people who say they care about the planet earth and don\u2019t know how to read or question the false data released by corporate media on climate are easily sucked in believing.Lucky there is a group of scientists refuting learned ignorance and unscientific Al Gore political propaganda.Only corporate shills, corporate owned media and the ignorant fools that believed it keep trying to breathe life into the political Al Gore lie.PJsays:10 years agoObviously I didn\u2019t write well enough to Express my opinion and what I actually mean. I am not English-speaking originally, so I apologize for that.We are really writing through each other. We have the same belief about the rigged system, only we write in different ways. And again I apologize for any misunderstanding.As for the site you refer to I have looked into it. As I said, I am an open minded person, and don\u2019t draw any conclusions. I test and observe what happens. That\u2019s what I did to you. I challenged you and you responded. Great. I just want to learn more to get a better perspective on what is happening to us. Confusion and open-minded-ness are not one and the same.Where you are wrong, is in your accusations and assumptions that I just puke up anything I\u2019ve heard on the News, which is quite an ignorant statement as I don\u2019t watch the News. This is called the inferiority complex; where you view yourself as superior just because you know some shit I don\u2019t. Work on that. It won\u2019t do you any good in the long run, as you will lose credibility.I HAVE looked into all things you mentioned. And I know climate change-talk is just distraction from the actual action-taking that needs to happen. And the system/politicians won\u2019t do jack-shit about it. Unless we change it. But the site you refer to claims it is fake, but at the same time say it is real. Only they say it is a symptom and not the cause. Exactly the same as I meant. It is a symptom of the ecological disaster happening right now.Another point where you \u201cassume\u201d things is when I said the environmental party was gaining momentum. They are not in Power. The Political Right is. But they will lose the next election as they neglect the ecological disaster we are facing. They don\u2019t believe an ecological disaster is happening or think the economy is more impotant. They just lowered taxes by 50% on the Rich, and lower it by 50$ for the poor and middleclass. In my country there is currently 8 different parties in the House. We don\u2019t have a two-party-illusion-of-choice-system as you have in the DSA.The environmental party as of now have 1 representative, but looks to have 7-14 the next election. They actually try to make the corporations be held accountable for their actions and has proposed to the other parties to end oil dependency and oil-drilling immediately.

Maybe the system in America is unchangeable, but that\u2019s not the case here.Before you misunderstand me as a fool and try to debunk everything I wrote, consider the fact that some things might have been lost in translation. \ud83d\ude09P.S.

I think you\u2019re drawing the wrong conclusions. The corporations want you to buy stuff and increase your carbon footprint as that is the only way they can make money. How can they profit off of a self-reliant community. Go to war and try to submit them to their will? Maybe.Have you ever been to Beijing for example? The pollution is real, as is man-made climate change. If you don\u2019t think so, you\u2019re the ignorant really.

But don\u2019t mistake climate change for a corporate agenda, as the world is in an ecological disaster because of western lifestyle.

On the subject of consumption I never mentioned FOOD consumption (I thought that was obvious). And on the subject of services. What services do a self-reliant person need\u2026 There is no such event happening as Al Gore\u2019s fictional \u201cman made global warming\u201d if you remember which was promoted by (pseudo)science then when it was destroyed as bunk it was renamed to \u201cclimate change\u201d campaign. It has nothing to do with reduced consumption, its about the corporation imposing a carbon tax on people for food and services and creating carbon trading for wall st which would creating a new profitable industry for the banksters. It is about transferring more of the energy of the poor and middle class which will be hit first and hardest with their money going to the elitist pig\u2019s banking cartel (EPBC)= or as some prefer to call them the NWO.Supporting the \u201d man made global warming\u201d cum \u201cClimate change\u201d propaganda when it would ratchet up the cost of basic goods and services -harming the poor first and moving the middle class into poverty is harmful to humanity with no change to the climate or environment. Just more money being moved from the bottom to the rich corps. Because you are completely ignorant (and self confessed as confused) on this issue of \u201cClimate change\u201d and its carbon tax hedge funds -the corporations have no cut one flight they have increased them they are not proposing a ban on flights, cars or boats no repair of any the damage they have done to the environment nor do they wish to build communities but rather destroy them when the people cannot afford the new corporate costs added to food and services imposed with a carbon tax. Did you not know that your govt is a corporation?http://omnithought.org/why-right-vote-united-states-fraud/1875 You have not recognized that there is no environmental solutions proposed by these corporations( they have been geoengineering secretly for many years).

On the subject of consumption I never mentioned FOOD consumption (I thought that was obvious). And on the subject of services. What services do a self-reliant person need\u2026 Obviously I didn\u2019t write well enough to Express my opinion and what I actually mean. I am not English-speaking originally, so I apologize for that. We are really writing through each other. We have the same belief about the rigged system, only we write in different ways. And again I apologize for any misunderstanding. As for the site you refer to I have looked into it. As I said, I am an open minded person, and don\u2019t draw any conclusions. I test and observe what happens. That\u2019s what I did to you. I challenged you and you responded. Great. I just want to learn more to get a better perspective on what is happening to us. Confusion and open-minded-ness are not one and the same. Where you are wrong, is in your accusations and assumptions that I just puke up anything I\u2019ve heard on the News, which is quite an ignorant statement as I don\u2019t watch the News. This is called the inferiority complex; where you view yourself as superior just because you know some shit I don\u2019t. Work on that. It won\u2019t do you any good in the long run, as you will lose credibility. I HAVE looked into all things you mentioned. And I know climate change-talk is just distraction from the actual action-taking that needs to happen. And the system/politicians won\u2019t do jack-shit about it. Unless we change it. But the site you refer to claims it is fake, but at the same time say it is real. Only they say it is a symptom and not the cause. Exactly the same as I meant. It is a symptom of the ecological disaster happening right now. Another point where you \u201cassume\u201d things is when I said the environmental party was gaining momentum. They are not in Power. The Political Right is. But they will lose the next election as they neglect the ecological disaster we are facing. They don\u2019t believe an ecological disaster is happening or think the economy is more impotant. They just lowered taxes by 50% on the Rich, and lower it by 50$ for the poor and middleclass. In my country there is currently 8 different parties in the House. We don\u2019t have a two-party-illusion-of-choice-system as you have in the DSA.The environmental party as of now have 1 representative, but looks to have 7-14 the next election. They actually try to make the corporations be held accountable for their actions and has proposed to the other parties to end oil dependency and oil-drilling immediately. I won\u2019t elaborate on this as it is a digression of the matter at hand. You mistake me for a fool. What I try to do is educate People on the lie they are living. That the chasing of Money and the accumulation of possession to supposedly find happiness is a fraud to keep them in the system/Matrix or whatever you would like to Call it.

On the subject of consumption I never mentioned FOOD consumption (I thought that was obvious). And on the subject of services. What services do a self-reliant person need\u2026 Oh and since I have your consent.. a few more disagreements with your other ideas in your article . Today\u2019s \u201cscience industry\u201d is corrupt it is no more than a pseudo science. Modern Pscience has not even been able to agree on the definition of consciousness . Its become a who\u2019s who with media name dropping org work for as credibility to the public. Theory ? No. Now days in this consensus industry cult members believe unproven theories to be more than theories( facts) especially if the idea is from a (media made ) famous name . Scientists that do not agree with politically driven ideas and propaganda are quickly discredited by the media or their once peers that want to stay in the money. The worry is not that they don\u2019t know that they are not objective but most have lost the power of the reasoning mind and desire fame( publishing) and fortune( funding). On a positive note we agree it is time for a change\u2026 but until ALL the factors that have ruined science(corporate ego mind set) are removed \u2026 it is not enough to tell them they are not objective.Protecting the ego to them is more important than truth/knowledge/science. They misidentify themselves as their ideas and they fight to protect the ideas as though they will die/loose themselves. The belief system of the cult of pscience is used to spread corporate propaganda such as \u201cMan made global warming\u201d for the set up of carbon taxes & \u201cCarbon trading\u201d \u201d toxic fluoride in your water\u201d \u2026all manner of control systems. I think you have underestimated the state of pscience (misdiagnosed it as just having the objective sniffles). Time is an illusion.Without the mind where is time. Peter Johnsensays:10 years agoI completely agree with you on the fact that science is often clouded by the scientists bias (ego-mindset). And that to many conflict \u201ctheir\u201d ideas as a part of their Identity. You don\u2019t have to stand idle by your ideas and opinions, I often say, that\u2019s the whole idea of being open-minded \u2013 to draw no conclusions, except, of course, you need principles (based on your present knowledge) to guide you through life or else you will stay in complete paralysis.Where I lost you is where you state that man-made global warming is corporate propaganda. Which Corporations benefit from reduced consumption? Which Corporations benefit from a society using their bodies as they were designed to get around instead of driving cars, planes, and boats?Maybe I got confused somewhere, but isn\u2019t the whole environmentalist-idea that we all live to build better communities instead of more profit for Corporations\u2026ReplyBDBincsays:10 years agoThere is no such event happening as Al Gore\u2019s fictional \u201cman made global warming\u201d if you remember which was promoted by (pseudo)science then when it was destroyed as bunk it was renamed to \u201cclimate change\u201d campaign.It has nothing to do with reduced consumption, its about the corporation imposing a carbon tax on people for food and services and creating carbon trading for wall st which would creating a new profitable industry for the banksters. It is about transferring more of the energy of the poor and middle class which will be hit first and hardest with their money going to the elitist pig\u2019s banking cartel (EPBC)= or as some prefer to call them the NWO.Supporting the \u201d man made global warming\u201d cum \u201cClimate change\u201d propaganda when it would ratchet up the cost of basic goods and services -harming the poor first and moving the middle class into poverty is harmful to humanity with no change to the climate or environment. Just more money being moved from the bottom to the rich corps.Because you are completely ignorant (and self confessed as confused) on this issue of \u201cClimate change\u201d and its carbon tax hedge funds -the corporations have no cut one flight they have increased them they are not proposing a ban on flights, cars or boats no repair of any the damage they have done to the environment nor do they wish to build communities but rather destroy them when the people cannot afford the new corporate costs added to food and services imposed with a carbon tax.Did you not know that your govt is a corporation?http://omnithought.org/why-right-vote-united-states-fraud/1875You have not recognized that there is no environmental solutions proposed by these corporations( they have been geoengineering secretly for many years). Its a front.*I thought I was permitted the last word \ud83d\ude42ReplyPeter Johnsensays:10 years agoAnd I thought I was a Conspiracy Theorist.Word of advice: keep your personal attacks to someone who actually deserves it. I am not ignorant as I am open to all possible realities. I haven\u2019t taken an absolute standpoint in anything. There are no absolutes. Everybody has an agenda, whether for good or bad. Someone will be offended by your agenda anyway you put it.Well, this sure was an interesting read, but clearly you are mistaking U.S.A. with the rest of the world. Although I do believe some of the politicians in my country have a hidden agenda, the Environmental Party is gaining momentum and looks to add their tally in the Parliament by 10-15 times the next election. A party that is quite open about reducing consumption and taking a few steps back in our material wealth, but spiritually declined society.The reason the World is msessed up is because People have been led to believe that they need all this material stuff the Corporations push on them. But then again being fooled over and over again is not the Corporations fault, it is Yours. Do you drive a car? You\u2019re a fool. Do you travel by airplane? You\u2019re a fool. Do you buy Coca-Cola? You\u2019re a fool. The People Power is real whether you believe in it or not. People need to be educated on what is actually good for them, and need to be taught how to be self-reliant and produce their own Food and make their own materials and Tools to survive. The biggest threat to society is, and have always been capitalism, as it Divides People and conquers land to consume more stuff. And who is in charge of this? The People buying in to the corporates shit. Self-reliancy and Anarchy are the only concepts that will make People free again. The uniting of nations was a fraud to divide and conquer People. But don\u2019t blame the Conqueror for conquering.Don\u2019t blame the wolf for eating sheep, it\u2019s in his nature. Blame ignorance. Ignorance is real. But I am not ignorant to the truth, as I take constant action to reduce my reliancy on corporations of thieves and liers.As for climate change, how can 97% of science on climate change be a fraud? .If you really think everybody is bought off and paid for clearly you have a very suspicious mind. I think you\u2019re drawing the wrong conclusions. The corporations want you to buy stuff and increase your carbon footprint as that is the only way they can make money. How can they profit off of a self-reliant community. Go to war and try to submit them to their will? Maybe.Have you ever been to Beijing for example? The pollution is real, as is man-made climate change. If you don\u2019t think so, you\u2019re the ignorant really. Have you ever seen the disaster of tar sand Projects in Canada?Let me try to explains this to you using Your body as an example. If you pull your lungs out of your body, will you still be able to Breathe? If you clog up your arteries, what happens next?Mankind was made to live in harmony with nature, not trying to submit it to their will. If you really want to change the world. Speak up about it. But don\u2019t mistake climate change for a corporate agenda, as the world is in an ecological disaster because of western lifestyle. There is no Money to be made out of People living in harmony with nature. Educate the masses and make them understand what their lifestyle choices is doing to the world.ReplyBDBincsays:10 years agoYour speech/words on what you do not understand makes it clear you are ignorant and as confused as you said you were.Pollution is real but \u201cman made global warming/climate change\u201d by Co2 emissions is not true.There is much poverty in the world and the last thing the poor need right now is more austerity, a decrease in their material wealth, transfer of wealth to the corporations for carbon trading, or decrease in their consumption of food and needed services this was an ignorant cruel thing to propose.

It is about transferring more of the energy of the poor and middle class which will be hit first and hardest with their money going to the elitist pig\u2019s banking cartel (EPBC)= or as some prefer to call them the NWO.Supporting the \u201d man made global warming\u201d cum \u201cClimate change\u201d propaganda when it would ratchet up the cost of basic goods and services -harming the poor first and moving the middle class into poverty is harmful to humanity with no change to the climate or environment. Just more money being moved from the bottom to the rich corps. Because you are completely ignorant (and self confessed as confused) on this issue of \u201cClimate change\u201d and its carbon tax hedge funds -the corporations have no cut one flight they have increased them they are not proposing a ban on flights, cars or boats no repair of any the damage they have done to the environment nor do they wish to build communities but rather destroy them when the people cannot afford the new corporate costs added to food and services imposed with a carbon tax. Did you not know that your govt is a corporation?http://omnithought.org/why-right-vote-united-states-fraud/1875 You have not recognized that there is no environmental solutions proposed by these corporations( they have been geoengineering secretly for many years). Its a front. *I thought I was permitted the last word \ud83d\ude42 Peter Johnsensays:10 years agoAnd I thought I was a Conspiracy Theorist.Word of advice: keep your personal attacks to someone who actually deserves it.

A party that is quite open about reducing consumption and taking a few steps back in our material wealth, but spiritually declined society.The reason the World is msessed up is because People have been led to believe that they need all this material stuff the Corporations push on them.

Do you buy Coca-Cola? You\u2019re a fool. The People Power is real whether you believe in it or not. People need to be educated on what is actually good for them, and need to be taught how to be self-reliant and produce their own Food and make their own materials and Tools to survive. The biggest threat to society is, and have always been capitalism, as it Divides People and conquers land to consume more stuff. And who is in charge of this? The People buying in to the corporates shit. Self-reliancy and Anarchy are the only concepts that will make People free again. The uniting of nations was a fraud to divide and conquer People.

But I am not ignorant to the truth, as I take constant action to reduce my reliancy on corporations of thieves and liers.As for climate change, how can 97% of science on climate change be a fraud? .If you really think everybody is bought off and paid for clearly you have a very suspicious mind. I think you\u2019re drawing the wrong conclusions. The corporations want you to buy stuff and increase your carbon footprint as that is the only way they can make money. How can they profit off of a self-reliant community. Go to war and try to submit them to their will? Maybe.Have you ever been to Beijing for example? The pollution is real, as is man-made climate change. If you don\u2019t think so, you\u2019re the ignorant really. Have you ever seen the disaster of tar sand Projects in Canada?Let me try to explains this to you using Your body as an example. If you pull your lungs out of your body, will you still be able to Breathe? If you clog up your arteries, what happens next?Mankind was made to live in harmony with nature, not trying to submit it to their will. If you really want to change the world. Speak up about it. But don\u2019t mistake climate change for a corporate agenda, as the world is in an ecological disaster because of western lifestyle.

The Political Right is. But they will lose the next election as they neglect the ecological disaster we are facing.

That the chasing of Money and the accumulation of possession to supposedly find happiness is a fraud to keep them in the system/Matrix or whatever you would like to Call it. I promote self-reliancy, and Learning the happiness-habit, and building a strong mind and body, through nutrition, sleep, mental and physical training to be better able to withstand stress and be happy where they are, and instead of chasing Money, a career and fame build a strong and sustainable open, inclusive and all-loving local community.The first thing we must do to hold the Corporations accountable, is to educate the masses on what is happening, so they can make informed Choices instead of relying on the system and the same old corrupt political parties that has been in Power since forever.I believe a strong empowered People is the only thing that can change anything, and to that we both agree, or am I mistaken?

On the subject of consumption I never mentioned FOOD consumption (I thought that was obvious). And on the subject of services.

You don\u2019t have to stand idle by your ideas and opinions, I often say, that\u2019s the whole idea of being open-minded \u2013 to draw no conclusions, except, of course, you need principles (based on your present knowledge) to guide you through life or else you will stay in complete paralysis. Where I lost you is where you state that man-made global warming is corporate propaganda. Which Corporations benefit from reduced consumption? Which Corporations benefit from a society using their bodies as they were designed to get around instead of driving cars, planes, and boats? Maybe I got confused somewhere, but isn\u2019t the whole environmentalist-idea that we all live to build better communities instead of more profit for Corporations\u2026 BDBincsays:10 years agoThere is no such event happening as Al Gore\u2019s fictional \u201cman made global warming\u201d if you remember which was promoted by (pseudo)science then when it was destroyed as bunk it was renamed to \u201cclimate change\u201d campaign.It has nothing to do with reduced consumption, its about the corporation imposing a carbon tax on people for food and services and creating carbon trading for wall st which would creating a new profitable industry for the banksters.

On the subject of consumption I never mentioned FOOD consumption (I thought that was obvious). And on the subject of services. What services do a self-reliant person need\u2026 There is no such event happening as Al Gore\u2019s fictional \u201cman made global warming\u201d if you remember which was promoted by (pseudo)science then when it was destroyed as bunk it was renamed to \u201cclimate change\u201d campaign. It has nothing to do with reduced consumption, its about the corporation imposing a carbon tax on people for food and services and creating carbon trading for wall st which would creating a new profitable industry for the banksters. It is about transferring more of the energy of the poor and middle class which will be hit first and hardest with their money going to the elitist pig\u2019s banking cartel (EPBC)= or as some prefer to call them the NWO.Supporting the \u201d man made global warming\u201d cum \u201cClimate change\u201d propaganda when it would ratchet up the cost of basic goods and services -harming the poor first and moving the middle class into poverty is harmful to humanity with no change to the climate or environment. Just more money being moved from the bottom to the rich corps. Because you are completely ignorant (and self confessed as confused) on this issue of \u201cClimate change\u201d and its carbon tax hedge funds -the corporations have no cut one flight they have increased them they are not proposing a ban on flights, cars or boats no repair of any the damage they have done to the environment nor do they wish to build communities but rather destroy them when the people cannot afford the new corporate costs added to food and services imposed with a carbon tax. Did you not know that your govt is a corporation?http://omnithought.org/why-right-vote-united-states-fraud/1875 You have not recognized that there is no environmental solutions proposed by these corporations( they have been geoengineering secretly for many years). Its a front. *I thought I was permitted the last word \ud83d\ude42 Peter Johnsensays:10 years agoAnd I thought I was a Conspiracy Theorist.Word of advice: keep your personal attacks to someone who actually deserves it.

Although I do believe some of the politicians in my country have a hidden agenda, the Environmental Party is gaining momentum and looks to add their tally in the Parliament by 10-15 times the next election. A party that is quite open about reducing consumption and taking a few steps back in our material wealth, but spiritually declined society.The reason the World is msessed up is because People have been led to believe that they need all this material stuff the Corporations push on them. But then again being fooled over and over again is not the Corporations fault, it is Yours. Do you drive a car? You\u2019re a fool. Do you travel by airplane? You\u2019re a fool.

And again I apologize for any misunderstanding. As for the site you refer to I have looked into it. As I said, I am an open minded person, and don\u2019t draw any conclusions. I test and observe what happens. That\u2019s what I did to you. I challenged you and you responded. Great. I just want to learn more to get a better perspective on what is happening to us. Confusion and open-minded-ness are not one and the same. Where you are wrong, is in your accusations and assumptions that I just puke up anything I\u2019ve heard on the News, which is quite an ignorant statement as I don\u2019t watch the News. This is called the inferiority complex; where you view yourself as superior just because you know some shit I don\u2019t. Work on that. It won\u2019t do you any good in the long run, as you will lose credibility. I HAVE looked into all things you mentioned. And I know climate change-talk is just distraction from the actual action-taking that needs to happen. And the system/politicians won\u2019t do jack-shit about it. Unless we change it. But the site you refer to claims it is fake, but at the same time say it is real. Only they say it is a symptom and not the cause. Exactly the same as I meant. It is a symptom of the ecological disaster happening right now. Another point where you \u201cassume\u201d things is when I said the environmental party was gaining momentum. They are not in Power. The Political Right is. But they will lose the next election as they neglect the ecological disaster we are facing. They don\u2019t believe an ecological disaster is happening or think the economy is more impotant. They just lowered taxes by 50% on the Rich, and lower it by 50$ for the poor and middleclass. In my country there is currently 8 different parties in the House. We don\u2019t have a two-party-illusion-of-choice-system as you have in the DSA.The environmental party as of now have 1 representative, but looks to have 7-14 the next election. They actually try to make the corporations be held accountable for their actions and has proposed to the other parties to end oil dependency and oil-drilling immediately. I won\u2019t elaborate on this as it is a digression of the matter at hand. You mistake me for a fool. What I try to do is educate People on the lie they are living. That the chasing of Money and the accumulation of possession to supposedly find happiness is a fraud to keep them in the system/Matrix or whatever you would like to Call it. I promote self-reliancy, and Learning the happiness-habit, and building a strong mind and body, through nutrition, sleep, mental and physical training to be better able to withstand stress and be happy where they are, and instead of chasing Money, a career and fame build a strong and sustainable open, inclusive and all-loving local community.The first thing we must do to hold the Corporations accountable, is to educate the masses on what is happening, so they can make informed Choices instead of relying on the system and the same old corrupt political parties that has been in Power since forever. I believe a strong empowered People is the only thing that can change anything, and to that we both agree, or am I mistaken? Maybe the system in America is unchangeable, but that\u2019s not the case here. Before you misunderstand me as a fool and try to debunk everything I wrote, consider the fact that some things might have been lost in translation. \ud83d\ude09 P.S. On the subject of consumption I never mentioned FOOD consumption (I thought that was obvious). And on the subject of services. What services do a self-reliant person need\u2026 There is no such event happening as Al Gore\u2019s fictional \u201cman made global warming\u201d if you remember which was promoted by (pseudo)science then when it was destroyed as bunk it was renamed to \u201cclimate change\u201d campaign. It has nothing to do with reduced consumption, its about the corporation imposing a carbon tax on people for food and services and creating carbon trading for wall st which would creating a new profitable industry for the banksters. It is about transferring more of the energy of the poor and middle class which will be hit first and hardest with their money going to the elitist pig\u2019s banking cartel (EPBC)= or as some prefer to call them the NWO.Supporting the \u201d man made global warming\u201d cum \u201cClimate change\u201d propaganda when it would ratchet up the cost of basic goods and services -harming the poor first and moving the middle class into poverty is harmful to humanity with no change to the climate or environment. Just more money being moved from the bottom to the rich corps. Because you are completely ignorant (and self confessed as confused) on this issue of \u201cClimate change\u201d and its carbon tax hedge funds -the corporations have no cut one flight they have increased them they are not proposing a ban on flights, cars or boats no repair of any the damage they have done to the environment nor do they wish to build communities but rather destroy them when the people cannot afford the new corporate costs added to food and services imposed with a carbon tax. Did you not know that your govt is a corporation?http://omnithought.org/why-right-vote-united-states-fraud/1875 You have not recognized that there is no environmental solutions proposed by these corporations( they have been geoengineering secretly for many years). Its a front. *I thought I was permitted the last word \ud83d\ude42 Peter Johnsensays:10 years agoAnd I thought I was a Conspiracy Theorist.Word of advice: keep your personal attacks to someone who actually deserves it. I am not ignorant as I am open to all possible realities. I haven\u2019t taken an absolute standpoint in anything. There are no absolutes. Everybody has an agenda, whether for good or bad. Someone will be offended by your agenda anyway you put it.Well, this sure was an interesting read, but clearly you are mistaking U.S.A. with the rest of the world. Although I do believe some of the politicians in my country have a hidden agenda, the Environmental Party is gaining momentum and looks to add their tally in the Parliament by 10-15 times the next election. A party that is quite open about reducing consumption and taking a few steps back in our material wealth, but spiritually declined society.The reason the World is msessed up is because People have been led to believe that they need all this material stuff the Corporations push on them. But then again being fooled over and over again is not the Corporations fault, it is Yours. Do you drive a car? You\u2019re a fool. Do you travel by airplane? You\u2019re a fool. Do you buy Coca-Cola? You\u2019re a fool. The People Power is real whether you believe in it or not. People need to be educated on what is actually good for them, and need to be taught how to be self-reliant and produce their own Food and make their own materials and Tools to survive. The biggest threat to society is, and have always been capitalism, as it Divides People and conquers land to consume more stuff. And who is in charge of this? The People buying in to the corporates shit. Self-reliancy and Anarchy are the only concepts that will make People free again. The uniting of nations was a fraud to divide and conquer People. But don\u2019t blame the Conqueror for conquering.Don\u2019t blame the wolf for eating sheep, it\u2019s in his nature. Blame ignorance. Ignorance is real. But I am not ignorant to the truth, as I take constant action to reduce my reliancy on corporations of thieves and liers.As for climate change, how can 97% of science on climate change be a fraud? .If you really think everybody is bought off and paid for clearly you have a very suspicious mind. I think you\u2019re drawing the wrong conclusions. The corporations want you to buy stuff and increase your carbon footprint as that is the only way they can make money. How can they profit off of a self-reliant community. Go to war and try to submit them to their will? Maybe.Have you ever been to Beijing for example? The pollution is real, as is man-made climate change. If you don\u2019t think so, you\u2019re the ignorant really. Have you ever seen the disaster of tar sand Projects in Canada?Let me try to explains this to you using Your body as an example. If you pull your lungs out of your body, will you still be able to Breathe? If you clog up your arteries, what happens next?Mankind was made to live in harmony with nature, not trying to submit it to their will. If you really want to change the world. Speak up about it. But don\u2019t mistake climate change for a corporate agenda, as the world is in an ecological disaster because of western lifestyle. There is no Money to be made out of People living in harmony with nature. Educate the masses and make them understand what their lifestyle choices is doing to the world.ReplyBDBincsays:10 years agoYour speech/words on what you do not understand makes it clear you are ignorant and as confused as you said you were.Pollution is real but \u201cman made global warming/climate change\u201d by Co2 emissions is not true.There is much poverty in the world and the last thing the poor need right now is more austerity, a decrease in their material wealth, transfer of wealth to the corporations for carbon trading, or decrease in their consumption of food and needed services this was an ignorant cruel thing to propose.

But the desired and proposed outcome of the \u201cclimate change\u201d political agenda is carbon taxing ( hit the poor the hardest with food and services )and a carbon trading business for wall street, this will increase the global inequality and imbalance.You will note that the corporation (your govt -environmental party) has not educated the people or told/ made the corporations clean up their pollution .There is legislation now to do that but they don\u2019t they just talk about how they will get more followers= political power.The campaign targets Ignorant people who say they care about the planet earth and don\u2019t know how to read or question the false data released by corporate media on climate are easily sucked in believing.Lucky there is a group of scientists refuting learned ignorance and unscientific Al Gore political propaganda.Only corporate shills, corporate owned media and the ignorant fools that believed it keep trying to breathe life into the political Al Gore lie.PJsays:10 years agoObviously I didn\u2019t write well enough to Express my opinion and what I actually mean.

The reason the World is msessed up is because People have been led to believe that they need all this material stuff the Corporations push on them. But then again being fooled over and over again is not the Corporations fault, it is Yours. Do you drive a car? You\u2019re a fool. Do you travel by airplane? You\u2019re a fool. Do you buy Coca-Cola? You\u2019re a fool. The People Power is real whether you believe in it or not. People need to be educated on what is actually good for them, and need to be taught how to be self-reliant and produce their own Food and make their own materials and Tools to survive. The biggest threat to society is, and have always been capitalism, as it Divides People and conquers land to consume more stuff. And who is in charge of this? The People buying in to the corporates shit. Self-reliancy and Anarchy are the only concepts that will make People free again. The uniting of nations was a fraud to divide and conquer People. But don\u2019t blame the Conqueror for conquering.Don\u2019t blame the wolf for eating sheep, it\u2019s in his nature. Blame ignorance. Ignorance is real. But I am not ignorant to the truth, as I take constant action to reduce my reliancy on corporations of thieves and liers. As for climate change, how can 97% of science on climate change be a fraud? .If you really think everybody is bought off and paid for clearly you have a very suspicious mind. I think you\u2019re drawing the wrong conclusions. The corporations want you to buy stuff and increase your carbon footprint as that is the only way they can make money. How can they profit off of a self-reliant community. Go to war and try to submit them to their will? Maybe. Have you ever been to Beijing for example? The pollution is real, as is man-made climate change. If you don\u2019t think so, you\u2019re the ignorant really. Have you ever seen the disaster of tar sand Projects in Canada? Let me try to explains this to you using Your body as an example. If you pull your lungs out of your body, will you still be able to Breathe? If you clog up your arteries, what happens next? Mankind was made to live in harmony with nature, not trying to submit it to their will. If you really want to change the world. Speak up about it. But don\u2019t mistake climate change for a corporate agenda, as the world is in an ecological disaster because of western lifestyle. There is no Money to be made out of People living in harmony with nature. Educate the masses and make them understand what their lifestyle choices is doing to the world. BDBincsays:10 years agoYour speech/words on what you do not understand makes it clear you are ignorant and as confused as you said you were.Pollution is real but \u201cman made global warming/climate change\u201d by Co2 emissions is not true.There is much poverty in the world and the last thing the poor need right now is more austerity, a decrease in their material wealth, transfer of wealth to the corporations for carbon trading, or decrease in their consumption of food and needed services this was an ignorant cruel thing to propose.

And again I apologize for any misunderstanding.As for the site you refer to I have looked into it. As I said, I am an open minded person, and don\u2019t draw any conclusions. I test and observe what happens. That\u2019s what I did to you. I challenged you and you responded. Great. I just want to learn more to get a better perspective on what is happening to us. Confusion and open-minded-ness are not one and the same.Where you are wrong, is in your accusations and assumptions that I just puke up anything I\u2019ve heard on the News, which is quite an ignorant statement as I don\u2019t watch the News. This is called the inferiority complex; where you view yourself as superior just because you know some shit I don\u2019t. Work on that. It won\u2019t do you any good in the long run, as you will lose credibility.I HAVE looked into all things you mentioned. And I know climate change-talk is just distraction from the actual action-taking that needs to happen. And the system/politicians won\u2019t do jack-shit about it. Unless we change it. But the site you refer to claims it is fake, but at the same time say it is real. Only they say it is a symptom and not the cause. Exactly the same as I meant. It is a symptom of the ecological disaster happening right now.Another point where you \u201cassume\u201d things is when I said the environmental party was gaining momentum. They are not in Power. The Political Right is. But they will lose the next election as they neglect the ecological disaster we are facing. They don\u2019t believe an ecological disaster is happening or think the economy is more impotant. They just lowered taxes by 50% on the Rich, and lower it by 50$ for the poor and middleclass. In my country there is currently 8 different parties in the House. We don\u2019t have a two-party-illusion-of-choice-system as you have in the DSA.The environmental party as of now have 1 representative, but looks to have 7-14 the next election. They actually try to make the corporations be held accountable for their actions and has proposed to the other parties to end oil dependency and oil-drilling immediately. I won\u2019t elaborate on this as it is a digression of the matter at hand.You mistake me for a fool. What I try to do is educate People on the lie they are living. That the chasing of Money and the accumulation of possession to supposedly find happiness is a fraud to keep them in the system/Matrix or whatever you would like to Call it. I promote self-reliancy, and Learning the happiness-habit, and building a strong mind and body, through nutrition, sleep, mental and physical training to be better able to withstand stress and be happy where they are, and instead of chasing Money, a career and fame build a strong and sustainable open, inclusive and all-loving local community.The first thing we must do to hold the Corporations accountable, is to educate the masses on what is happening, so they can make informed Choices instead of relying on the system and the same old corrupt political parties that has been in Power since forever.I believe a strong empowered People is the only thing that can change anything, and to that we both agree, or am I mistaken?

The cosmos was \u201cintended\u201d and therefore a wave collapse cascade started. This continuing cascade is the cosmological \u201carrow of time\u201d as witnessed. Time has a direction because the cascade has a beginning point. Sentient life was \u201cintended\u201d and was intended to have \u201cintentions\u201d within the universe device and so here we are, experiencing within our own wave collapse cascade the cosmological cascade, which is why we experience both subjective and objective \u201ctime\u201d. Time for sentient beings is a \u201clocation\u201d which moves forward from our individual wave collapse starting at the moment the universe device was instructed of the intention of our personal life by the DNA code at conception.
