You know those geniuses who Jay Leno used to interview on the street who couldn\u2019t answer basic questions like who the vice president is, or what Columbus Day celebrates? Well, what if someone like that ran for Congress and actually won? How funny would that be! Producer: Great! We\u2019ll get Amy Schumer or Lena Dunham to play the lead! Executive: No, I said it\u2019s supposed to be funny. Yes, you\u2019ve seen some version of this before. It was basically \u201cThe Distinguished Gentleman,\u201d and \u201cLegally Blonde 2,\u201d and now it\u2019s been rebooted for the millennial generation in the form of \u201cMs. Ocasio-Cortez Goes to Washington (If She Can Find It).\u201d But this version is less funny than the originals (which says a lot) because it\u2019s actually happening. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is a twenty-eight-year old community organizer\u2026 or something (actually, it\u2019s unclear even from her own website what exactly she does for a living, thoughshe was a bartender less than a year ago)\u2026 and of the almost 700,000 people in New York\u2019s 14thcongressional district, about 15,000 of them decided for everyone else that she is the most qualified person to represent them in Congress. And though that was just a primary election, there is no doubt she will win November\u2019s general election, because she\u2019s a Democrat and 110% of the voters in her district are also Democrats. (I added the extra 10% to account for fraudulent voters and dead people, though that\u2019s probably a conservative estimate). All that remains is her coronation. That has already begun, as she tours the country with her mentor, money maven Bernie Sanders, much to the delight of Republicans, who could not be happier with her sudden ascendancy to the apex of the Democratic Party. It is not hard to see why. She has already proven herself to be totally clueless on major issues. For example, when asked to explain why unemployment is low, she complained \u201cbecause everyone has two jobs. Unemployment is low because people are working 60, 70, 80 hours a week and can barely feed their family.\u201d Forget for a moment that she is lamenting that unemployment is low, and forget also that she is just wrong on the facts: many have already pointed out thatAmericans working multiple jobs are outnumbered by Americans working one job by about 148 million to 7 million,and, no, Americans are not working more than they have in the past. Fine. What is more worrisome is her inability to draw a logical connection between the question and her answer. Even if all workers did have two jobs, that could never explain low unemployment, because if anything, that would decrease the amount of jobs available to everyone else, and thereby raise, not lower, unemployment. It\u2019s one thing to be wrong on the facts, but it\u2019s quite something else to still be wrong even if your facts are assumed right. This just demonstrates defective thinking. The liberals over at Slate.comreferred to her statement as a \u201cgaffe,\u201dbut no, a \u201cgaffe\u201d is when you misspeak \u2014like when she said Democrats are going to \u201cflip a Republican seat red\u201d\u2014 not when you are totally uninformed and can\u2019t logically process a thought. Her economic illiteracy does not stop there. She demands that all student loans be forgiven, saying that \u201c[f]or the cost of the GOP\u2019s tax bill, we could forgive ALL the student loan debt in the United States,\u201d But pointing to the \u201ccost\u201d of a tax cut, as though it is a government appropriation, demonstrates her incognizance of the economic benefits \u2014 such as job creation \u2013 that come with people keeping more money of their own to invest. She also claims \u201ccapitalism has not always existed in the world, and it will not always exist in the world.\u201d Actually, it pretty much has always existed as long as people have exchanged things: goods for goods, services for services, services for goods. Any sort of productive economic activity is necessarily capitalist. And what do you mean it won\u2019t always exist? Well, let us not jump to ridiculous conclusions. She is obviously not proposing a post-economic world where we return to subsistence farming, hunting and gathering, and forced labor (though socialism has a strong track record of producing exactly that). She just does not know what capitalism is or what she\u2019s talking about. Okay, so economics is not her strength. Actually, it is! One of her two majors atBoston University was economics, and she allegedly graduated fourth in her class. But she\u2019s a millennial, so it\u2019s not surprising that she received good grades and a diploma for apparently learning nothing, other than that life is unfair. And here\u2019s the problem: Sure, lots of people don\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about when it comes to economics, even (especially) congressmen. But like so many other millennials, Ocasio-Cortez does not let ignorance of a subject get in the way of her certainty. Worse, she\u2019s happy not to understand, because understanding would challenge her assumptions. She doesn\u2019t want to understand costs, because then she can\u2019t campaign by promising everything that enters her stream of consciousness: Medicare for all, free college tuition for everyone, forgiveness of all outstanding student loans, a federal jobs guarantee that includes full healthcare (why is that needed, if everyone gets Medicare?),cancellation of Puerto Rico\u2019s Wall Street debt owed to \u201cvulture funds\u201d(otherwise known as \u201cinvestors\u201d who were stupid enough to loan money to Puerto Rico so that it actually had some),and an energy policy that will \u201celiminateallfossil fuels by 2035\u201dby handing out free solar panels, eliminatingallgasoline cars, and convertingallpower plants to\u2026 I don\u2019t know. Nuclear power? All of them? Who cares? The \u201chow\u201d does not matter. And it\u2019s not just economic costs to which she is blithely ignorant. She seems not to care about social costs, either. Of course she demands that ICE be abolished for doing its job, because that\u2019s this month\u2019s new thing, and we must end mass incarceration which, in her precious mind, is the cause of, rather than the result of, our urban criminal subculture that terrorizes city streets, parks, and schools. So let everyone into the country, and keep criminals mixed in with the public. What could go wrong? Perhaps to demonstrate her authenticity as a leftist, as though that was in doubt, she also gratuitously complains that Israelis \u201coccupy\u201d Palestine, even though the Israelis are themselves Palestinians (yes, they are). But when asked to clarify that remark she admitted \u201cUm..Yeah\u2026 I mean, I think \u2026 I\u2019d \u2026 also just\u2014 I am not the expert on geo-politics on this issue.\u201c OK, buther other major at Boston University was in international relations, so\u2026 In sum, New York is about to send to Congress a totally unqualified dilettante who has no notable work experience, much less experience as an elected official. Who graduated at the top of her class with a degree in economics, despite not understanding the first thing about economics. Who proposes costly things despite not having any idea how they will be paid for, or even acknowledging that they must be paid for. Who demands that law enforcement not enforce laws, and cannot fathom how this could cause any problems. And, who has no compunction about opining, with moral certainty, on complex foreign policy issues relating to countries she almost certainly could not locate on a map, even though she specialized in international relations in college, which was only a few semesters ago. Get used to it, because while Republicans are celebrating her elevation as the new face of the Democrats, she is, in all respects,the quintessential millennial, often wrong but never in doubt, and there will be more after her. This is problematic because no group of people, and it\u2019s a large group, are more convinced of their assumptions than millennials, precisely because so many don\u2019t know anything, and therefore facts don\u2019t ever inconvenience their self-perceived wisdom. So naturally they\u2019re socialists, and leftists in general, because that\u2019s easy; it doesn\u2019t require knowledge, just an understanding that all of the world\u2019s problems are caused by some combination of the Big Three Isms: racism, sexism, and capitalism.Congratulations, now you\u2019re an intellectual. And the fact that so many millennials leave college \u2014 for which they paid a lot and at which they did not learn a lot \u2014 only to find that the job market does not reward their self-esteem, simply reaffirms their conviction that the world is unfair and/or rigged, as is an economic system that rewards value, and both must therefore be modified by an increasingly authoritarian government. Great. Conservatism, on the other hand, is not so easily accessible, because it requires a certain core competency. Capitalism needs to be understood. History needs to be learned. Reality needs to be experienced, and more than that, acknowledged, even when it presents uncomfortable truths. Everything has a cost, even well-intentioned ideas. The road to Hell is paved with good intentions. Unfortunately, the rest of us are at the mercy of increasingly uninformed voters, who elect equally uninformed politicians, who wish to speed us all down that road, because at least then we\u2019ll all arrive at the same place together. And who better to put at the wheel than a millennial socialist who, like so many other millennials unable to find work in their given field, will now be employed by the government.

This author goes on and on about how capitalism has been with us for centuries, but doesn\u2019t get into what it has done to human beings\u2026\u2026\u2026. and as such the morphed capitalism that we have today is for the wealthy at the expense of everyone else. At first it was the poor, the black , who\u2019s backs were used in the Capitalistic society, now, it\u2019s pretty much everyone who isn\u2019t a billionaire.
