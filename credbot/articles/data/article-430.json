Since regaining power, the Trump administration has repeatedly claimed with false certainty that the COVID-19 pandemic originated in a lab. In late January, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavittsaidthat a lab leak is \u201cthe confirmable truth.\u201d Inmid-April, covid.gov and covidtests.gov, websites the government previously used toeducate the publicabout the disease and allow people toplace orders for free tests, redirected to a new, splashy White Housewebpagethat declared a lab leak the \u201ctrue origins\u201d of COVID-19. This month, in explaining a nearly $18 billion proposed cut to the National Institutes of Health, President Donald Trump\u2019sbudget requestfor the next fiscal year stated that a lab origin \u201cis now confirmed by several intelligence agencies.\u201d But there has been no such confirmation. In late January, the CIAjoinedthe FBI and the Department of Energy in concluding a lab origin is \u201cmost likely.\u201d But those determinations were each made with low or moderate confidence, and the agencies don\u2019t agree on the source lab.As many as five other intelligence bodieslean toward a natural origin or are undecided. Joel Wertheim, a professor of medicine at the University of California San Diego who has published research on how the pandemic began, told us the website is \u201cuntrue.\u201d As we\u2019veexplainedbefore, the origin of the coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, is unknown. Multiple lines of scientific evidence, however, point to a natural origin, with the virus spilling over into humans from animals through the illegal wildlife trade in China. That is similar to what has happened in the past, including in the early 2000s with SARS, when a similar coronavirus caused a respiratory disease outbreak that began in China. \u201cThere\u2019s overwhelming scientific evidence that COVID emerged from an animal market in Wuhan, which was miles away from a virology lab,\u201dGigi Gronvall, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security and an associate professor at the Bloomberg School of Public Health, told us. While for many scientists the evidence for a natural origin is convincing, no intermediate animal has been found harboring a virus highly similar to SARS-CoV-2, so the theory remainsunproved. Some scientists are uncertain and some favor a lab leak. It is unclear on what specific information the intelligence agencies are basing their determinations. Scientists who have studied the origins question closely have encouraged more transparency, but note that the scientific aspect of the investigation is highly technical.Michael Worobey, an expert in virus evolution at the University of Arizona who is an author of several of the major COVID-19 origins papers,toldthe Associated Press in 2023 that he doubted the individuals making the assessments \u201chave the scientific expertise \u2026 to really understand the most important evidence.\u201d OtherTrump officials have also recently endorsed a lab leak, even if they do not always frame it as definitive. Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary, for example,saidthe pandemic was \u201cprobably the result of some scientists messing with Mother Nature\u201d and that a lab leak \u201cis now the leading theory among scientists.\u201d In congressional testimony on May 15, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.statedthat multiple agencies \u201chave all agreed that NIH research almost certainly led to the pandemic.\u201d Those statements are unsupported or contradicted by available evidence. As we said, there is neither a consensus nor strong confidence among the different U.S. intelligence agencies that there was a lab leak. But one thing nearly all did agree on, according to a declassified 2023report, is that the coronavirus \u201cwas not genetically engineered.\u201d Scientists have also previouslytold usthat it\u2019s virtually impossible that SARS-CoV-2 was engineered. \u201cSARS-CoV-2 shows no evidence of being manipulated or passage[d] in a laboratory prior to its emergence,\u201d Wertheim said. \u201cThe scientific literature is emphatic on this point, with broad consensus even among scientists who disagree regarding the particulars of the location and timing of the emergence of SARS-CoV-2.\u201d There is also little to suggest that scientists now prefer the lab leak theory, as Makary said. In 2023, 156 scientists penned acommentaryin the Journal of Virology that said that the zoonosis hypothesis, or the idea that the virus spilled over to humans from an animal, \u201chas the strongest supporting evidence,\u201d while lab leak scenarios have \u201cno compelling evidence.\u201d Subsequently, another 120 scientists with the Australasian Virology Societywroteto the journal to agree. A 2024surveyby the Global Catastrophic Risk Institute also found scientists overwhelmingly favored a natural origin. Wertheim objected to Makary\u2019s characterization, noting that the \u201cpeer-reviewed literature is dominated by articles supporting a zoonotic origin\u201d while lab leak papers \u201care rare, fringe, and mutually incompatible with each other.\u201d Claims that the NIH funded work that led to the pandemic have been promoted for years. But aswe\u2019verepeatedlyexplained, the small amount of NIH grant money that went to the Wuhan Institute of Virology funded experiments using viruses that are very different from SARS-CoV-2 and could not have led to the creation of the coronavirus. When asked what the Trump administration\u2019s certainty about a lab leak was based on, and why it discounted the published research that supports a natural origin, White House spokesman Kush Desai pointed to the Intelligence Community assessments. \u201cMultiple intelligence agency assessments have now substantiated that COVID-19 originated from a lab leak \u2013 an idea that the mainstream media once completely wrote off as a lunatic fringe conspiracy theory,\u201d he told us in an email. \u201cWhile the media continues to decimate what\u2019s left of itsrecord-low credibility, the Trump administration remains committed to transparency for the American people.\u201d HHS did not respond to a similar inquiry about Kennedy\u2019s and Makary\u2019s statements. **Factually Inaccurate Website** In addition to incorrectly presenting a lab leak as an established fact, the White Housewebpagelists five numbered statements purporting to bolster its case. Each is either incorrect or misleading. We\u2019ll address them one by one (the italic emphasis in each statement is the White House\u2019s). \u201cThe virus possesses a biological characteristic that isnot found in nature.\u201dFalse. This is presumably a reference to SARS-CoV-2\u2019s furin cleavage site, or FCS, a short sequence that helps the virus enter cells. Much of the speculation about the coronavirus being lab-generated has stemmed from this site, since no other SARS-related coronavirus is known to have a FCS. But as we\u2019ve explainedbefore, the sites do exist in other, more distant coronaviruses. As a result, while unusual, the FCS isnot inherently suspicious. \u201cIt is most certainly found in nature,\u201d Wertheim said. \u201cData shows that all COVID-19 cases stem fromasingle introduction into humans. This runs contrary to previous pandemics where there were multiple spillover events.\u201dData do not show this. A Science paperpublishedin 2022, which analyzed genomic data from early COVID-19 cases, concluded that there were likely at least two spillovers from animals to humans. Wertheim, who was a senior author of that paper, said he took \u201cparticular umbrage\u201d with this claim because \u201cit was an uphill battle to convince other scientists that not only did multiple introductions occur, but that multiple introductions would be expected.\u201d \u201cWuhan is home to China\u2019s foremost SARS research lab, which has a history of conducting gain-of-function research (gene altering and organism supercharging) at inadequate biosafety levels.\u201dWuhan is home to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which worked on bat coronaviruses and genetically manipulated some of them. But there\u2019s no evidence the WIV worked on any viruses remotely similar enough to have given rise to SARS-CoV-2 (whether the experiments qualified as gain-of-function is also subject todebate). The intense focus on such issues is in many ways irrelevant, since the scientific literature is \u201cunified\u201d in concluding that the coronavirus \u201cwas not subject to manipulation or \u2018gain-of-function\u2019 experiments prior to its emergence,\u201d Wertheim said. The presence of the institute can seem too unlikely to be a coincidence, but as we\u2019ve explainedbefore, Wuhan is a hub for the wildlife trade and is home to some 11 million people. The population density is key, since a spillover in rural China would likely have simply fizzled out, Wertheim said. Much is often made about the long distance between Wuhan and where SARS-CoV-2\u2019s closest ancestors were identified in bats. But the coronavirus behind the 2002 SARS epidemic, which everyone agrees was a natural spillover, also traveled a similar distance to Guangdong. Apaperpublished in May in Cell, co-authored by Wertheim, documents the similarities between the two cases andimplicatestravel via the wildlife trade for both. \u201cWuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) researchers weresick with COVID-like symptomsin the fall of 2019, months before COVID-19 was discovered at the wet market.\u201dRumors of sick WIV workers \u2014 with various details shifting over time \u2014 have circulated since 2020, as we\u2019ve explainedbefore. But the U.S. Intelligence Community has already said that the information is not relevant to the question of how the pandemic began. Because \u201cthe researchers\u2019 symptoms could have been caused by a number of diseases and some of the symptoms were not consistent with COVID-19,\u201d the 2023 declassified reportexplains, the IC \u201ccontinues to assess that this information neither supports nor refutes either hypothesis of the pandemic\u2019s origins.\u201d \u201cBy nearly all measures of science, if there was evidence of a natural origin it would havealready surfaced. But it hasn\u2019t.\u201dThere is evidence of a natural origin; it\u2019s just not conclusive. The lack of an intermediate animal \u2014 which might prove a natural origin, and is presumably what this is referencing \u2014 does not mean that the coronavirus must have originated in a lab. As we havewritten, the wet market where the first COVID-19 cases were recognized was quickly shut down. While some animal testing occurred early on, it was primarily in species that would not be expected to be the animals that transferred the virus to humans. China has also demonstrated little to no interest in looking any further for an intermediate animal, insisting instead that the virus came fromabroad,includingfrom the U.S. \u201cEvidence of zoonosis has surfaced,\u201d Wertheim said, noting that there is now geneticevidencethat animals known to transmit SARS-like viruses were in the same part of the market where the first cases were found, with remnants of SARS-CoV-2 where the animals were kept. \u201cThis evidence is exactly what you would expect to find had a zoonotic virus emerged.\u201d That\u2019s in addition to the epidemiology data, whichshowthe earliest COVID-19 cases cluster around the market, even those without a known connection to the market. Again, all of this doesn\u2019t formally rule out a lab leak. But it\u2019s incorrect to claim that the lack of an intermediate animal is strong evidence of a lab leak.
