On Saturday, a multifaith memorial service including a jazz funeral, one of the city\u2019s most distinct traditions, paid tribute to the humanity of those coming home to their final resting place at the Hurricane Katrina Memorial. \u201cWe ironically know these 19 because of the horrific thing that happened to them after their death, the desecration of their bodies,\u201d said Monique Guillory, president of Dillard University, a historically Black private liberal arts college, which spearheaded the receipt of the remains on behalf of the city. \u201cThis is actually an opportunity for us to recognize and commemorate the humanity of all of these individuals who would have been denied, you know, such a respectful send-off and final burial.\u201d The 19 people are all believed to have passed away from natural causes between 1871 and 1872 at Charity Hospital, which served people of all races and classes in New Orleans during the height of white supremacist oppression in the 1800s. The hospital shuttered following Hurricane Katrina in 2005. The remains sat in 19 wooden boxes in the university\u2019s chapel during a service Saturday that also included music from the Kumbuka African Drum and Dance Collective. A New Orleans physician provided the skulls of the 19 people to a German researcher engaged phrenological studies \u2014 the debunked belief that a person\u2019s skull could determine innate racial characteristics. \u201cAll kinds of experiments were done on Black bodies living and dead,\u201d said Dr. Eva Baham, a historian who led Dillard University\u2019s efforts to repatriate the individuals\u2019 remains. \u201cPeople who had no agency over themselves.\u201d In 2023, the University of Leipzig in Germany reached out to the City of New Orleans to find a way to return the remains, Guillory said. The University of Leipzig did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \u201cIt is a demonstration of our own morality here in New Orleans and in Leipzig with the professors there who wanted to do something to restore the dignity of these people,\u201d Baham said. Dillard University researchers say more digging remains to be done, including to try and track down possible descendants. They believe it is likely that some of the people had been recently freed from slavery. \u201cThese were really poor, indigent people in the end of the 19th century, but \u2026 they had names, they had addresses, they walked the streets of the city that we love,\u201d Guillory said. \u201cWe all deserve a recognition of our humanity and the value of our lives.\u201d **South LA Leaders Join Smallwood-Cuevas to Launch Historic Black Cultural District** **Black History in Los Angeles Unified School District** **Black History Month: Sports Profiles** **L.A.
