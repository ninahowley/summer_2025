The Daily Scoop Podcast **Supreme Court allows DOGE to access Social Security records; Nancy Mace reintroduces federal AI training bill** June 9, 2025 The Supreme Court handed a win to President Donald Trump\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency on Friday,granting the efficiency unit access to records at the Social Security Administration. The unsigned opinion provides the Elon Musk-associated DOGE with even more access to sensitive government information to fulfill its mission of making government more efficient. Just last month, the team also gained access to payment systems at the Department of Treasury. The ruling also comes at an awkward time for the DOGE, as Musk \u2014 its creator \u2014 and Trump are in the midst of an apparent falling out on social media. Per the decision, a majority of the justices voted to grant the administration\u2019s request to stay a lower court decision and concluded that \u201cSSA may proceed to afford members of the SSA DOGE Team access to the agency records in question in order for those members to do their work.\u201d Justices voted on political lines, with liberals Elena Kagan, Ketanji Brown Jackson and Sonia Sotomayor saying they would have denied the government\u2019s application for a stay. Simultaneously on Friday, the Supreme Court handed a second win to the DOGE, shielding it from producing documents as part of a discovery process in a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit. More federal workers would have access to artificial intelligence training undera bill reintroduced in the House on Thursday by Rep. Nancy Mace. The AI Training Extension Act of 2025 aims to expand the Artificial Intelligence Training for the Acquisition Workforce Act, which was signed into law by President Joe Biden in 2022, by offering available AI training to more pools of federal employees beyond the acquisition workforce, including \u201csupervisors, managers, and frontline staff in data and technology roles,\u201d according to a release from the South Carolina Republican\u2019s office. Chair of the House Oversight Subcommittee on Cybersecurity, Information Technology, and Government Innovation, Mace previously introduced the bill in 2023 during the 118th Congress with Rep. Gerry Connolly, D-Va., who passed away last month. Rep. Shontel Brown, D-Ohio, is a co-sponsor of the reintroduced bill. The Daily Scoop Podcast is available every Monday-Friday afternoon.
