STAFF PHOTOs / DANIEL JACOBI II\u2014 The theater company, led by founder Wren Hannah, will premiere an original work, \u201cDandy in the Underworld,\u201d at CitySpace in Easthampton on Friday, May 16, and Saturday, May 17, at 8 p.m. The show, according to a press release, is an erotic horror comedy about \u201ca queer writer who wants to meet their inspirational muse but is uncertain if this seductive nymph is from their subconscious or from another dimension. Their journey to find out the answer brings them in contact with therapists, witches, writers, kinksters, and plant medicine. Expect terror, hilarity, and supernatural sex!\u201d Holy Smokes describes its mission as \u201cproducing original works that seek to comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable. Where irreverence is reverent and the profane are holy and vice versa. Affordable, adorable, accessible, irrepressible theater that is rough, raw and entertaining.\u201d The group began about a decade ago, when Hannah was living in southern New Hampshire. He and some of his friends wanted to make a \u201clow-brow, cheap, rough-around-the-edges kind of theater\u201d with improv elements, something that would be accessible to working performers as well as audiences. Their shows included a production of \u201cYoung Frankenstein\u201d staged in a bar, plus parodies of \u201cLove Boat\u201d and \u201cMiami Vice\u201d that were \u201cvery surreal and bombastic and hilarious\u201d as well as timely critiques of political and cultural issues. At the time, he said, \u201cWe didn\u2019t really have much ambition other than just creating shows that me and my friends wanted to do, so we didn\u2019t have a website. We just would put up shows, and usually they were one night only at the [Unitarian Universalist] church. But what we found is, we\u2019d put up, like, 50 chairs, and then we\u2019d have 125 people show up.\u201d His takeaway: there\u2019s \u201ca real hunger\u201d for alternative theater in the area. Hannah moved to western Massachusetts a few years ago after a few upending life events, including the pandemic, a divorce, and the death of his parents. He was drawn to the area because he \u201cwanted to be around more people, more artists, more queer people. Southern New Hampshire, as you can guess, is a little bit more homogenized.\u201d Down here, he said, he might have a unique issue: \u201cNow it\u2019s like, \u2018Oh, wow, there\u2019s two queer events in one night. There\u2019s two drag shows coming up,\u2019 whereas up in New Hampshire, there\u2019s one a year.\u201d STAFF PHOTO / DANIEL JACOBI II\u2014Kai Marigold, left, and Jupiter Dior, right, both as nymphs from the underworld, dance around Nisse Greenberg, center, as Phillip, during rehearsal for \u201cDandy in the Underworld\u201d at CitySpace, Tuesday, May 13, 2025, in Easthampton. He joined writing groups in the area, and \u201cDandy in the Underworld\u201d developed through those: as a writer, his work will often \u201cslide into dialogue, so even my poetry tends to be more like monologues from characters.\u201d The show, he said, is a \u201cgentle satire of alternative communities here,\u201d including those he himself is part of. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of spoofing them, but it\u2019s also with so much love.\u201d Initially, he ended up writing, directing, and producing his show himself because he didn\u2019t know other theater people in the area, but he finally made his inroad into the western Mass theater scene by getting involved with a local queer burlesque group, The Grotesque Burlesque, some of whose members became part of the show. Lex Grotesque, the show\u2019s assistant director, said, \u201cThe experience I have had with Holy Smokes has been wonderful. I would describe it as a theater company that embraces the queer liberation that adults in Western Mass have been waiting for.\u201d After that, growing the production came from auditions: \u201cOne of the nights, I got, like, eight people,\u201d Hannah said. \u201cSo I was like, \u2018Oh my God, this is great. Wow, really talented.\u2019 And then the next night I got, like, 35 people \u2014 \u2018Whoa!\u2019\u201d From left: Wren Hannah, Nisse Greenberg, Ezra Thalheimer, Emilia Shaw and Lindsey Schreiner perform during rehearsal for \u201cDandy in the Underworld\u201d at CitySpace on Tuesday in Easthampton. STAFF PHOTO / DANIEL JACOBI II After their first show, Holy Smokes Theatre doesn\u2019t plan to get a fixed location, but, instead to \u201cgo where there\u2019s affordable rehearsal spaces and go where I find collaborators.\u201d Right now, Hannah\u2019s working on another original show, which will be about the sudden cultural shifts of the 1960s, as experienced by a few women in a cafe. (Its potential titles include \u201cDrop Dead, Hippie Scum\u201d or \u201cTurn On, Tune In, Drop Dead.\u201d) After that, looking ahead to the theater company\u2019s future, Hannah said he hopes to \u201creally be surprised by what the needs of the community are.\u201d \u201cI\u2019d really love to keep collaborating with people and cross-pollinating with different artists and different ideas, because that\u2019s how I learn and grow \u2014 not just by dictating my own aesthetic, but being influenced by the people around me,\u201d he said. \u201cFor me, I think it\u2019s really important to create art that\u2019s accessible and affordable, but also has that balance of providing comfort and challenge, and I think both are essential.\u201d Still, he said, the purpose of theater is ultimately \u201cto entertain. You want people to come in and be instantly hooked into what you\u2019re doing and leave with something to chew on.\u201d Writer, producer and director Wren Hannah, center with red pants, leads a warm up during rehearsal for \u201cDandy in the Underworld\u201d at CitySpace on Tuesday in Easthampton.
