Prices are consistently increasing whether you\u2019re buying a gallon of gas or milk. Add in a pandemic that\u2019s affected budgets and jobs, and it\u2019s even more complex. Perhaps you\u2019ve experienced financial hardship due to job loss, unexpected medical bills, cutbacks or something else. Money and finances are the leading cause of tension in families and marriages. It\u2019s known to be at the center of some break-ups, and, with various degrees of philosophies on money management, you might find that simple day-to-day budgeting becomes an argument of its own. So how do you face financial hardships with a team attitude versus opponents? Is it possible to go through economic challenges to pull together, not apart? What if you\u2019re on the edge of losing everything and could make a list of reasons why your spouse is the cause of this detrimental point of financial legacy? Here are some ways to face financial conflicts with your spouse as a team. **Don\u2019t play the blame game.** You may have valid reasons for blaming your spouse for your current financial situation. However, if it\u2019s not a severe reason caused by dishonesty or addiction, you\u2019re likely aligned with the rest of the world in financial deficits because life happens. You might be able to pinpoint things that could\u2019ve been done differently, which is often our first conclusion. Thinking about what you could\u2019ve done to avoid this situation is instinctive. It\u2019s also a time for one spouse to center on the other\u2019s expensive way of living. Did your going-out-to-eat habit cost the family thousands of dollars last year? Perhaps it\u2019s the job loss caused by you or your spouse stepping out of bounds at work? Pointing the finger and placing blame is easy. Still, blaming isn\u2019t going to make anything better. It will add to a rift between you and your spouse, compounding the problem. So try your hardest to avoid the blame game, even if you think your opinion is necessary and valid. If you\u2019re going to work to get through this, you\u2019ll have to accept that the past is the past and move forward. **Discuss without preconceived ideas.** It\u2019s normal for one spouse to be the better budgeter, seeing where the financial holes are and comprehending what needs to happen to get through this economic hardship. However, the issue will come when you discuss finances with a preconceived notion of what you\u2019ll do. In other words, your mind is already made up on the appropriate strategy, and if your spouse brings up an opposing idea or disagrees with your plan, there will be ongoing tension and consequences. Instead,enter the discussionwith your strategies and ideas, but be willing to listen to your spouse\u2019s thoughts. Their ideas may be excellent or ridiculous, but as you talk through them as potential solutions, you understand that you\u2019re a team. Teamwork is identifying your financial strategies, being willing to compromise and listening. **Be willing to hear the ugly.** This part isn\u2019t fun, but it\u2019s necessary. It\u2019s essential to hear the brutal and ugly things you don\u2019t want to hear from your spouse, but that directly impact your financial situation. This usually comes in the form of targeting, meaning you feel targeted or attacked when your spouse brings up an item, activity, or something you believe is an essential expense but they consider a luxury. Targeting is expected when you reach the re-budgeting stage of financial hardship. For example, some women see regular salon visits for manicures or hair as necessary, making them who they are as women. Perhaps it\u2019s a necessity for numerous reasons. However, many men believe these visits are a complete non-necessity, thinking that no woman needs their hair coiffed or nails done every month. Meanwhile, the woman might feel like the man is threatening their identity, leading to a battle. Whatever you believe about salon visits, it\u2019s an example of the need to be willing to hear the tough things and consider them. Perhaps you do need monthly salon visits for your hair. Some people have hair that becomes more expensive if it\u2019s not regularly maintained. Still, if you\u2019re honest with yourself, you may realize that you don\u2019t need that bi-weekly manicure that takes 75 dollars from your monthly budget. Is it an incredible boost to your self-esteem? Yes, but is it necessary, and can you live and be happy without it? Yes. It\u2019s challenging to face economic challenges with your spouse.In the end, you must be willing to give one to the team. You\u2019ll have to swallow nasty thoughts that feel valid and realize that your strongest ally can be your biggest enemy in financial hardships, or at least you\u2019ll feel that way. You should also know that division will only enhance the breakdown of the financial security you both crave. Fear is the force behind any financial crunch. Blame, irritation, annoyance, and anger could be there too. Still, fear is the root cause of your panic when you\u2019re suddenly short of making ends meet with the bank knocking on your door while considering Ramen noodles as a meal replacement. There\u2019s no doubt that this fear is legitimate, but as believers, we must remember that God watches every sparrow and promises to provide. It may be when you need to reconsider what \u201cneeds\u201d are and return to a simplified way of life. It might be best to remove the luxuries and go back to basics. As you pull together as a team, God will show you His miraculous ways. Most importantly, you\u2019ll want to ensure that you\u2019ve put faith at the center of your financial hardship. Through obedience and prayer, you can seek God\u2019s provision. You may lose everything or feel like you have. God might not rain down prosperity, and it might feel like He\u2019s allowing catastrophe after catastrophe. If you get that feeling, look for God\u2019s leading and providing hand as a team because it\u2019ll be there. He promises. If you\u2019re working together, you can find that this situation may tie you together in ways that wealth didn\u2019t and never could. Stick together as a team and watch God provide.
