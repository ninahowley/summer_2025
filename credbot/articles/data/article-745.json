The dark comedy \u2014 which debuts Saturday evening on HBO (at 6 or 9 p.m. Mountain time, depending on your provider) and starts streaming Saturday at 1:01 a.m. Mountain time onMax (soon to be rebranded, again, as HBO Max)\u2014 centers on four tech moguls, three multibillionaires and their half-billionaire host, during what\u2019s supposed to be a luxurious guys\u2019 weekend in the Utah mountains. The fun stops when news comes in of global riots and turmoil, all blamed on misinformation generated by new social media tools just released on a platform owned by the richest of the four men (Cory Michael Smith). Smith\u2019s character, Venis (pronounced \u201cVenice\u201d), tries to minimize his responsibility, all while trying to talk his friend-rival, Jeff (Ramy Youssef), into selling his new A.I. system, which Jeff says is less prone to spewing lies and fascism. The group\u2019s elder statesman, Randall (Steve Carell), muses about how they can leverage the impending apocalypse to take over a few countries, while the house\u2019s less-rich owner, Souper (Jason Schwartzman), pitches a meditation app \u2014 as if it can help fend off the toxicity boiling out of everyone\u2019s smartphones. If the story feels close to current events, that\u2019s because writer-director Jesse Armstrong worked on a fast schedule. The \u201cSuccession\u201d creator wrote the script for his first feature film in January and February, then filming happened over five weeks, mostly in March. The movie\u2019s release date, Saturday, isthe last day of eligibilityfor this year\u2019s Emmy Awards. Central to the movie is Souper\u2019s house, named Mountainhead. The house sits at 3566 W. Crestwood Court, in the gated Deer Crest neighborhood on the northeast side of Deer Valley in Wasatch County.It made news last fallwhen it was listed at $65 million \u2014 then considered a record for a single-family home in Utah. At 21,000 square feet, the house boasts an NBA-regulation basketball court, a two-lane bowling alley and a two-story climbing wall, all of which are deployed in the movie. What\u2019s not in the movie is one of the house\u2019s signature amenities: a private ski gondola. In interviews last week, Schwartzman and Smith each said \u201cthe house is a character\u201d in the movie. They, along with Carell and Youssef, remarked on how it added to Armstrong\u2019s examination of the super-rich \u2014 a subject that fueled \u201cSuccession\u201d over four Emmy-winning seasons. The Salt Lake Tribune interviewed the actors over Zoom \u2014 Carell and Schwartzman in one session, and Youssef and Smith in another. Their comments have been lightly edited for clarity. **What makes Park City a good place to ride out the apocalypse?** Smith:Park City is adorable, and these people are not. It was nice to be in a cute, charming, sweet place. Carell:I love it there. I\u2019ve been going up there for years. My kids learned to ski up there. It was icing on the cake, in terms of doing this movie, that we got to shoot there. It\u2019s beautiful, it\u2019s serene. It\u2019s the best skiing I\u2019ve ever had in my life. The people are kind and nice. \u2026 If I could film everything in Park City, I would. Youssef:The sheer altitude, right? The whole thing is an allegory. I think about how many of us are in the comfort of our homes and watching suffering happening on our phones. And these guys are in a home that is at a much higher altitude, and the stakes of that suffering are much higher, because they\u2019re actually directly responsible for it. So there was something about that luxe isolationism that was really symbolic. **What was your impression when you first walked into that house?** Schwartzman:The first thing I thought when I walked into the house was, \u201cWhich is the first floor?\u201d Because there\u2019s not just one front door. There\u2019s many different doors. So I was always disoriented. Most houses have the main part. There were so many main parts. Youssef:It was just, \u201cWhoa. This is crazy.\u201d A few questionable design choices. Smith:There\u2019s nowhere for art to be hung \u2014 well, that\u2019s not true, but there aren\u2019t many. It\u2019s like everything is textured in material, which is just really a fascinating way to design. \u2026 I think 60% of the house is built for recreational areas. You don\u2019t need to leave. If you want to play basketball, you can play basketball on your full court downstairs. Or if you want to go rock climbing, you can go rock climbing on your wall. Or bowling, pingpong, shuffleboard. Youssef:It is so nestled in nature, despite being this incredibly man-made structure. It\u2019s the most man-made house I\u2019ve ever been in, in terms of just the sheer opulence. But then it\u2019s nestled right in the heart of nature. So that juxtaposition was cool. Schwartzman:It\u2019s so funny, that in the beginning we walked in and were like, \u201cWhoa, mama mia!\u201d Steve even said, \u201cNo one\u2019s going to think this is a real place that we\u2019re shooting in, because this house and that view are so perfect, people are going to think it\u2019s fake.\u201d \u2026 We left the house for a few days and shot at Snowbird. It\u2019s funny, we came back and I was, like, \u201cAh, home.\u201d Carell:We acclimated very quickly. We could very easily embrace the billionaire lifestyle. **Did the house help you get into character?** Carell:My character is very pass\u00e9 about all of it. Seen bigger, seen better. None of the trappings mean anything, really, to any of these guys, except maybe [Schwartzman\u2019s] character. Material things just have no meaning, the nice cars or whatever. They\u2019re so far beyond that, their lives aren\u2019t even about that. That\u2019s just incidental. Smith:Jesse [Armstrong] said this early on: \u201cWhen you walk in, there\u2019s nothing impressive about this.\u201d As the wealthiest man in the world, you\u2019re just constantly in impressive environments, so you\u2019re numb to being wowed by a $65 million overpriced piece of real estate, because it\u2019s on a mountain with its own private ski lift. Like it\u2019s cool, convenient, fun. But it\u2019s not an amazing house. [When Armstrong said] that to me early on, when I was walking in, I was, like, \u201cOh, that\u2019s just really helpful.\u201d Just for a person to have lost all sense of awe over really extraordinary things. Carell:It [has this] vastness, and there\u2019s a solitary nature to that house, too. You feel like you\u2019re away from everything in that house. It is your own world, right there. As the story progresses, and they become more and more isolated from the rest of the world, you really feel like this is their bunker, in a way. Schwartzman:It has a feeling like it\u2019s the only home there, at the top of the mountain. It has an unobstructed view, which I always found haunting in the movie. You just see the emptiness, and when we cut outside and you see the camera coming in, there\u2019s like this creeping feeling. When we read the script, the whole thing was in this house. And when they showed us the photos of the house, I was, like, \u201cThere it is. That\u2019s done.\u201d If it wasn\u2019t that house, it wouldn\u2019t have been this movie. Carell:It benefited the story and the shooting, because there were so many different places to film in the house. Different vibes, different rooms, for different types of scenes. Schwartzman:That spiral staircase that goes from floor 1 to 7 in a straight shot \u2014 it just became a weird physical metaphor of the movie for me. Kind of a downward spiral. That shape is the movie to me. This storywas produced byThe Salt Lake Tribuneand reviewed and distributed byStacker.
