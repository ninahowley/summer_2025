We don\u2019t know how that rumor got started, but let\u2019s just put an end to it right now,\u201d stated noticeably frustrated Secretary of Health and Human Services Xavier Becerra in a press release earlier. \u201cWe\u2019re still investigating just how a punk rock record became the state of Mississippi\u2019s only semblance of healthcare. But until then we want to reiterate for all citizens that, if you are having a health emergency, please make sure you have crossed state lines before expecting anyone to be able to assist you.\u201d Biloxi resident Curtis Jefferson detailed the local healthcare infrastructure his community is forced to deal with. \u201cThere\u2019s not much point in having health insurance when the closest thing your town has to a doctor is just a horse that will kick you in the mouth for an apple. That\u2019s how I tried to cure my jaundice one time \u2013 it didn\u2019t work. Arguably it made it worse,\u201d explained Jefferson. \u201cWe did have a kind of okay minute clinic up until a couple of years ago. That\u2019s when Waffle House bought the building, loaded it onto the back of a tractor-trailer and created the \u2018World\u2019s First Mobile Meth Library.\u2019 Now that that\u2019s gone it makes that horse the only game in town.\u201d In response to the EP\u2019s growing popularity with the southern medical care seekers, Laura Jane Grace went on record with a recent statement. \u201cWhile I am grateful for the enthusiasm for this batch of songs, I also want to acknowledge what a depressing hellhole Mississippi\u2019s healthcare system is \u2013 and that\u2019s not me passing judgment! Remember, I\u2019m from Florida after all,\u201d said Grace. \u201cI just want to remind everyone who has no other healthcare alternative that the album is not intended to be taken orally. You just listen to it, so please stop tweeting at me asking if the vinyl comes in other \u2018flavors.\u2019\u201d At press time, the Mississippi legislature introduced a bill transforming all of the state\u2019s remaining ambulances into casino shuttle buses. **Purchase the EP wherever you get your music:** **Hard Shoppes** Punk News Comin' Your Way!!!"}
