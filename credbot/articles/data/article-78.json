Absent a few exceptions, warrantless searches \u201careperseunreasonable.\u201dArizona v. Gant, 129 S.Ct. 1710, 1716 (2009). Regarding the reasonableness of warrantless vehicle searches, New York State jurisprudence closely tracks that of the United States Supreme Court. The inherent mobility of any sort of vehicle, be it \u201cship, motor boat, wagon or automobile\u201d has, \u201cpractically since the beginning of the [federal] Government,\u201d been sufficient to render a warrantless search of such vehicle for contraband reasonable, so long as there is probable cause to believe that the vehicle in question is in fact carrying contraband.Carroll v. United States, 267 U.S. 132, 150, 153-54 (1925). **Get amNY in your inbox!** Indeed, given the long history of a vehicle exception to the warrant requirement, individuals have \u201calways . . . been on notice that movable vessels may be stopped and searched\u201d without a warrant.United States v. Ross, 456 U.S. 798, 806 n.8 (1982). In the 85 years sinceCarrollwas decided, the courts have also held that the reduced expectation of privacy in one\u2019s automobile, as compared with one\u2019s home or office, provides further and arguably even greater support for the reasonableness of a warrantless vehicle search upon probable cause than the original justification of inherent mobility. The increased visibility of items in the passenger compartment of an automobile obviously engenders a diminished expectation of privacy in those items; they are, as a practical matter, exposed to public view. Probable causeUnder the vehicle exception to the search warrant requirement, a vehicle may be searched where there is probable cause to believe that it contains contraband, evidence of a crime, a weapon, or, in a search connected with an arrest, a \u201cmeans of escape.\u201d Nothing beyond probable cause is necessary; specifically, no additional showing of exigency is required. In cases implicating the warrant exception where the vehicle search is accompanied by an arrest, there must be a \u201cnexus\u201d between the arrest and the searchProbable cause to search the vehicle may be established in numerous ways. The owner of the car may admit, after arrest at another location, that his automobile contains evidence and contraband. A passenger who has already been removed from the car may state that the passenger left contraband in the vehicle. A confidential informant\u2019s tip that a known drug dealer will have drugs in his car can furnish probable cause to search the vehicle.Observations of the defendant\u2019s actions \u201coutside the limited time frame\u201d surrounding the arrest itself may at least help to establish probable cause for a search. Next, so long as there is probable cause to search a \u201clawfully stopped vehicle,\u201d that search may encompass \u201cevery part of the vehicle and its contents that may conceal the object of the search.\u201d Officers may, for example, engage in a warrantless search of a car\u2019s trunk, bags inside the trunk, and closed containers inside the bags. They may also search the car\u2019s glove box, and any hidden compartments within the vehicle.Circuit Holds a Search is Not a \u201cSearch\u201dNow, per the Federal Second Circuit\u2019s ruling earlier this year inUnited States v. Poller, police may use a smartphone\u2019s camera application to look inside a car with tinted windows without getting a warrant. InPoller, officers in Waterbury, Connecticut, observed an individual possibly dealing drugs from his car. After he left the car, they approached and tried to open a door, but it was locked. And the windows were tinted. But one officer then took out his iPhone and turned on the camera app and pointed the phone\u2019s lens at the car, enabling him to see through the tinted windows, and discovering what looked like two guns inside. A second officer did the same. A third officer then cupped his hands around his eyes and looked through the windshield. The officers towed the car and got a warrant to search it, recovering guns and drugs. The defendant moved to suppress, but his motion was denied.The second circuit affirmed the decision at the suppression hearing, holding \u201cthe officers did not violate Poller\u2019s reasonable expectation of privacy by using iPhone cameras to observe the car\u2019s interior through its tinted windows, and therefore did not conduct a \u2018search\u2019 within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.\u201dIf this decision seems wrong to you, rest assured you\u2019re not alone. InKyllo v. United States, 533 U.S. 27 (2001), the Supreme Court held the \u201cuse of a thermal-imaging device aimed at a private home from a public street to detect relative amounts of heat within the home constitutes a \u2018search\u2019 within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.\u201d That sounds awfully like what the Waterbury police did here, using technology to pierce a barrier and discover what normal observation couldn\u2019t. However the Circuit decided that a person has a much greater expectation of privacy in one\u2019s home than in one\u2019s automobile. Be careful out there on the road, as the right to privacy in your car is different than the rights extended to you in your home and, as of now, police in certain jurisdictions may use smartphones to search inside a window-tinted car without a warrant.The analysis of any car stop and subsequent search is always case specific.
