CEP in Your Inbox** **Afghanistan Content Report** **Afghanistan Content Report** The Counter Extremism Project (CEP) regularly compiles the propaganda output of al-Qaeda and ISIS affiliates operating in Afghanistan to help inform the public understanding of the evolving terrorist dynamics in Afghanistan. CEP's Afghanistan Content Report series ensures this raw material is available to the wider expert and terrorism analyst community, including through a rough translation of the original texts into English, which can build long-term analysis of the development of the propaganda strategies of these groups and therefore support a thorough analysis of the terrorism threat.
