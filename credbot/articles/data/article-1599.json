The letter is raising eyebrows from First Amendment and ethicsadvocates. On June 6, the state\u2019s Department of Children and Families sent the letter, claiming the reporter intimidated foster families into speaking negatively about the charity. It\u2019s a claim that the Orlando Sentinel executive editor says is completely false, and media ethics expert Kelly McBride calls inappropriate. \u201cThis is not at all within the way the constitution or the law is supposed to work, and the governor is operating way outside his authority,\u201d McBride told WMNF. McBride is the chair of the Craig Newmark Center for Ethics and Leadership at Poynter, a media institute. \u201cI don\u2019t think it will have a chilling effect. It may have the exact opposite effect, which is reporters may be emboldened to challenge the governor because its so clearly not appropriate to request that reports stop reporting,\u201d McBride said. She said the letter will bring more attention to the case. \u201cI think most of the public sees the reporting that\u2019s been done already, right? And sees that like, oh, ten million dollars was transferred to your wife\u2019s private charity. We should know more about that,\u201d McBride said. In a statement to WMNF, DCF says the Orlando Sentinel can \u201creport on whatever they want\u201d, but don\u2019t have a right to \u201charass foster families.\u201d \u201cThe grounds were laid out in the letter: Mr. Schweers threatened and harassed multiple Florida foster families, and we received complaints from those families. The Orlando Sentinel can report on whatever they want, but they do not have a right to harass foster families.\u201d DCF wrote in a statement sent to WMNF. Orlando Sentinel Executive Editor Roger Simmons told WMNF they stand by their stories and the letter was an attempt to chill free speech. \u201cWe stand by our stories and reject the state\u2019s attempt to chill free speech and encroach on our First Amendment right to report on an important issue. The state\u2019s characterization of our reporter\u2019s conduct is completely false,\u201d Simmons wrote in a statement. **OneResponse to \u201cDeSantis administration\u2019s cease-and-desist letter sent to reporter raises freedom and ethics concerns\u201d** Nino De SantisJune 11th, 2025Ron De Santis betrayed Florida and USA.
