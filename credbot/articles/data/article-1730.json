Rather than LIE to shareholders to appease Trump, they actually told the truth, and suffered for doing so, as the price of their stock dropped lower. And this was in the midst of a stock market rally today, based on last night\u2019s news that a U.S. federal court, theInternational Trade Court, ruled that Trump\u2019s \u201cEmergency Order\u201d to implement tariffs was illegal. FromMarket Watch: President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff saga took another twist late Wednesday when a U.S. trade court voided the bulk of his levies, prompting an instant appeal by the administration and sparking a rally for U.S. stock-index futures. The Court of International Trade in Manhattan ruled for a group of small businesses and Democratic-led states in finding that Trump had overstepped the bounds of his executive authority. Specifically,Trump had invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977, or IEEPA, which doesn\u2019t specifically mention tariffs, to justify the levies. Best Buy and everyone else, including myselfwith my own businesswhich is heavily dependent on imports, now are faced with trying to run a business where the rules change every day. It\u2019s called:CHAOS. And the American consumers will feel it soon enough. FromCNBC: Excerpts: Best Buy on Thursday missed quarterly revenue expectations and cut its full-year sales and profit guidance as higher tariffs increase the costs of many consumer electronics that it sells. Best Buy already increased prices on some items to blunt the costs from tariffs, with changes taking effect by mid-May, CEO Corie Barry said on a call with reporters. She called price hikes \u201cthe very last resort\u201d after the company takes other steps to offset higher expenses. But she declined to specify which items are affected, citing competitive reasons. First-quarter earnings reports have highlighted just how disruptive President Donald Trump\u2019s ever-evolving trade policy has been to many U.S. companies that rely on a global supply chain. Best Buy joins other companies like Abercrombie & Fitch and Macy\u2019s in cutting its profit outlook this week due to tariffs. Other businesses, such as E.l.f. Beauty, have declined to provide full-year guidance because of the levies. On the call with reporters, Barry referred to the latest development that may change the backdrop once again: a federal trade court striking down many of Trump\u2019s tariffs late Wednesday. And she said that ruling reinforces that the company has to stay nimble. \u201cIf you look back over the last, let\u2019s call it four months, the variety of points where there has been a change in approach to global trade, they are myriad,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd so what I really tried to work with the team on is to not actually overreact to any given moment in time, but instead to stay maniacally focused on our customers and ensure we are bringing the right assortment price and promotionality to them, whatever the backdrop.\u201d **Trump is Accelerating the Fall of the U.S. Dollar in Favor of Cryptocurrencies as He Builds his Crypto Trump Family Empire** If you don\u2019t understand this, then it will be hard for you to understand why Trump is weaponizing tariffs, even against America\u2019s allies. This is basically an all-in bet AGAINST the U.S. Dollar in favor of replacing it with Cryptocurrencies, which Trump and his family want to have total control over. Watch the video I posted above.Transcript is here. FromPBS News Hour: This week, Trump Media and Technology Group announced it is selling shares and bonds to raise $2.5 billion to create a \u201cBitcoin treasury.\u201d It marks the Trump family\u2019s latest addition to their cryptocurrency empire.

Not only can they harm you and your children with deadly vaccines and drugs, sexual abuse of their patients is far more common than most people realize. NEVER leave your child alone with a doctor, and that includes Dentists!! Even though this is getting a lot of media coverage, I assure you that the whole story is not being reported, and neither are all of the criminals being named, because it takes a very corrupt medical system to allow a doctor to do things like this, and he most certainly had partners in his crimes. The public perception of medical doctors in Western Culture wearing their white coats with a stethoscope draped around their necks, is that these are very intelligent people who only want to help people, so victims are lured into trusting them blindly, not unlike how Priests and Pastors also have many pedophiles in their ranks. FromNBC News: Excerpts: Jo\u00ebl Le Scouarnec, the former surgeon at the center ofFrance\u2019s largest-ever child sexual abuse case, was handed a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison Wednesday as his three-month-long trial reached its end. French courts convicted Le Scouarnec, 74, of sexually assaulting 299 victims over three decades,most of them girls and boys whose average age was 11. Many wereassaulted while they were under the effects of anesthesia or recovering from surgery, prosecutors said. Hundreds of witnesses testified at the trial, including Le Scouarnec\u2019s niece and a family friend. Now in their 40s, both said he assaulted them in the early 1980s. However, French law did not allow him to be prosecuted for their alleged abuse because it happened too long ago. The case has put a spotlight onthe French medical system, which allowed Le Scouarnec to continue working despite many warning signs, including a 2005 conviction for possessing images depicting child abuse. Lawyers for some of the victims said theonce-respected local doctor should have been stripped of his medical privilegesafter that case. Instead, Le Scouarnec worked across nine public hospitals and private clinics in five regions of France, where he specialized in appendectomies, abdominal and gynecological surgery. Victims\u2019 advocates also hope the case will prompt a hard look at what they call alax pursuit of child abuse allegations, particularly when doctors \u2014 who are in short supply in many areas \u2014 are accused of misconduct. \u201cThere were warnings over 30 years,\u201d Francesca Satta, a lawyer who represented 10 victims and families said previously, adding, \u201cThis man benefited from a system that opened the door for him to have his own hunting ground.\u201d Full article. **Russia Threatens to Attack Germany Now that they Know German Missiles and Troops are in Ukraine** FromSputnik: Ukraine does NOT have the technical capability to operate Taurus missiles on its own. Without German military specialists on the ground, these missiles are useless. This means Bundeswehr soldiers would directly participate in combat against Russia, says Igor Korotchenko, military analyst and editor-in-chief of \u201cNational Defense\u201d. Regardless of whether Ukraine\u2019s Taurus strikes are intercepted or hit targets, Russia\u2019s task is to \u201cretaliate with 2 Oreshnik complexes \u2014 medium-range ballistic missiles carrying 12 hypersonic warheads in total, conventionally armed.\u201d \u201cSuch a strike would target the missile production plant in Germany for total destruction.\u201d \u201cIf Ukraine continues using Taurus missiles against us, the next German military or industrial facility will be destroyed. We do not want war, we want peace. But under the UN Charter, we will act in self-defense.\u201d **Starvation and Desperation Increases in Gaza as the Genocide Continues, Affecting Mostly Children** This article was written by Human Superior Intelligence (HSI) See Also: **Understand the Times We are Currently Living Through** **Where is Your Citizenship Registered?** **The Bewitching of America with the Evil Eye and the Mark of the Beast** **Jesus Christ\u2019s Opposition to the Jewish State: Lessons for Today** **Distinguishing True Prophets from False Prophets in These Evil Modern Times** **Who Controls the World? by Dr. A.
