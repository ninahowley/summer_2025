Iraqi prime minister says Soleimani was in Iraq for mediation effort Iraqi Prime Minister Adil Abdul-Mahdi has made some shocking revelations that put the assassination of Soleimani in a completely different light. Hetold the Iraqi parliamenton Sunday that he \u201cwas supposed to meet Soleimani on the morning of the day he was killed, he came to deliver me a message from Iran responding to the message we delivered from Saudi to Iran.\u201d If this account is true, Trump \u2014 perhaps deliberately \u2014 acted to scuttle an effort to reduce tensions between Iran and Saudi Arabia. But it also shows that as the United States was signaling that it would not go to war with Iran \u2014 as Trump did earlier this summer \u2014 this compelled Saudi Arabia and the UAE to begin quiet negotiations with Iran to resolve their tension. As long as the Saudis and the Emiratis felt they could push the U.S. to go to war with Iran, they had no interest in diplomacy with Iran. The U.S.\u2019s military protection of these countries essentially disincentivized them from pursuing peace. In the past few months, under the impression that Trump had opted against war, they began careful diplomacy with Tehran. The U.S. should have welcomed this development. But the killing of Soleimani may have at the same time killed that effort and once again given Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and the Emiratis a license to continue recklessness and destabilization. Soleimani\u2019s death has unified Iran Rather than being a blow to Iran, the assassination of Soleimani has fueled nationalist sentiments in Iran and unified the political elite as well as the country. The crowds of mourners in the cities where his casket has been taken were in thehundreds of thousands, if not millions. Only a few months ago, there were widespread protests against the Iranian government, which were met with brutal force and repression. Now, Iranians are protesting alongside the government, not against it. Iraqi Parliament voted to expel U.S. forces The Iraqi parliament on Sundayvotedto expel all U.S. military forces from Iraq, as a direct consequence of the Soleimani assassination. Iraqis have tried to walk a fine balance between the U.S. and Iran, but the assassination made that balance untenable. Iraqis don\u2019t want their country to become the arena for a U.S.-Iran war, and the U.S. military presence made that risk all too likely. While many will point out that this is a victory for Soleimani and Iran, it is also important to note that this is also what theAmerican publicwants. In fact, this is what Trumppromised them he\u2019d do. The U.S. military presence in Iraq does not add to U.S. national security. Instead, it increases the threat of what would be a disastrous U.S.-Iran war. The U.S. does not need to have 5,000 troops in Iraq to assist in the fight against ISIS. Trump should welcome the vote and bring American military servicemen and women home to be with their families. Pompeo\u2019s absurd claim that war with Iranstartedwith the nuclear deal \u201cThis war kicked off when the JCPOA was entered into,\u201d Secretary of State Mike PompeotoldCNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on Sunday, referring to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. This is an astonishing statement. In Pompeo\u2019s view, the U.S. and the entire international community (save Israel, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE) entering an agreement to block Iran\u2019s path to a nuclear bomb was tantamount to starting a war. What threatens Pompeo is not war. It\u2019s peace. He is doing everything he can to ensure that tensions with Iran don\u2019t get resolved. For him, the \u201cwar\u201d to start a war with Iran started when the U.S. embarked on a path ofresolvingits tensions with Iran. Iran announces further reductions in its commitments to the JCPOA Iran has announced the fifth reduction of its commitments to the JCPOA. This is not tantamount to Iran quitting the JCPOA, as it has left the door open to recommit itself to all of the restrictions of the nuclear agreement if the U.S. lifts sanctions on Iran. (Those sanctions, it should be mentioned, are a violation of the JCPOA as well as the United Nations Security Council Resolution that embodies the JCPOA). Nevertheless, this is a step that will further increase tensions. **Share:** Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) **Tracking militarists\u2019 efforts to influence U.S. foreign policy.** Don't miss a thing, subscribe to stay updated... **Tracking militarists\u2019 efforts to influence U.S. foreign policy.** Don't miss a thing, subscribe to stay updated... \u0394 We will NEVER share your details Individuals Government Funders Organizations Media Businesses GroupWatch Archive From the Wires Right Web News Archive About The Militarist Monitor Privacy Policy Except where otherwise noted, content on this site is licensed under aCreative Commons Attribution 3.0 License Right Web Newsis a bimonthly newsletter that highlights recent and timely feature stories, profiles, and news articles added to the Right Web website.Right Web Newsis published on the first and third Wednesdays of every month.
