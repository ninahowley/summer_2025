It\u2019d also potentially a serious threat to the security of America\u2019s homeland. On Wednesday, Chris Smith (R, NJ-04) criticized the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) and the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) for forging ahead with an offshore wind development collaboration notwithstanding the acknowledged risks to national security. \u201cIt is extremely disconcerting that BOEM is only now deciding to define roles and duties with the Defense Department for offshore wind leasing and project review after 10 projects have already been fully approved by the Biden-Harris Administration with more lined up,\u201d said Smith whose district includes portions of Monmouth and Ocean counties. \u201cBOEM\u2019s ownanalysisfor the Atlantic Shores South project acknowledges that the offshore wind turbines would specifically interfere with federal and military radar systems, even mentioning Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst by name,\u201d Smith continued. \u201cAnd yet shockingly, BOEM has already issued full federal approval for construction to move forward\u2014even before reaching this new agreement to work with the Defense Department.\u201d Smith is the sponsor oflegislationwhich would effectively bar any offshore wind development projects that would \u201cweaken, degrade, interfere with, or nullify the capability of radar relied upon by the Federal Aviation Administration or the Armed Forces.\u201d \u201cAnyone who has been paying close attention to the shoddy and reckless approval process for these offshore wind projects will not be fooled by this after-the-fact proposal\u2014which is far too little and far too late. For years, we have been pointing out the lack of serious scrutiny and proper vetting for these projects\u2014especially and including the likely dire impacts on national security and military readiness\u2014but the Biden-Harris Administration has ignored our concerns,\u201d Smith added. \u201cIn fact, the implementation of this agreement so late in the process begs the question of what national security threats have been downplayed or neglected by BOEM over the past few years during its reckless, fast-track approval process.\u201d In addition to BOEM acknowledging the threat, it\u2019s been long acceptedthat turbines have the potential to impact radar for military, commercial, and personal pleasure craft. \u201cAlthough the base of the tower is stationary, the nominal area of the turbine to the radar is dynamic since the machine is constantly tracking the wind,\u201dexplainedWind Systems Magazineall the way back in 2010. \u201cWind turbines are made of highly reflective materials\u2014steel, fiberglass, and carbon fiber composite\u2014and can scatter and return a significant amount of the energy. The turbine tower is the most reflective component, but since it is constantly stationary the rotor is the largest problem to the radar. In most cases the signature can be quite large and can affect the radars/operator\u2019s ability to differentiate the wind farm from flying aircraft and weather storms. The Doppler effect is due to the moving rotor and can affect the moving target indicator of a radar.\u201d VIDEO: Rep.
