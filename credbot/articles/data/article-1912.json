John Kennedy (R-La.), a member of the Senate Budget Committee, today reintroduced the Embracing anti-Discrimination, Unbiased Curricula and Advancing Truth in Education (EDUCATE) Act, which would block federal funding for medical schools and accrediting institutions that force students to affirm ideological beliefs and prioritize diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI). \u201cMedical schools should be in the business of training our future doctors to save lives\u2014not indoctrinating students with anti-American DEI ideology. The EDUCATE Act would make sure the government isn\u2019t wasting your money on woke struggle sessions and blatant discrimination in medical schools,\u201dsaid Kennedy. Sen. Eric Schmitt (R-Mo.) joined Kennedy in reintroducing the bill in the Senate. \u201cFor too long the radical Left has used our education system to advance their woke DEI agenda rather than advancing scientific achievement. This has now injected itself into medical schools across the nation putting the lives of countless Americans in danger all to appease the woke mob. I am proud to be leading this legislation to once again put merit above social justice quotas,\u201dsaid Schmitt. Rep. Greg Murphy (R-N.C.) reintroduced the bill in the House of Representatives. \u201cAmerican medical schools are the best in the world and should remain free from discrimination, politicization, and acceptance of anything other than excellence. The EDUCATE Act bans race-based mandates at medical schools, protects the First Amendment and civil rights of students, and promotes objective, science-based medicine. Excluding individuals based on appearance or beliefs in the name of diversity is wrong and debases the integrity of the profession. Doctors must be taught to treat patients with the highest quality of care regardless of who they are. This includes dealing with other medical professionals who may not look like they do. I have dedicated my life to serving others as a physician and will not stand for discrimination in our nation\u2019s institutions of medicine,\u201dsaid Murphy. Kennedy and Murphy also authoredthis op-edin the Washington Examiner urging Congress to pass their EDUCATE Act. The EDUCATE Act would block federal funding from medical schools that: Direct, compel or incentivize students, faculty or staff to affirm or adopt certain ideological tenets. Take any action that would deprive a student of educational opportunities or otherwise adversely affect his or her status as a student on the basis of race or ethnicity. Require a course of instruction that directs or compels students, faculty or staff to state, pledge, recite, affirm or adopt certain ideological tenets. Maintain a DEI or equivalent office within the medical school. Require or incentivize an individual to complete a diversity statement that affirms or capitulates to DEI as a condition of the person\u2019s being admitted to or employed by a school. Do No Harm, America First Policy Institute, Eagle Forum, Heritage Action and CPAC support the EDUCATE Act. \u201cDo No Harm applauds Congressman Murphy and Senator Kennedy for their relentless work to end harmful DEI practices and to restore integrity to American medical schools. For too long, accrediting bodies and medical colleges have prioritized identity politics over merit and expertise\u2014putting patients\u2019 health at serious risk. President Trump\u2019s Administration has taken critical steps to dismantle these political activists\u2019 grip on medical education, even causing some accreditors and schools to suspend their discriminatory practices. But the EDUCATE Act could enshrine the President\u2019s actions into law, thereby eradicating DEI programs from medical education permanently,\u201dsaid Dr. Stanley Goldfarb, founder and Board Chairman of Do No Harm. \u201cDiversity Equity and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives are an offshoot of Critical Race Theory\u2014designed to promote race-stereotyping, race-exclusion, and indoctrination into divisive far-left ideologies. When publicly funded universities and medical schools teach students to make snap judgments about each other and our broader society based on skin color, they are conditioning them to reject foundational American commitments, including equal treatment and opportunity for all, administrative impartiality, and due process. Congressman Murphy\u2019s bill is an essential first step toward restoring academic excellence and truth-seeking as the focal points of medical education so that tomorrow\u2019s health professionals are prepared to provide exceptional care to every patient, regardless of their race or sex,\u201dsaid Dr. Michael Shires, Ph.D., Vice Chair of Education Opportunity at the America First Policy Institute. \u201cDEI has invaded US medical schools like a virus in recent years\u2014harming these institutions and the public as well. Senator Kennedy\u2019s EDUCATE Act is the cure. We urge the Senate to move this bill forward,\u201dsaid Kris Ullman, President of the Eagle Forum.
