With temperatures near the 90-degree mark, your A/C is about to get its first real good workout of the season. Here's the expert advice: don't wait for something to go wrong; call now for the annual tune-up. \"It's a small investment to be comfortable during the hottest days of the month. Make sure it's running as efficiently as possible,\" said an A/C repairman. The $100 you spend on the annual tune-up could keep you from paying a lot more later on this season.. The technician will clean and inspect the coils, check refrigerant levels, inspect electrical connections, and replace air filters. Even if you're not increasing your use of power, the price of energy is increasing due to increased demand from summer heat waves, AI data centers, and bitcoin mining, among other things. And when you're talking numbers, 78 degrees is the recommended temperature for saving money in the summer months, but that doesn't mean it's the best temperature for keeping cool. HOW TO BEAT THE HEAT \"If you do convince your family to turn up the AC, using a ceiling fan or box fan can make up the difference; running one will actually make the room feel as much as four or even five degrees cooler,\" said Dan Wrocklawski, Consumer Reports. Add some technology to your home in the form of a smart or programmable thermostat; they make it easy to set a money-saving, energy-conserving schedule. \"Using a programmable thermostat is really the most effective way to save money, and it\u2019ll even help you save money on heating bills in the winter,\" said Wrocklawski. **Related Articles** Who covers the cost?
