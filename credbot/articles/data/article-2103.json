It is an impressive, sweeping, and thought-provoking narrative.\u201d\u2014Dennis Meadows, coauthor,The Limits to Growth \u201cRichard Heinberg is a writer of unfailing interest and this book sums up much of his life\u2019s thinking. Understanding our dilemma in terms of power is, well, a powerful way for getting at the predicaments and possibilities of this fraught moment in our evolving history as a species.\u201d\u2014Bill McKibben, author ofFalterand co-founder of 350.org \u201cRichard Heinberg\u2019s panoramic review of known forms of power is both sobering and inspiring. Given our species\u2019 habitual methods for getting its way, be these methods physical, mental, or social, the outlook for our future is bleak indeed. Yet, Heinberg allows for the slim but real possibility of exercising restraint. If we are so persuaded, by wisdom or love for beauty, the future even now remains open. Indeed, such restraint returns us to ancient, almost forgotten appetites and capacities.\u201d\u2014Joanna Macy, author,World As Lover, World As Self \u201cA profound, rigorous, convincing, and actionable lesson on how to understand power less as the control one has over others than as the collective capacity we have to share with one another. A rich, moving, and necessary treatise from our most accomplished, coherent, and compassionate thinker on sustainable futures. This can still be accomplished.\u201d\u2014Douglas Rushkoff, author,Team Human \u201cHeinberg goes to the very heart of the issue. Using his immense knowledge of biology, science, history, psychology. and the politics of energy, he shows that the environmental and social crises we face today have in their origin the insatiable human pursuit (and often abuse) of power, in all its forms.\u201cIn showing us the path forward, Heinberg guides us to achieve power-limiting behavior so that we can not only survive but thrive on a healthy planet and in healthy balance with one another.\u201d\u2014Maude Barlow, cofounder, The Blue Planet Project \u201cI\u2019ve thoroughly enjoyed readingPower. It brings a half century if scholarship and thinking into clear focus.\u201d\u2014David Orr, Paul Sears Distinguished Professor of Environmental Studies and Politics Emeritus, Oberlin College \u201cPower: Limits and Prospects for Human Survivalis sweeping in scope and a powerful presentation. Richard Heinberg is willing to face the harsh reality of multiple, cascading social and ecological crises without flinching, and he has written a comprehensive book offering readers a framework moving forward that isn\u2019t based on wishful thinking. Drawing on his decades of activism and research, Heinberg explains why power and energy are central concepts for understanding the human predicament and shaping our future.\u201cEqual parts science and philosophy, history and contemporary analysis, Power is more engaging than a scholarly tome and more thoughtful than journalism. Heinberg\u2019s book is a model of public scholarship about life-or-death challenges to human societies.\u201c\u2014Robert Jensen, Emeritus Professor, University of Texas at Austin \u201cPoweris an extraordinary tour de force. It is a comprehensive compendium of how it has emerged, despite our self-proclamation to be sentient beings, that we now find ourselves scrambling on the edge of a cliff. Ironically this perilous rock-face is one that we ourselves have created. As a species, spurred on by the power of our migrant curiosity, we have exploited the immediate opportunities of the natural world while blindly discounting the future. But our planet keeps score \u2014 and fortunately so does Richard Heinberg.\u201cPoweris a must-read. It is a call to action for those seeking a sustainable, balanced, human future in harmony with the Earth. No guarantees, of course, but harnessing the power of sentient action certainly beats the alternative: of continuing our blind stumble only soon to be swept aside, as have many creatures before us.\u201d\u2014Peter Whybrow, author,The Well-Tuned Brain: Neuroscience and the Life Well-Lived \u201cPoweris Heinberg\u2019s masterwork. And it could not be more timely, arriving just as that window of time for action threatens to slam shut. Ignore this book at your peril.\u201d\u2014Stan Cox, author,The Green New Deal and Beyond \u201cPowerserves as a Rosetta Stone to decipher how our species went from one of many to apex predator in a very short time. A necessary book to fully understand the imperative that our species return to \u201cright relation\u201d in this critical time.\u201d\u2014Peter Buffett, composer and philanthropist \u201cHeinberg\u2019sPoweris a searing, unflinching revelation of what has driven us to our current existential crisis: humanity\u2019s quest for power. Impeccably researched and masterfully written, this book explains how and why humanity is driving itself off the cliff. If there is any hope for us to continue, Heinberg shows why it must come from efforts to limit our own power.\u201d\u2014Dahr Jamail, author ofThe End of Ice: Bearing Witness and Finding Meaning in the Path of Climate Disruption \u201cPoweris Richard Heinberg at his synthesizing best. In this sweeping volume, he deftly links raw energy \u2013 essential for anything to happen in the physical world \u2013 to the exercise of political power in the cultural domain.\u201cIf the productive use of energy to expand is the ultimate key to evolutionary success, then humanity has no equal on Earth. But energy is also the ultimate source of material success, society\u2019s addiction to economic growth and the international power politics that are destroying the planet. InPower, Richard Heinberg asks whether we can avoid catastrophe. Will competing nations\u2019 primal lust for power give way to high intelligence, mutual trust, and unreserved cooperation in the quest to salvage civilization? Not a trivial question \u2013 failure would deny humanity the chance to advance another rung up the evolutionary ladder.\u201d\u2014William E. Rees, FRSC, Professor Emeritus, University of British Columbia; co-originator of the ecological footprint concept \u201cPowerreminds us that Richard Heinberg is one of the most important public intellectuals in the conversation about society\u2019s future. Eminently readable and engaging,Poweris breathtaking in its scope and insight. Heinberg persuasively argues that we have reached evolutionary limits to concentrated social power and that empathy and beauty are key to averting ecological and social catastrophe.\u201d\u2014Chuck Collins, Institute for Policy Studies, author,The Wealth Hoarders: How Billionaires Pay Millions to Hide Trillions \u201cI turn to Richard Heinberg whenever I need to understand something about energy; he\u2019s the \u2018go-to\u2019 source. And now this!Power, with seamless fluency in paleo-history, economics, psychology, and politics, is the \u2018must-read\u2019 for anyone wondering how we can make it through the 21st century. This book is more than informative. It is enlightening. It is essential. It is powerful!\u201d\u2014Suzanne Moser, climate researcher and consultant \u201cA delight to read, it has a number of sobering messages for policy makers and politicians alike\u2026 Setting this book apart from virtually all others covering the topic of energy transition and climate change is that Heinberg covers power in all its manifestations\u2026 A sobering and timely book just as many governments appear to acknowledge \u2013 after decades of inaction \u2013 the dangers of climate change.\u201d\u2014EEnergy Informer \u201cIt may be a moral idea that hard work pays off but if we need proof that it counts, this latest of Richard Heinberg carries all the evidence we need. His encyclopedic treatment of power is brilliant. It is sure to pop up in courses and living rooms like toast.\u201d\u2014Wes Jackson, Founder, The Land Institute Share Tweet Email Print Share viaFacebookTwitterPinterest Facebook Twitter Pinterest Facebook Twitter Pinterest **Podcasts** **Resilience.org** **Support Us** **Follow Us** **Contact Us** Post Carbon InstituteP.O.
