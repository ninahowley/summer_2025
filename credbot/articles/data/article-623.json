The Lady Dragons earned their first 13th Region Tournament win (at least going back to available KHSAA records through 2001) with a 6-2 victory over Knox Central on Monday at Corbin.\u201cWhen coach (David Overbay) and I got here four years ago, that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been working toward \u2013 the region and be able to come down here and compete. We\u2019ve come close the last two years,\u201d Harlan assistant coach Scott Lisenbee said. \u201cWe had never been two years in a row, and now it\u2019s three, so we finally broke through. We\u2019re happy for these girls, but as we like to say we aren\u2019t done.\u201dSenior first baseman Abbi Fields led the 18-8 Lady Dragons with two-run homer in the second inning and an RBI single in the fourth inning. Addison Jackson had a double and single. Ella Farley and Ella Lisenbee added two singles each. Jordyn Smith, Jalynn Wynn and Addison Campbell contributed one single each.\u201cAbbi was big tonight with that shot that I think is still going,\u201d said Lisenbee. \u201cShe kept us off balance at times with the changeup, but we did enough to win.\u201dSmith was in control in the circle as she gave up two runs on five hits with six strikeouts and no walks. The Lady Dragons were also solid defensively with only one error.\u201cI\u2019m super proud of Jordyn. The way she has progressed from last year to this year is amazing,\u201d Lisenbee said.Harlan ran itself out of scoring in the first inning despite hits from Farley and Smith as both were cut down on the bases.Jackson opened the second with a single and trotted home on Fields\u2019 blast to left-center. Wynn and Campbell followed with one-out singles, then Gracie Hensley walked to load the bases. Farley drove in a run with a line drive into center that turned into a fielder\u2019s choice when Hensley was forced out at second.Lisenbee singled to open the third and came home on Jackson\u2019s double. Ava Nunez pushed the Harlan lead to 5-0 with a sacrifice fly.Knox\u2019s Jayme Swafford tripled in the fourth inning and scored on Hannah Milton\u2019s hit.Harlan got the run back in the bottom of the inning as Smith walked, moved to second on Lisenbee\u2019s hit and scored on a single by Fields.Aubrey Jones singled for Knox in the seventh inning and scored the game\u2019s last run on a hit by Emily Jordan.Harlan will play Jackson County in the regional semifinals on Tuesday at 8 p.m. as the Lady Dragons seek another first by advancing to a regional championship game for the first time.\u2014\u2014\u2014Knox Central 000 100 1 \u2014 2 6. 3Harlan 032 100 x \u2014 6 11.1Castle and Melton; Smith and Jackson.
