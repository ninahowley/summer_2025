Banks,Syracuse University President Donald Trump ordered a contingent ofabout 700 Marinesto Los Angeles on June 9, 2025, in response to what Secretary of Defense Pete Hegsethdescribed as\u201cincreased threats to federal law enforcement officers and federal buildings.\u201d This dramatic escalation of the military presence in Los Angeles followed Trump\u2019sJune 7 order to send about 2,000 National Guard troops into the city. Both measures wereTrump\u2019s responseto what he called \u201cnumerous incidents of violence and disorder\u201d by those protesting his administration\u2019s actions rounding up and deporting immigrants in the Los Angeles area. State and local officials decried Trump\u2019s actions, with California Gov. Gavin Newsom calling the move \u201cpurposefully inflammatory,\u201d as well as \u201can illegal act.\u201d California sued the Trump administration on June 9to block its deploymentof National Guard members. Other critics of Trump\u2019s actions said the scale and character of the protestsdid not warrantsuch extreme measures. Amy Lieberman, a politics and society editor at The Conversation U.S., spoke withWilliam C. Banks, a scholar of the role of the military in domestic affairs, to understand the extent of a president\u2019s power to send American troops to Los Angeles. Can American troops be used inside the country? They can, but it is an extraordinary exercise of authority to use troops domestically. It has rarely been done in the U.S. as a way of responding to a civil disturbance. Congress has delegated that authority of deploying American troops domestically to the president in limited circumstances. Otherwise, the only authority is exercised by governors, who have control of the National Guard. Why was American law set up this way? The U.S. was founded in response to heavy-handed English use of the military by King George to interfere with the civil liberties and rights of the colonists in the lead-up to the American Revolution. So, when the founders created the U.S. Constitution, they were very careful to insert roadblocks that would make it difficult for the government to use troops to carry out its own programs. The country\u2019s framers also understood there might be occasions when it would be necessary to use the military domestically. They did a couple of things to control the exercise of military authority. One was to ensure that the commander in chief of the military was a civilian. Second, they gave the authority to call up the National Guard, what was known as the \u201cmilitia\u201d in those days, to Congress, not to the president, in order to create a separation of powers. Under what circumstances can the president deploy troops to an American city? Under theInsurrection Act, which was signed into law in 1807, a president can deploy troops during what is called an insurrection, simply meaning when all hell breaks loose. The president can decide that it is \u201cimpracticable,\u201d according to the Insurrection Act, to enforce the laws of the U.S. in a given city, and he may call forth the military or the National Guard to help restore law and order. In order to invoke the Insurrection Act, the president first has to make a proclamation to those he calls the insurrectionists to cease and desist. Unless the alleged insurrectionists immediately do what the president says, the president then has the authority to deploy forces. Trump has repeatedlycalled the protestersin Los Angeles \u201cinsurrectionists,\u201d but has also walked those remarks back and hasn\u2019t made any kind of formal proclamation yet. When Trump ordered California\u2019s National Guard members to deploy to Los Angeles on June 7, he did so on a narrow statutory authority to protect federal buildings, properties and personnel that were trying to enforce immigration laws. What is the Posse Comitatus Act and how does it apply to the current situation in Los Angeles? Congress passed thePosse Comitatus Act in 1878. This act\u2019s name derives from anarcane Latin termthat means \u201cthe power of the county.\u201d This law establishes a legal presumption in the U.S. that the military, if it is deployed domestically, should not engage in law enforcement. This act is an important part of American law. It means that the military and National Guard are trained on this principle that they are not to engage in domestic law enforcement activities. Those are reserved for police, sheriffs and marshals. Invoking the Insurrection Act is the principal exception to this law. So the Insurrection Act allows the military to act as law enforcement officials? That\u2019s right. By invoking the Insurrection Act the military could act as cops and have the right to arrest, investigate and detain civilians, with only the Constitution as a check on its power. This is not a situation that California National Guard members have trained for. They are trained to fight actual wildfires, but this is something entirely different. Are there any legal roadblocks that could curb the president\u2019s authority to send U.S. troops to Los Angeles? The short answer to this question is no. Can state governors or other elected officials prevent U.S. troops from being sent to their cities? In many ways that is the main question right now. California\u2019s governor, Gavin Newsom, has said that thestate doen\u2019t needthese military forces. Newsom\u2019s June 9lawsuit against the Trumpadministration argues that the authority over the National Guard is reserved for states, \u201cunless the State requests or consents to federal control.\u201d That has not happened in this case.
