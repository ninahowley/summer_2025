School Board of Leon County, Florida. This case was brought by Florida parents after school district officials secretly met with their middle school daughter to develop a \u201cgender support plan\u201d that let her choose what name, pronouns, and restrooms she would use, and with what sex she would be housed on overnight trips. The Eleventh Circuit\u2019s panel held that the Littlejohns failed to state a claim. It also reasoned that the application of the school\u2019s \u201cgender support plan\u201d through its \u201cLGBTQ+ Guide\u201d did not \u201cshock the conscience\u201d because the school meant to \u201chelp the child.\u201d Kniffin\u2019samicus brief, filed in support of the Littlejohns\u2019 petition to rehear the case en banc, argues that the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s panel decision incorrectly applies prior precedent and fails to recognize the violation of the Littlejohns\u2019 fundamental constitutional right to direct the care of their child \u2014 regardless of whether that violation passes a subjective test of \u201cshock[ing] the conscience.\u201d Eric Kniffin is a fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center, where he works on a range of initiatives to protect and strengthen religious liberty as part of EPPC\u2019sAdministrative State Accountability Project.
