Share Why are traditional climate solutions falling short in the American South? on Twitter (X) Share Why are traditional climate solutions falling short in the American South? on Facebook In Brunswick, Georgia, a predominantly Black community lives in the shadow of industrial facilities, where decades of conventional environmental advocacy have failed to create meaningful change. This isn\u2019t just an anomaly. It\u2019s a pattern repeated across the American South, where traditional climate solutions often overlook the complexities of environmental impact, public health, and community prosperity. From industrial pollution to basic infrastructure, the environmental burden on Black communities in the South often manifests in health disparities: The area from Baton Rouge to New Orleans has been dubbed Cancer Alley due to its abundance of petrochemical plants and refineries.The census tract within this area (St. John Parish) has thehighest cancer riskfrom industrial air pollution in the United States \u2013 more than seven times the national average While Alabama\u2019s Black Belt makes up less than 0.2% of the U.S. population,it accounts for over12%of Americans lackingbasic water and plumbing systems Nationally, Black Americans are more likely to die from stroke than white Americans \u2013but that disparity is between6% and 21%higher in Southern states However, these communities have gained a fighting partner in their corner. In Atlanta\u2019s Partnership for Southern Equity (PSE), a nonprofit organization that advances racial equity and shared prosperity in the American South, an innovative new approach to environmental justice is emerging. Nathanial Smith, founder and Chief Equity Officer of PSE, puts it bluntly when asked why he thinks Black communities are disproportionately impacted. \u201cFor people in particular communities of color, racism is the social determinant of health,\u201d says Smith. \u201cRacism has facilitated environments that continue to harm historically disinvested communities of color.\u201d Smith\u2019s organization aims to change the South\u2019s attitude towards environmental issues affecting marginalized communities and is already producing measurable results by connecting environmental justice directly to community health and generational wealth. This is how PSE is taking action. **The Battle For Brunswick** Brunswick has 14 sites on Georgia\u2019s Hazardous Sites Inventory\u2014including four Superfund sites (areas designated by the government to contain chemicals toxic to humans), more than any other Georgia city. The danger these sites pose was illustrated in November 2023, when a chemical fire at the Pinova plant sent hazardous plumes of smoke across nearby neighborhoods, forcing residents to seek shelter. \u201cA lot of times poor communities have to choose between their health and their pocketbooks,\u201d says Smith. \u201cThere\u2019s this perception that it\u2019s going to be a job creator for the community. But unfortunately, those jobs can create years of illnesses or the companies may not hire within the community like they said they would.\u201d It\u2019s long been suggested by residents that these sites were detrimentally affecting their health, but it wasn\u2019t until PSE worked with Emory University\u2019s Rollins School of Public Health that the data showed what was truly going on. Researchers from the university analyzed blood samples from 100 long-term Brunswick residents. Theresults, published in early 2024, showed elevated levels of multiple cancer-causing toxic substances. Risk for higher exposure was elevated for individuals who are Black, older, work at industrial facilities like LCP Chemicals or Hercules, or live with someone who did. Most telling was the presence of Aroclor 1268, a toxic man-made chemical linked specifically to Brunswick\u2019s industrial sites. The findings confirm long-held fears for community members like local doula Wendy Brown. \u201cMy son was playing soccer and they practiced next to a Superfund site. How did we know? Because one day a fence came up,\u201d she recalls. \u201cIs my son contaminated? I don\u2019t know. But they\u2019re going to tell me now.\u201d Brown, who works with expectant mothers in the local area, points to Georgia\u2019s troubling maternal health statistics \u2013 the state ranks46thnationally in healthcare and has an infant mortality rate of 6.25 deaths per 1,000 live births, which is higher than the national average of 5.6. In Brunswick, these health outcomes are even worse than the state\u2019s already poor averages. All of this evidence has sparked a movement. Researchers are now seeking to expand the study to 500 participants and examine potential health impacts. For PSE, the data provides communities with hard evidence to advocate for change\u2014transforming generations of speculation into actionable proof of environmental injustice. All of this evidence has sparked a movement.Researchers are now seeking to expand the study to 500 participants and examine potential health impacts. But PSE\u2019s approach goes beyond just gathering data\u2014they\u2019re helping communities use this information to advocate for real, comprehensive change. Working with local partners like Coastal Community Health and the Environmental Justice Advisory Board, they\u2019re creating a model where environmental cleanup, healthcare access, and community empowerment work together. Now healthcare providers are being trained to recognize pollution-related health issues, while community members are learning to document and report environmental violations. **Restoring Black Excellence In Sweet Auburn** In the heart of Atlanta lies a stark reminder of how poorly planned infrastructure can harm community prosperity. Sweet Auburn Avenue, once dubbed \u201cthe richest Negro street in America,\u201d stood as a testament to Black entrepreneurship and resilience during the Jim Crow era. Here, Black-owned insurance companies, banks, and entertainment venues created a thriving ecosystem of commerce and culture. Then came the highway. In the mid-1960s, the Interstate 75/85 \u201cdowntown connector\u201d tore through Sweet Auburn. The construction displaced an estimated 30,000 residents and dealt a deadly blow to the district\u2019s vitality. With no direct highway access to Auburn Avenue, traffic was deliberately diverted around the community. Bustling storefronts were replaced by empty lots and boarded-up buildings. This physical divide created by the highway resulted in decades of disinvestment and disregard, marking the end of Sweet Auburn\u2019s golden age. \u201cSweet Auburn was an extremely vibrant and important community to the Black nation,\u201d Smith explains. \u201cBut in the eyes of white leadership, they still considered it blighted, which they used as an excuse to build a highway through Auburn Avenue.\u201d Today, a coalition of organizations is working to heal this rift. PSE has joined forces with Perkins & Will and Nelson\\Nygaard in the Reconnecting Sweet Auburn Project, an initiative funded by Invest Atlanta, Sweet Auburn Works, and the Atlanta Downtown Improvement District (ADID). The team has set specific goals: documenting the long-term negative effects of the highway construction using hard data about physical infrastructure, environmental conditions, and demographic changes. They\u2019re also studying successful examples nationwide of how other divided communities have rebuilt and reconnected. In late 2024, the project took a major step forward, applying for an $800,000 Reconnecting Communities Pilot Grant to advance their design recommendations. The project also aims to deliver immediate, community-led design interventions to improve quality of life while developing longer-term strategies to reimagine Sweet Auburn\u2019s relationship with the highway that divided it. This includes the chance to reconfigure existing infrastructure, like streets, ramps, and bridges, to make the neighborhood more livable and attract new investment. The challenge now is ensuring Sweet Auburn\u2019s revival benefits its existing community rather than pushing them out. As neighborhoods improve, rising property values often displace the very residents who weathered decades of disinvestment. But Smith is confident in his community-first approach. \u201cWe believe that a resilience agenda cannot be fully realized without a healing and repair agenda,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about beautifying places\u2014it\u2019s about healing people and positioning people to be successful.\u201d **A Data-Driven Path Forward** PSE\u2019s approach has already shown concrete results. In Atlanta, where 90% of major job centers are located north of Interstate 20 while many underserved communities live south of it, the organization achieved its first major policy win by expanding public transportation. Working with faith communities and young people, PSE launched \u201cThe Power of the Penny\u201d campaign, convincing residents to support a one-cent sales tax for transit expansion. The initiative secured over 70% voter approval, creating a $13 million fund to extend MARTA (Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority). This wasn\u2019t just about transportation \u2013 with more cars sitting in traffic due to a lack of accessible transit options, Atlanta\u2019s carbon footprint was expanding and residents, especially children and seniors, were suffering from increased air pollution. PSE\u2019s success demonstrated how addressing transportation equity could simultaneously tackle environmental justice and public health. PSE\u2019s success offers a clear blueprint for addressing environmental challenges across the South. Their model, supported by Skoll Foundation funding, demonstrates how combining health data, community leadership, and environmental advocacy creates measurable change. This approach has already helped over a hundred organizations secure $60 million through former President Biden\u2019s Justice 40 Executive Order, showing how local successes can scale to regional impact. \u201cEquity is love in action,\u201d explains Smith. \u201cWe can\u2019t facilitate an environment where all people have a chance to reach their full potential if we\u2019re not courageous enough to love everybody.\u201d This philosophy drives PSE\u2019s commitment to ensuring communities lead their transformation, from fighting utility rate increases that burden low-income residents to developing the South\u2019s first equity mapping tool. For PSE, the future is about continuing to expand its impact across the South while staying true to its core principle that those closest to problems are closest to solutions. Their experience shows that successful environmental justice work requires more than just data and policy change \u2013 it demands creating spaces where local community members can unite to build a more equitable future. This story was reported as part of a partnership with the Skoll Foundation. Through their support of social entrepreneurs tackling society\u2019s most urgent challenges, they\u2019re helping organizations like PSE create lasting, systemic change for those who need it most. Visit Skoll.org to explore more stories of impact. Social innovation offers a transformative approach to tackling global crises by empowering those closest to the problem. Unlike top-down solutions, it fosters collaboration between communities, businesses, and governments to create scalable, lasting change. In healthcare, training local health workers has improved rural medical access, while Indigenous groups have used technology to protect rainforests. By rethinking possibilities and challenging the status quo, social innovation paves the way for systemic solutions that drive meaningful progress. In the American South, systemic disinvestment has left Black, Brown, and Indigenous communities vulnerable to environmental hazards. In Brunswick, Georgia, Black neighborhoods face toxic Superfund sites and recurring disasters like a 2023 chemical plant explosion. The Partnership for Southern Equity (PSE) is rethinking what\u2019s possible, mobilizing communities for environmental justice. Rooted in Dr. King\u2019s legacy, PSE is driving policy change and proving that when equity leads, transformation follows. Indigenous Peoples are guardians of the world\u2019s forests, playing a vital role in preserving these crucial ecosystems. But as their land rights and livelihoods come under increasing threat, these defenders are standing strong, fighting for the land and working with organizations like Global Witness to expose the institutions responsible for its destruction. By shedding light on the financial institutions backing companies like JBS, Global Witness is exposing the impact of environmental damage and aiding defenders in their fight to protect and preserve our planet\u2019s forests. **** About Freethink Partner with Us Careers Pitch Us Video Library Series Playlists Just Might Work Challengers Hard Reset Catalysts Artificial Intelligence The Digital Frontier Energy The Changing World Order Consumer Tech The New Space Race Materials Biotech The Best in Bionics We <3 Space DIY Technology Interviews That Might Change Your Mind youtubeSubscribe to our Youtube Channel instagramView our Instagram feed Visit our Facebook page View our Twitter (X) feed Privacy Policy"}
