It is now under consideration in the Senate and Trump ispressuringsenators to pass it without major changes. Aside from cutting taxes by trillions for the wealthy, kicking 15 million people off health care, and cutting food aid for the poor, the bill provides an unfathomable amount of additional money to fund Trump\u2019s draconian mass deportation agenda. In just a few months, Trump\u2019s deportation troops have repeatedlyarrestedanddeportedthe wrong people,including U.S. citizens; sentinnocent people to gulagsdesigned for terrorists in third countries;separated familiesand turned children into orphans;detained high school honors students; and engaged in countless other heinous actions. The bill provides $155 billion in new immigration enforcement funding\u2014more than five times the amount of current funding\u2014to supercharge the ability of the Trump administration to carry out more actions like these, as well as further militarize the border and build more miles of the border wall, put immigrants in new and expanded prisons, and carry out worksite raids across the country. Altogether, asFigure Ashows, Trump would have $185 billion for immigration enforcement, and this doesn\u2019t include additional appropriations that Congress could pass in future years. Even with all that spending, there isn\u2019t one new cent in the bill that would go to ensuring that wages and working conditions are protected by increasing funding to the federal agencies that hold lawbreaking employers accountable. In fact, the $185 billion Trump could have at his disposal to carry out his radical immigration enforcement agenda would be 80 times more than the annual government funding for labor standards enforcement. That disparity alone tells you all you need to know about how little the Trump administration prioritizes working people. The data below can be saved or copied directly into Excel. The data underlying the figure. Notes:The total for 2025 existing funding for immigration enforcement, not including new funds via reconciliation, includes funding for U.S. Customs and Border Protection, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and the Office of Biometric Identity Management, all of which are in the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Notes:The total for 2025 existing funding for immigration enforcement, not including new funds via reconciliation, includes funding for U.S. Customs and Border Protection, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and the Office of Biometric Identity Management, all of which are in the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Totals for labor standards enforcement are for fiscal year 2023, adjusted for inflation to 2025 dollars using the CPI-U, and include appropriations for all subagencies, administrations, and offices of the U.S. Department of Labor considered for \u201cworker protection\u201d in budget documents, including the Employee Benefits Security Administration, Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs, Wage and Hour Division, Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, Office of Labor\u2013Management Standards, Occupational Safety and Health Administration, Mine Safety and Health Administration, and the Office of the Solicitor, in addition to two other agencies not within the Department of Labor: the National Labor Relations Board and the National Mediation Board.

Copy the code below to embed this chart on your website. Let\u2019s take stock of this new funding that would help Trump turn the country into an authoritarian police state. First, the reconciliation bill provides $27 billion for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents and operations. This would nearly triple the agency\u2019s funding and make ICE the highest-funded law enforcement agency in the entire federal government. Giving ICE more funding than any other law enforcement agency toviolate due processat an even grander scale won\u2019t help anyone, however, becausedeportations don\u2019t improve workers\u2019 wages and working conditions. It\u2019ll unquestionablymake workplace conditions worse, while giving ICE the ability to do much more of what they\u2019ve already been doing\u2014namely, covering their faces andkidnapping studentswho are in the country lawfully, as well as going afterlabor organizers,university scientists, and even sometimes construction workers who areU.S. citizens. The bill also provides $45 billion to spend on new and expanded immigrant detention centers through September 30, 2029, nearly quadrupling ICE\u2019sdetention budget on an annualized basis. As one analyst recentlypointed out, the federal Bureau of Prisons currently has an annual budget of $8.3 billion, so ICE\u2019s annual budget for immigrant detention would be nearly 50% larger than that of the entire federal prison system. And then there\u2019s $83.2 billion in new funds for border enforcement and construction of Trump\u2019s border wall. That includes $8.3 billion for Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents, vehicles, and facilities, $6.3 billion for border surveillance technology and vetting, and $51.6 billion for border wall construction. Another $5 billion would go to the Department of Defense (DOD) for so-called \u201cborder operations,\u201d meaning the deployment of military personnel and the temporary detention of immigrants on DOD installations. And right before the bill passed, an additional $12 billion was added to reimburse states for money they\u2019ve spent on border enforcement (most of which would likely go to Texas to reimburse the state government for things like barriers and razor wire they installed in the Rio Grande). In addition to mind-blowing levels of new government spending for detaining, deporting, and terrorizing immigrants, House Republicans also included punitive new taxes and fees on immigrants. They added a 3.5% fee onremittances(money sent abroad) paid by people who are not U.S. citizens, which would also turn staff at places like Western Union into de facto immigration enforcement officials because they would have to check their customers\u2019 immigration statuses. House Republicans also voted to impose exorbitant fees on applications that immigrants file with the U.S. government. For example, people seeking relief in immigration court would be charged hundreds of dollars in new fees, and people who are the subject of immigration enforcement actions would be charged thousands. Those seeking asylum, who currently do not have to pay a fee to apply for humanitarian protection, would be required to pay a new $1,000 filing fee. The ultimate result is that asylum protections would all but disappear for children and people in detention who can\u2019t work. Those not in detention would have to pay a new $550 fee every six months for their work permits\u2014and people withparole and Temporary Protected Statuswould have to pay this new fee, too. A new $8,500 up-front fee for sponsors of migrant children would mean that the vast majority of children in government shelters might end up detained for lengthy periods. These are just a few examples froma long list. And finally, the bill neither improves the immigration system nor helps workers. The bill only spends $1.25 billion on the immigration court system. Investments in judges and staff would speed up adjudications on benefits and deportations and make the immigration process fairer and timelier relative to the status quo, where people with legitimate claims are left in limbo for many years about whether or not they can remain lawfully in the United States. This is a drop in the bucket compared with what\u2019s needed. And despite the Trump administration\u2019s manyclaimsthat they want to help U.S. workers, the Republican budget bill provides exactly zero new dollars to federal agencies that protect workers\u2014even though these agencies\u2019funding has been flat or decliningfor decades while workers are beinghurt, killed, androbbedon the job at alarmingrates. It spends zero on agencies that check if workplaces are safe. It spends zero to fight illegal child labor. And it spends zero dollars on the agency that enforces safety and health rules for people who work in mines. To add insult to injury, the Trump administration is working hard toreduce staffat those agencies andfiringtheir leadership, as well. The senators who vote in favor of taking this bill one step closer to becoming law will be turning their backs on workers while plunging the United States into a dark new era of authoritarianism, extreme and intrusive surveillance, and a new national network of internment camps.
