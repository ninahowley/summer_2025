The library is deeply grateful for the bank\u2019s support in making this possible. Water, water, everywhere but here Hear me out, I\u2019m going to bring up the \u201cP\u201d word. During the pandemic, the library\u2019s drinking water fountain rusted out, and it started to leak. We turned it off and placed the dreaded \u201cOut ofOrder\u201d sign on it. One of my goals in 2024 was to identify and land a grant to replace the water fountain. Lucky day The library\u2019s lucky day came when Fidelity VP/Banking Center Manager Tracy Sasseville visited the library to introduce herself and ask if we needed anything. The Youth Services Librarian requested and received the \u201cSsspectacular\u201d Snake program, and the snake-themed gift bags with bookmarks and slap bracelets were a big hit. But when Sasseville visited, I had already received an initial quote to replace the old water fountain with a bottle filler, so the library was prepared to seize the opportunity to enhance the library experience for our patrons. Fidelity Bank\u2019s support for the new water fountain at Richards Memorial Library reflects their deep commitment to community well-being. As they put it, \u201cGiving back to the communities we serve is important to Fidelity Bank, and helping people stay hydrated is just one more way to show we care.\u201d This generous donation not only enhances the library\u2019s offerings but also ensures that visitors can stay hydrated and refreshed while enjoying the resources the library provides. The bank\u2019s contribution demonstrates its dedication to supporting local initiatives that positively impact residents. Drink up! Please join Richards Memorial Library and Fidelity Bank for the official unveiling of the water bottle filler drinking fountain at 6 p.m. Tuesday, March 4. There will be a short presentation, free water bottles, and some fun swag. Community Partnership Richards Memorial Library is pleased to have a community partner in Fidelity Bank.
