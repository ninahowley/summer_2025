He had just been at the center of the Cougars\u2019 three goals in 2:12 to end the frame \u2013 the first a feed to AJ Clark, the second a turnover caused by Brian Delaney that eventually led to a Clark goal, the third that the pole Toomey finished off himself. At that juncture of the PIAA Class 3A semifinal, it didn\u2019t much matter to Toomey who was on the other bench at West Chester Henderson High. It certainly didn\u2019t matter how strong its occupants started the game. There was just Springfield, playing the brand of lacrosse it knows best, the opposition just scenery in the Springfield story. The Cougars overcame a three-goal deficit early to win going away from La Salle, 9-5, and book a place in the PIAA final on Saturday. It avenges a loss to the Explorers in this game last year. It sets up a rematch of the District 1 final, which Springfield won over Radnor. The Raptors took the westerly journey to State College, beating Shady Side Academy, 13-8, Tuesday. Springfield (23-1) trailed 3-0 after one quarter. It tied the game three times before taking its first lead on Clark\u2019s goal with 12.5 seconds left in the third at 6-5. Clark\u2019s goal two minutes earlier was set up by Toomey, off a caused turnover by fellow defenseman Talen Varrasse, who led the way in that category with four. His second was a set play off a long possession, Clark popping to the right of the cage to make himself an option as Patrick Flaherty dodged behind. Tommy Rush, who just about stalemated La Salle\u2019s faceoff man Christian Peterman with a 7-for-16 day, won the draw and pushed it to Brad Barber. Barber found a streaking Toomey, who caught it in stride and whipsawed it home to make it 7-5 after three. \u201cThat felt awesome,\u201d Toomey said. \u201cAll the momentum shifted our way. And it kind of felt like the game was in our hands at that point. It didn\u2019t matter what they were doing. It only mattered what we were doing. And we just kept it rolling.\u201d Two goals created by Springfield\u2019s defense augmented the domination in its usual half of the field. The Cougars conceded only two goals in the final three quarters to the District 12 champion. They allowed just two shot attempts after halftime, goalie Jackson Kennedy not having to add to his first-half save total of four. For Toomey, the challenge was fixing excessive aggression in the first quarter \u2013 a little too jumpy on passing lanes, slightly over-pursuing dodgers. La Salle can exploit mistakes. But dare their offensive talents to make plays 1-on-1 against a structured defense, and the Explorers (18-6) don\u2019t quite have the difference-makers. \u201cWe know we\u2019re good at pressing and trying to take the ball away,\u201d Toomey said. \u201cBut against a good team like that, sometimes going all out trying to get the ball back isn\u2019t the best idea. So we definitely had to reel that in.\u201d Billy Henderson followed Varrasse with three caused turnovers. LSM Brian Delaney and middies Zach Wisely and Luke Valerio caused a turnover each. La Salle punished them early. Attackman Will Trymbiski scored twice in the first half, one set up by brother Jackson Trymbiski, who had a goal. Logan Riggione, the only one of La Salle\u2019s vaunted midfield corps to find the score sheet, scored the final goal of the first quarter, and Will Trymbiski\u2019s goal with 24 seconds left in the first half sent the Explorers into the break leading 4-3. Flaherty (three assists) scored his only goal to tie it at 4, but Will Trymbiski untied it 41 seconds later. Clark got them back on level terms in starting that third-quarter spree. That it\u2019s Clark, one of the Cougars lower on the scouting report, stepping up in big moments with two goals is an indication to Barber the team that they\u2019ve built. \u201cI remember in the offseason, we were getting ready for the year, AJ was such a big factor,\u201d Barber said. \u201cHe was having an incredible offseason. We know he was going to make plays like this. It doesn\u2019t surprise anyone, not one player on our team or coaching staff. He\u2019s built for those moments. And it was awesome to see that for him.\u201d Springfield hardly let La Salle get a touch in the fourth quarter. The Explorers responded with frustration in the form of four penalties, the third of which led to Flaherty feeding Evan DiBlasi to make it 8-5. Brad Barber fired his third goal with 3:29 left to set off the celebrations. Even for the offense that powered it, those celebrations came back to the defensive side of the ball, to those whose fingerprints are on everything. \u201cIt\u2019s a dream. It\u2019s awesome,\u201d Barber said of playing in front of that unit. \u201cThat\u2019s why I think our offense is able to do what we do, because we have the defense to back us up, we have the goalie, we have Tommy Rush. We have all the pieces, and we\u2019ve got one more game, so hoping to get it done.\u201d **Share this:** Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Facebook Click to share on X (Opens in new
