Noting that the 3.5% increase was \u2018well above\u2019 the current CPI rate, business industry spokesperson Jeremy Fadden said the ruling meant workers would essentially be getting free money. \u201cAll this is doing is providing millions of Australians with excess money to buy luxuries like groceries and rent, or three litres of petrol\u201d. He said the new wage rate was unworkable and has called for it to be scrapped. \u201cHow can corporations be expected to run their businesses if they are forced to pay their workers enough to live off? It\u2019s not sustainable\u201d. Fadden said a more cautious approach was required. \u201cWe\u2019d all love to get paid more \u2013 I mean, I haven\u2019t had a pay rise since 2021, and that was only a 4% raise, or $26,000 a year. We all need to make sacrifices and think about the impact this will have on the economy\u201d. Like this?Support The Shovel.
