Scroll below to watch our latest Public Service Announcement. Today, almost 2 million individuals \u2013 disproportionately Black Americans \u2013 are incarcerated in our nation\u2019s prisons and jails. The prison population has grown 500% since 1973, the year America began to sharply increase its prison population. America\u2019s 50-year experiment with mass incarceration has been a profound moral and policy failure, perpetuating cycles of despair and retribution, tearing apart communities, and destroying countless lives. Billions of taxpayer dollars are poured into this failed system that seems designed to perpetuate itself. It is a profound tragedy that should stir the conscience of our nation. Watch the video above to hear from formerly incarcerated activists, Kemba Smith and Jo\u00e9l Cast\u00f3n, on why it\u2019s past time for our country to WAKE UP! **Take Action** Learn MoreGet the facts on mass incarceration and explore research and advocacy webinars to promote public safety and racial justice.Learn more **Learn More** Get the facts on mass incarceration and explore research and advocacy webinars to promote public safety and racial justice. **Learn More** Get the facts on mass incarceration and explore research and advocacy webinars to promote public safety and racial justice.
