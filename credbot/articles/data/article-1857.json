For more than 45 years, Los Angeles has maintained a policy where local police do not arrest illegal immigrants or act to determine a person\u2019s immigration status. Democrat Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has characterized ICE\u2019s lawful actions as sowing \u201cterror in our communities\u201d and disrupting \u201cbasic principles of safety in our city.\u201d She told KNBC-TV on Friday that \u201cwe are going to fight for all Angelenos whether they have papers or not.\u201d \u201cAfter the first night [in Los Angeles], when we actually listed the individuals that were arrested, when you have known suspected terrorist gang members, drug dealers, and yet people still want to advocate to allow these individuals to stay in our community and stay in the country,\u201d Lyons said. \u201cThe political rhetoric just puts none of us at ease, and it makes none of us safe. You would not expect this from elected officials.\u201d Some politicians, such as Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., have insinuated that ICE agents were indiscriminately snatching people off the streets without due process. Lyons said that is far from the truth. \u201cPresident Trump ended catch and release, and [ICE] agents and officers are now allowed to do their sworn law enforcement mission,\u201d Lyons said. \u201cAnd like any other local police department, state trooper, we can\u2019t walk away from someone that\u2019s committing a crime.\u201d He added, \u201cIf your status is no longer valid, if your visa is no longer valid, it\u2019s been revoked or a judge has lawfully ordered you deported from the United States, we are not just going to walk away from you and give you a second bite at the apple.\u201d \u201cYou have already had your due process rights. If you haven\u2019t, you will go in front of a judge again and have your chance to appeal it. But we\u2019re not going to walk away from an immigration violation anymore.\u201d Lyons also shot back at politicians who have described the riots in Los Angeles as peaceful with protesters simply exercising their First Amendment rights. \u201cWhat you saw is pure anarchy and lawlessness,\u201d Lyons said. \u201cBeing on the ground here in Los Angeles and actually seeing it firsthand and watching my officers and agents get assaulted from Friday night all the way through until LAPD got control of the city.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s been a real violent situation, and this all stemmed from ICE doing its duty, law enforcement duty, serving a criminal immigration warrant. \u2026 It was an actual federal law enforcement critical criminal warrant signed by a judge that we were executing that led to this.
