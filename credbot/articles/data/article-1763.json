FromRemittances: Illegal Immigration\u2019s Hidden Tax: To be clear, it\u2019s impossible to know exactly how much money illegal immigrants remit annually. There are three reasons for this. First, we don\u2019t know how many illegal immigrants actually reside in America. Second, the term remittance itself is ambiguous: should we include money stuffed in a birthday card in our calculations? Third, we cannot track the location of every dollar even if we wanted to (if we could, black markets wouldn\u2019t exist). Nevertheless, I think we can apply a set of reasonable assumptions to a reasonable dataset, and reach a reasonable conclusion as to just how much money illegal aliens remit annually\u2014although we cannot hit a home run, we can at least bat in the right ballpark. Let\u2019s step up to the plate. First, assume that all of America\u2019s remittance outflows are either sent by first-generationlegalimmigrants, or illegal aliens. Next, assume that these two groups send equal amounts of money home per person. Although legal immigrants earn more per capita, they likely send a much smaller proportion of their pay abroad (if they send any at all). I think these are fair assumptions. Now, let\u2019s apply those assumptions to the numbers. According toPew Research\u2019s 2018 remittance outflow data, America lost $138.2 billion in remittances in 2016. And given that there are some40 million first generation immigrants, and (at least)11.1 million illegal aliens, this means that there are roughly 51.1 million people sending remittances abroad. Of course, the number of aliens is debatable: arecent study from Yale Universityfound that there were at least 22.8 million illegals residing in America. That being said, let\u2019s go with the low number for the sake of argument. Dividing the total remittance outflows by immigrant proportions reveals that illegal aliens likely remit some $30 billion per year. That\u2019s a lot of money. For context, it\u2019s as much as the entire annual GDP of Vermont. And of course, the figure would be higher if we used Yale\u2019s population estimates. But it\u2019s not just about the money\u2014it\u2019s what\u2019s happening to it. Remember when I said earlier that no matter how bad Paris\u2019 taxes were, at least the money paid for French, rather than Russian, harlots and maestros? Remittances are worse. Every dollar remitted by illegal aliens is a dollar ejected from the local economy, never to recirculate or be reinvested\u2014it goes directly to Russia, or more likely Mexico, China, and Guatemala. This reduces the velocity of money, and causes liquidity problems, particularly in small towns. Functionally, there\u2019s little difference between remittances and federal taxes: taxes skimmed from small towns pools in Washington DC, while remittances sent by aliens line Carlos Slim\u2019s pockets. It\u2019s that simple. And yet allegedly anti-tax organizations like theCato Instituteroutinelyargue in favor of open borders, not seeming to grasp the necessary implications. It\u2019s time we stopped speaking in jargon. Let\u2019s call out remittances sent by illegal aliens for what they actually are: a tax.
