SUMMARY This is AI generated summarization, which may have errors. For context, always refer to the full article. KING SLAYER. Alas Pilipinas spiker Marck Espejo attempts an attack over the South Korea defense in the 2025 Alas Pilipinas Invitationals. PNVF MANILA, Philippines \u2013 Test event or no test event, Alas Pilipinas is taking its home court defense seriously ahead of the 2025 FIVB Men\u2019s World Championships. Two days into the three-day Alas Pilipinas Invitationals, the Philippine men\u2019s volleyball team took down another Asian powerhouse, dragging the Korean V-League champions Hyundai Capital Skywalkers to a four-set finish, 25-22, 22-25, 25-21, 25-20, at the Araneta Coliseum on Wednesday, June 11. Alas captain Marck Espejo pulled out the big guns in his entry to the starting lineup, tallying a game-high 20 points on 17 attacks, 2 aces, and 1 block as his team remained undefeated in the no-bearing, yet crucial showcase to flesh out the hosting kinks before the massive 32-nation world tilt in September. Fellow 2019 Southeast Asian Games silver medalists, the returning libero Jack Kalingking and young setter Owa Retamar, also showed off, with the former tallying 9 excellent receptions while the latter recording a game-high 3 blocks for a 4-point total. Up just 15-14 in the fourth set against a rallying Hyundai squad, Alas leaned on a pair of UAAP MVPs from Ateneo \u2013 reigning winner Ken Batas and five-time awardee Espejo \u2014 towards a 5-1 breakaway for a 20-15 lead, also helped up by two attack errors from the Korean side within the run. Not fully able to prevent errors stifling their comback attempt, the Skywalkers only got as near as 22-19 before Peng Taguibolos hammered an off-the-block kill, 23-19, followed by an Espejo backrow bomb for match point, 24-19. Soon Won Geun saved one match point, 24-20, but it was too late for another Korean rally as Lee Jae Hyun gifted the win off a service going wide. The stiff challenges don\u2019t stop for the world championships host as Alas wraps up the test event on Philippine Independence Day Thursday, June 12, with a hopeful repeat conquest of the mighty Thailand national team, still at 7:30 pm at the same venue.\u2013 Rappler.com How does this make you feel? **author** **JR Isaga** **{{ item.sitename }}** **{{ item.title }}** **Alas Pilipinas makes quick work of Kiwis, sets sights on unbeaten Kazakhs in AVC** **Alas Pilipinas opens Invitationals with 4-set thriller win over champion Indonesia club** **Schedule, lineup, standings: Alas Pilipinas in 2025 AVC Women\u2019s Volleyball Nations Cup** **Hanoi heartbreak: Alas suffers first loss in AVC Nations Cup as Iran sneaks in 5-set thriller** **Alas Pilipinas makes quick work of Kiwis, sets sights on unbeaten Kazakhs in AVC** **Alas Pilipinas opens Invitationals with 4-set thriller win over champion Indonesia club** **Schedule, lineup, standings: Alas Pilipinas in 2025 AVC Women\u2019s Volleyball Nations Cup** **Hanoi heartbreak: Alas suffers first loss in AVC Nations Cup as Iran sneaks in 5-set thriller** **Alas Pilipinas makes quick work of Kiwis, sets sights on unbeaten Kazakhs in AVC** **Alas Pilipinas opens Invitationals with 4-set thriller win over champion Indonesia club** **Hanoi heartbreak: Alas suffers first loss in AVC Nations Cup as Iran sneaks in 5-set thriller** **Alas survives Solomon exit in comeback win vs Indonesia, climbs to 2-0** **BTS members Jungkook, Jimin discharged from South Korea military** **IN PHOTOS: BTS\u2019 RM, V discharged from mandatory military service** **In first event since double Olympic gold coup, Carlos Yulo leads PH team in Asian meet** **South Korea\u2019s new President Lee vows to revive democracy from \u2018near demise\u2019** follow us Crowdfunding Subscribe to Newsletters Founding board Rappler board of directors About Us Mission Statement Editorial standards and guidelines AI GUIDELINES The Team Topics directory Rai chatbot Contact Us Privacy Statement Terms of Use Community Guidelines NPC Registration NPC Privacy Seal Philippine elections Checking your Rappler+ subscription...
