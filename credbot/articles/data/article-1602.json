The second season, released May 2025, explores the world of shortwave radio: the lesser-known cousin of AM and FM radio that travels thousands of miles across rough terrain and geopolitical borders. This once-ubiquitous medium went from a utopian experiment in global communication to a propaganda tool for governments at war \u2014 and then became a vehicle for American right-wing extremists and cults. Katie visits a verystrangestation in Northern Maine. And explains what a little-known battle playing out on the shortwaves right now \u2014 between radio fanatics and Wall Street \u2014 can tell us about how we value our public airwaves. Micah goes behind the scenes with Katie \u2014 to hear about her reporting process, how she found these stories and audio recordings (some of which had never been digitized), and the talk radio and shortwave gems that were left on the cutting room floor.
