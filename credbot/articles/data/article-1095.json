This downgrade means that for the first time ever, all three major credit ratings agencies have downgraded U.S. credit below their top rating. Moody\u2019s warning comes as lawmakers are considering budget reconciliation legislation that would make America\u2019s fiscal situation significantly worse. The new report from Moody\u2019s downgrades the U.S. credit rating from the top level of Aaa (negative) to Aa1 (stable). In its announcement, Moody\u2019s stated the following primary reasons for doing so: Growing debt caused by increased federal spending and reduced revenues from tax cuts.Moody\u2019s includes the assumption that extension of the 2017 TCJA provisions will add $4 trillion to the debt over the next decade. Growing federal interest payments, driven by rising interest rates.The cost of financing the U.S. debt has increased rapidly, driven by higher Treasury yields since 2021. In particular, Moody\u2019s continues to warn that \u201csuccessive US administrations and Congress have failed to agree on measures to reverse the trend of large annual fiscal deficits and growing interest costs. . . . In turn, persistent, large fiscal deficits will drive the government's debt and interest burden higher. The US' fiscal performance is likely to deteriorate relative to its own past and compared to other highly-rated sovereigns.\u201d The two other major credit rating agencies, Standard & Poor\u2019s (S&P) and Fitch Ratings, haveboth already downgraded the nation\u2019s rating\u2014 S&P in 2011 and Fitch in August 2023. S&P and Fitch Ratings also recognize the risk presented by growing debt and political division for the U.S. outlook. WhenS&P lowered the sovereign credit rating for the United States more than a decade ago, it noted weakening \u201ceffectiveness, stability, and predictability of American policymaking and political institutions\u201d as well as an insufficient fiscal stabilization plan for the medium-term. The 2023 downgrade from Fitch Ratingscited the nation\u2019s high and rising debt, the lack of a plan to address the drivers of that debt, and the erosion of good governance. Sovereign credit ratingsassess the capacity and willingness that a borrower will default on its debt obligations. Now, all three major rating agencies have lowered their ratings for U.S. debt, reflecting deep concern about the United States\u2019 growing debt and deficits. These serious and credible warnings should send a strong message to policymakers about the need to addressAmerica\u2019s unsustainable fiscal path.
