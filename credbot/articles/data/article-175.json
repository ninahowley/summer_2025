Like State Farm, Allstate is only quoted through the company's captive agents, and they do not insure structures with more than four units. **Compare Homeowners Insurance Companies** **What Home Insurance Won't Cover** While uncommon, some homes are uninsurable. This would include homes in certain fire zones and lava zones. Beachfront properties (depending on the distance to the ocean) can be insured, but only with higher premiums for lower coverage limits. Not all insurers offer coverage for high-risk areas. The exact rules vary between policies. This is why it's critical to work with an insurance agent you trust and review your policy documents. An all perils home insurance policy will cover damage caused by anything that's not specifically excluded in the policy documents. With decades of claims and underwriting experience, insurers list exclusions from lava and hurricanes to riots, war, nuclear hazards, and government action. So read carefully before assuming specific incidents will be covered under your home insurance. If you choose a named-perils policy, you may get the cheapest home insurance rates available to you. As you might expect, insurers only cover damage associated with perils listed in the policy documents. So the risk of unpaid claims is higher. In short, if your named perils policy covers damage from fires, lightning, and explosions, you would not be covered if a car crashed into your home unless it caused an explosion. Similarly, you decide what property coverage you want up front. Dwelling coverage (the cost to repair or replace your home if destroyed) is a constant, particularly if you have a mortgage. Many other coverages are optional. Homeowners who want thecheapest home insurance rateswhen shopping for homeowners insurance might skip personal property coverage. Investors renting properties out might also skip personal property coverage while increasing liability coverage. If a covered peril damages your home, though, you would then be responsible to replace furniture, clothing, electronics, and any other personal property. **Home Insurance Companies Won't Cover Neglect or Intentional Damage** The exact breakdown of coverage varies between home insurance companies. No matter where you buy, there are two exclusions with no exceptions. Neglect: Neglect is one of the most common reasons for denials of claims. If you have a leaky toilet that goes unchecked, it could slowly leak for months or years. This would lead to floor rot,mold, and other long-term damage. Insurers expect homeowners to maintain the property and prevent damage where possible. This is why many companies will not cover vacant homes. Vacancies mean no one is on location to catch major incidents or small leaks. Intentional damage: A home insurance company may refuse coverage for certain types of vandalism and destruction. This is specific to homeowners and legal residents. As a general rule, policyholders are not meant to profit from insurance plans. Insurance should restore what was lost to its state prior to the claim. When homeowners or residents intentionally damage or destroy the property, insurers view it as an attempt to profit and an extra hazard. This leads to greater scrutiny and can escalate to claims being denied. Particularly if you have renters or boarders, make sure to discuss coverage with your agent. **How to Find The Most Affordable Home Insurance for You** Mortgage lendersrequire borrowers to buy a homeowners policy covering the cost to rebuild your home. This estimate is based on the appraisal or your insurance agent's estimated replacement cost matrix. Some homeowners are also required to pay for regional coverage such as flood, hurricane, or earthquake. Unless you specify otherwise, the lender will then collect a small amount each month to pay your premium for you once a year. Keep in mind, all insurance notices will be sent to you automatically. So if prices go up or you want to switch for any reason, you have control over your homeowners insurance. Important note:Your insurance company will still send you notices when payments are due, if payment is missed, etc. DO NOT ignore these as your mortgage company can buy its own (much more expensive) policy if yours lapses. The cheapest home insurance is not always the most affordable. Homeowners insurance quotes give buyers a preview of what they may pay each year. But this doesn't account for the cost of claims or how much you could pay out of pocket if your claims are denied or your insurer drags out the process. When shopping for home insurance, we balance cost with performance and coverage. **Homeowners Insurance Companies with the Highest Customer Satisfaction** The Better Business Bureau accepts a company's customer complaints and reviews advertising and transparency about business practices. Once a complaint is submitted, companies can respond and resolve the issues. The BBB ranking does not guarantee great rates or that you'll love the company. That's why we also looked at average rates, reviews from sites like TrustPilot, and sample plans to compare coverage options. However, a company with a high BBB rating is more likely to stay above board and address consumer issues. USAA's limited availability makes it impractical for organizations like JD Power or the BBB to rank it alongside companies that sell to a more diverse range of users. However, many of our top home insurance picks maintain the BBB's highest ranking. When combined with strong JD Power, AM Best rankings, reviews from real homeowners, and advice from our expert panel, we feel confident saying our top picks are also trustworthy home insurance companies for the average consumer. **Why You Should Trust Us: Our Expert Panel for The Best Homeowners Insurance** We spoke to a variety of experts to inform our picks for this best home insurance guide, and to give readers additional advice for finding the right policy. You can read what they had to say later in this guide, under the Experts' Advice section. **The Experts' Advice on Choosing The Best Home Insurance for You** We worked with a realtor, homeowners insurance agent, and mortgage loan originator to discuss what buyers should consider when buying home insurance. You can find their full commentary below. **What do you believe are the most important things to look for when buying home insurance?** Lina Roby, Former Insurance Editor with Personal Finance Insider Homeowners should take into account both coverage and price. Critical riders like water backup coverage cost you as little as a few dollars per renewal period while saving you thousands in the event of a claim. When calculating your monthly mortgage costs, the right homeowners insurance ensures your home also fits your budget. Stephanie Andrews, Realtor with Keller WilliamsHawaii Dream Homes Homeowners should have complete coverage without too many stipulations or exceptions. Jeremy Yang, Homeowners Insurance Agent withIFG Insurance LLC Details of the policy are important. Ex:Replacement Cost vs Actual Cash Value coverage/endorsement like water backup coverage. Chelsie Sorino, Mortgage Loan Originator with CF Home Loans LLC I believe is most important to look for when buying homeowners insurance is making sure that your coverage is truly comprehensive. A named peril policy provides coverage ONLY for the select types of damages listed in the specific policy. On the other hand, a comprehensive peril policy makes getting insurance to cover any incident much easier. **How should I set my deductible amount?** Lina Roby, Former Insurance Editor with Personal Finance Insider Consider how much you can afford to spend in the event of a claim? If you cannot afford to spend $1,000 out of pocket to deal with a major flood, for example, a $1,000 deductible may lower your monthly premium, but it's too high. Stephanie Andrews, Realtor with Keller Williams Hawaii Dream Homes Your deductible should match your income and available cash on hand. Having a larger deductible will save you money, but if you can't afford to pay a large deductible when you need the insurance, then the extra savings don't matter. Jeremy Yang, Homeowners Insurance Agent with IFG Insurance LLC Your deductible should be based on claim history & affordability. If you have no claims history and are not likely to file claim, you can raise your deductible. But understand that the deductible will be the out-of-pocket amount if any claim are filed. Chelsie Sorino, Mortgage Loan Originator with CF Home Loans LLC Low deductible plans require higher monthly premiums but lower out of pocket expenses. High deductible plans provide lower monthly premiums but higher expenses in the event of an insurance claim. You should choose a deductible that balances out your monthly and out-of-pocket costs in the event of a claim. **What are the most common things buyers miss when buying home insurance?** Lina Roby, Former Insurance Editor with Personal Finance Insider Many homeowners underestimate the importance of riders. All they see is extra costs. The bulk of your monthly premiums is spent on dwelling coverage, personal property, and other key parts of homeowners coverage. The devil is in the details, especially when it comes to homeowners insurance riders. Stephanie Andrews, Realtor with Keller Williams Hawaii Dream Homes Not getting enough coverage for a complete rebuild, not checking for specific coverage like flood or hurricane, and not looking at the conditions of the insurance. Jeremy Yang, Homeowners Insurance Agent with IFG Insurance LLC Most buyers will choose the cheapest insurance, which might leads to homeowners being underinsured. Getting insurance with not enough coverage is like driving a car with a drawing of a seatbelt on your shirt. Chelsie Sorino, Mortgage Loan Originator with CF Home Loans LLC Equipment breakdown coverage is something that I see buyers missing when buying homeowners insurance. This is an easy & affordable rider. Common examples of covered equipment being air conditioning systems, furnaces, heat pumps, heaters, and kitchen & laundry appliances. **How We Chose the Best Home Insurance Companies** Sites like J.D Power, user review sites, and other sources play a role in our reviews, as do policy documents. While we cannot look at every policyholder's documents, most home insurance companies have specific coverage limits and benefits applicable to all standard policies. To come up with our list of the best home insurance companies, we also considered common exclusions and the impact on the average homeowner compared to average premiums. We take into account customer experience and the claims experience. While homeowners hope to never experience a partial or full loss of their home, most do. Finally, we factor in financial stability. Regardless of size, insurance companies walk a tight line between premiums coming in and claims payments going out. We look for insurers likely to be around for the foreseeable future. For a full breakdown of ourinsurance rating guidelines, click here. **FAQs** **Do most people have homeowners insurance?** Yes, most people have homeowners insurance. If you have a mortgage, your lender will require home insurance. In most cases, your homeowners insurance invoices will be sent to your lender, and it will add costs to your monthly payments. Among homeowners who own their home outright, most still have insurance to protect against the unexpected. **Is it worth having an umbrella policy for home insurance?** An umbrella policy offers a boost in coverage for multiple policies with one premium. If you're bundling your homeowners and auto insurance policies with one company, raising your liability limits on each policy could be costly. Whether you're in an auto accident or your dog bites the mailman, the ensuing claim can be costly, especially if you don't have sufficient liability coverage. **How much home insurance coverage do I need?** At a minimum, homeowners need replacement coverage for the structure. In short, your insurance company runs a cost assessment to estimate the construction cost for replacing your home if it were completely destroyed. More importantly, check your coverage exclusions, add-ons like water backup coverage, and personal property coverage limits. Even if you have limited personal belongings, furnishing a house could quickly reach $100,000 or more.
