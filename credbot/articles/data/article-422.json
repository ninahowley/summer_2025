Unusual fatigue, sudden shortness of breath, any chest discomfort, new sleep disturbances, and abnormal indigestion can all be early indicators of a heart attack. By knowing what symptoms to look for, you can identify early signs of a heart attack when they appear and seek medical attention proactively, potentially reducing the heart attack\u2019s severity or preventing it entirely. **Potential Warning Signs of a Heart Attack a Month Before It Happens** [1] Heart attacks don\u2019t always strike suddenly and violently out of nowhere. In fact, the earliestsigns of a heart attackcan present weeks before the heart attack itself, giving you time to seek medical attention if you notice them. \u201cEven one of these symptoms can be enough to visit the emergency department if it\u2019s new or different from something you\u2019ve experienced before,\u201d saysNisha Parikh, MD, MPH, a cardiologist at Northwell Health in Hyde Park, New York. Dr. Parikh stresses that while many of these symptoms may not seem worthy of an emergency on their own, the suddenness of these symptoms during ordinary tasks is what makes them alarming. **1. Fatigue** Significant changes in your energy and tolerance for physical activity can be an indication of an impending heart attack. \u201cIt\u2019s different from regular tiredness because it\u2019s the kind of fatigue or exhaustion that feels out of proportion to the amount of work you\u2019re doing,\u201d says Parikh. \u201cIf you\u2019re exercising and you feel significantly more tired than usual, don\u2019t ignore this glaring symptom.\u201d While the overall cause of this fatigue is decreased blood flow to the heart, experts say this precursor symptom is more common in women than men. \u201cThere are many gender-based differences in the structure of the heart,\u201d saysSkyler St. Pierre, a Stanford University doctoral candidate who researches the mechanics of biological tissue in the Living Matter Lab in California. [2] **2. Shortness of Breath** Shortness of breath is a common early sign of a heart attack, occurring as a result of the heart not pumping blood properly. Eventually, this dysfunction can cause fluid to build up in the lungs. \u201cIt can also be due to reduced blood flow to the lungs,\u201d says Parikh. \u201cMany of my patients have experienced this symptom in the middle of the night, and it wakes them up.\u201d [3] **3. Chest Discomfort** This classic symptom of a heart attack can differ dramatically based on your gender. While portrayed in movies as a significant and sudden pain in the chest, Parikh says it\u2019s not always so obvious. \u201cThe pain can be mild to severe, and many people describe it as an anxious or nervous feeling in their chest,\u201d she says. \u201cSymptoms of an anxiety attack can mimic this same symptom of heart attack.\u201d Even if yourchest discomfortisn\u2019t persistent, you shouldn\u2019t dismiss it. [4] **4. Sleep Disturbances** The relationship between sleep and heart attacks is complicated. First,insomniaand overall poor sleep quality are significant risk factors for a heart attack because of the stress they place on heart health. Experts also say early symptoms and actual heart attacks most commonly occur at night. \u201cMany heart attacks actually occur at 3 a.m. because that\u2019s when adrenaline and cortisol levels surge,\u201d says Parikh. \u201cMore often than not, we see heart attacks occurring at this time of day.\u201d [5] **5. Indigestion, Nausea, or Stomach Pain** [6] \u201cOftentimes, that digestive discomfort happens because the bottom of the heart isn\u2019t getting as much blood flow [as it should]. That part of your heart sits on the diaphragm and the stomach. That lack of blood flow can lead to nausea.\u201d Parikh says diarrhea and general changes in bowel movements can be an early indicator of a heart attack as well. \u201cAny abnormal nausea during your routine exercise habits can also be a big sign of an impending heart attack,\u201d says Parikh. **6. Dizziness or Lightheadedness** \u201cDizziness can be related to reduced blood flow to the brain,\u201d says Parikh. \u201cWe underestimate how hard the heart works to pump blood throughout the body, including the brain.\u201d [7] \u201cWomen are more likely [than men] to experience this lightheadedness, and even fainting,\u201d says Parikh. **7. Pain in Other Areas** [8] While intense chest pain is usually the heart attack event itself, pain or discomfort in other areas of the upper body are more likely to present in the weeks preceding a heart attack and potentially during the heart attack itself, says Parikh. **When to See a Doctor** On their own, these early signs of a heart attack could be easily dismissed, but experts urge you to acknowledge when they arise suddenly and respond accordingly. \u201cDon\u2019t wait for the classic symptom of chest pain,\u201d says Parikh. \u201cIn real life, heart attack symptoms are more varied. And you shouldn\u2019t wait until you\u2019re experiencing multiple symptoms. If you\u2019re experiencing even one of these symptoms and it\u2019s new or different from what you\u2019ve experienced before, you should take it seriously.\u201d Parikh and St. Pierre both recommend learning about yourpersonal risk factorsfor heart attack and heart disease in order to better evaluate potential early signs. Key factors include: Afamily historyof heart disease and heart attack Smoking more than one cigarette per day Havingprediabetes or diabetes Havinghigh LDL cholesterol Having high triglycerides Havinghigh blood pressure Being a man and over 50 years old Being a woman and over 60 years old Women should be especially vigilant aboutsubtle symptoms, because women are less likely to experience intense chest pain and are also less likely to be promptly and accurately diagnosed with a heart attack. [9] \u201cSeveral studies have shown that women are less likely to be diagnosed during a routine exam, even when they\u2019re experiencing more severe symptoms than men,\u201d says St. Pierre. \u201cWe are under-diagnosing women, and the existing screening methods aren\u2019t catching the early signs of heart attack risk in women.\u201d **The Takeaway** Symptoms of a heart attack can appear weeks ahead of the cardiac event itself. Early warning signs include symptoms like fatigue, shortness of breath, chest discomfort, sleep disturbances, indigestion, dizziness, and pain in areas other than your chest like your jaw or back. Women tend to experience less traditional symptoms of a heart attack than men, including nausea, indigestion, and pain in areas other than the chest. Should any of these symptoms arise suddenly, even if you\u2019re only experiencing one of them, reach out to your healthcare provider for further evaluation. **Resources We Trust** Cleveland Clinic:How to Tell the Difference Between a Heart Attack and a Panic Attack Mayo Clinic:Heartburn or Heart Attack: When to Worry Johns Hopkins Medicine:A Woman\u2019s Guide to Preventing Heart Disease American Heart Association:Lifestyle Changes to Prevent a Heart Attack Centers for Disease Control and Prevention:Preventing Heart Disease Heart Attack.Mayo Clinic.
