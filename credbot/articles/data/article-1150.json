Nash Weerasekera forQuanta Magazine **Introduction** Contributing Correspondent Contributing Correspondent May 22, 2025 The simplest ideas in mathematics can also be the most perplexing. Take addition. It\u2019s a straightforward operation: One of the first mathematical truths we learn is that 1 plus 1 equals 2. But mathematicians still have many unanswered questions about the kinds of patterns that addition can give rise to. \u201cThis is one of the most basic things you can do,\u201d saidBenjamin Bedert, a graduate student at the University of Oxford. \u201cSomehow, it\u2019s still very mysterious in a lot of ways.\u201d In probing this mystery, mathematicians also hope to understand the limits of addition\u2019s power. Since the early 20th century, they\u2019ve been studying the nature of \u201csum-free\u201d sets \u2014 sets of numbers in which no two numbers in the set will add to a third. For instance, add any two odd numbers and you\u2019ll get an even number. The set of odd numbers is therefore sum-free. In a 1965 paper, the prolific mathematician Paul Erd\u0151s asked a simple question about how common sum-free sets are. But for decades, progress on the problem was negligible. \u201cIt\u2019s a very basic-sounding thing that we had shockingly little understanding of,\u201d saidJulian Sahasrabudhe, a mathematician at the University of Cambridge. Until this February. Sixty years after Erd\u0151s posed his problem, Bedert solved it. He showed that in any set composed of integers \u2014 the positive and negative counting numbers \u2014 there\u2019sa large subset of numbers that must be sum-free. His proof reaches into the depths of mathematics, honing techniques from disparate fields to uncover hidden structure not just in sum-free sets, but in all sorts of other settings. \u201cIt\u2019s a fantastic achievement,\u201d Sahasrabudhe said. **Stuck in the Middle** Erd\u0151s knew that any set of integers must contain a smaller, sum-free subset. Consider the set {1, 2, 3}, which is not sum-free. It contains five different sum-free subsets, such as {1} and {2, 3}. Erd\u0151s wanted to know just how far this phenomenon extends. If you have a set with a million integers, how big is its biggest sum-free subset? In many cases, it\u2019s huge. If you choose a million integers at random, around half of them will be odd, giving you a sum-free subset with about 500,000 elements. Paul Erd\u0151s was famous for his ability to come up with deep conjectures that continue to guide mathematics research today. George Csicsery In his 1965 paper, Erd\u0151s showed \u2014 in a proof that was just a few lines long, and hailed as brilliant by other mathematicians \u2014 that any set ofNintegers has a sum-free subset of at leastN/3 elements. Still, he wasn\u2019t satisfied. His proof dealt with averages: He found a collection of sum-free subsets and calculated that their average size wasN/3. But in such a collection, the biggest subsets are typically thought to be much larger than the average. Erd\u0151s wanted to measure the size of those extra-large sum-free subsets. Mathematicians soon hypothesized that as your set gets bigger, the biggest sum-free subsets will get much larger thanN/3. In fact, the deviation will grow infinitely large. This prediction \u2014 that the size of the biggest sum-free subset isN/3 plus some deviation that grows to infinity withN\u2014 is now known as the sum-free sets conjecture. \u201cIt is surprising that this simple question seems to present considerable difficulties,\u201d Erd\u0151s wrote in his original paper, \u201cbut perhaps we overlook the obvious.\u201d For decades, nothing obvious revealed itself. No one could improve on Erd\u0151s\u2019 proof. \u201cThe longer it went without people being able to improve on that simple bound, the more cachet this problem acquired,\u201d saidBen Green, Bedert\u2019s doctoral adviser at Oxford. And, he added, this was precisely the kind of problem where \u201cit\u2019s very, very hard to do any better at all.\u201d **Confronting the Norm** After 25 years without improving on Erd\u0151s\u2019 original result, mathematicians finally began inching forward. In 1990, two researchers proved that any set ofNintegershas a sum-free subsetwith at leastN/3 + 1/3 elements, more commonly written as (N+ 1)/3. But since the size of a set is always a whole number, an increase of 1/3 is often inconsequential. For example, if you know that a sum-free subset has to have at least 5/3 elements, that means its size is guaranteed to be 2 or more. If you add 1/3 to 5/3, your answer is still 2. \u201cIt\u2019s funny, it means that it doesn\u2019t actually always improve it,\u201d saidDavid Conlonof the California Institute of Technology. \u201cIt\u2019s only whenNis divisible by 3 that it improves it.\u201d In 1997, the mathematical legend Jean Bourgain nudged the bound up to (N+ 2)/3. The result might have seemed hardly worth mentioning, but buried in Bourgain\u2019s paper was a startling breakthrough. He described an idea for how to prove that the biggest sum-free subsets would be arbitrarily bigger than that. He just couldn\u2019t pin down the details to turn it into a full proof. \u201cThe paper\u2019s almost like, here\u2019s how I tried to solve the problem and why it didn\u2019t work,\u201d Sahasrabudhe said. Jean Bourgain devised a creative strategy for proving the sum-free sets conjecture. George M. Bergman, Berkeley Bourgain relied on a quantity called the Littlewood norm, which measures a given set\u2019s structure. This quantity, which comes from a field of mathematics called Fourier analysis, tends to be large if a set is more random, and small if the set exhibits more structure. Bourgain showed that if a set withNelements has a large Littlewood norm, then it must also have a sum-free set that\u2019s much larger thanN/3. But he couldn\u2019t make progress in the case where the set has a small Littlewood norm. \u201cBourgain is famously competent,\u201d saidSean Eberhardof the University of Warwick. \u201cIt\u2019s a very striking marker of how difficult this problem is.\u201d Bourgain ultimately had to use a different argument to get his bound of (N+ 2)/3. But mathematicians read between the lines: They might be able to use the Littlewood norm to completely settle the conjecture. They just had to figure out how to deal with sets with a small Littlewood norm. There was reason to be optimistic: Mathematicians already knew of sets with a small Littlewood norm that have massive sum-free subsets. These sets, called arithmetic progressions, consist of evenly spaced numbers, such as {5, 10, 15, 20}. Mathematicians suspected that any set with a small Littlewood norm has a very specific structure \u2014 that it\u2019s more or less a collection of many different arithmetic progressions (with a few tweaks). They hoped that if they could show this, they\u2019d be able to use that property to prove that any set with a small Littlewood norm has a large sum-free subset. But this task wasn\u2019t easy. \u201cI certainly tried to prove the sum-free conjecture using [Bourgain\u2019s] ideas,\u201d Green said, but \u201cwe still don\u2019t understand much about the structure of sets with small Littlewood norm. Everything to do with Littlewood is difficult.\u201d And so, though mathematicians continued to have faith in Bourgain\u2019s Littlewood-based strategy, nothing happened. More than two decades passed. Then, in the fall of 2021, Benjamin Bedert started graduate school. **Notorious Problems** With Green as his doctoral adviser, it was inevitable that Bedert would come across the sum-free sets conjecture. Green\u2019s website lists100 open problems; this one appears first. Bedert perused the list shortly after he began his graduate studies. At first, he shied away from the sum-free sets problem. \u201cI was like, this is super difficult, I\u2019m not going to think about this,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI\u2019ll leave this for the future.\u201d The future arrived soon enough. In summer 2024, Bedert decided he was ready for a riskier project. \u201cI\u2019d proved some reasonably good results in my Ph.D. so far, and kind of put a thesis together already,\u201d he said. \u201cI started thinking about these more, I guess, notorious problems.\u201d Get Quanta Magazine delivered to your inbox Benjamin Bedert, a graduate student at the University of Oxford, has resolved a decades-old problem that tests the role of addition in sets. Romana Meereis He read Bourgain\u2019s 1997 paper and began to muse about how to implement the Littlewood blueprint. Almost immediately, he had an idea for how he might approach the problem of sets with a small Littlewood norm. So far, it had been too difficult to show that sets with a small Littlewood norm always resemble collections of arithmetic progressions. But Bedert thought it might be useful to prove something more attainable: that even if these sets aren\u2019t literally built from arithmetic progressions, they share certain key, progression-like properties. In a recent project, Bedert had come across what he saw as a good candidate for a property to focus on. In arithmetic progressions, there are many groups of numbers that have the same sum. For instance, in the set of even numbers (which is an arithmetic progression), 4 + 8 has the same sum as both 2 + 10 and 2 + 4 + 6. Bedert thought it might be enough to show that sets with a small Littlewood norm always obey this property. Within a couple of weeks, he\u2019d succeeded in proving that the property was true. But would the result give him the level of similarity to arithmetic progressions that he needed to prove the sum-free sets conjecture? \u201cI was definitely excited,\u201d he said. \u201cThen I realized there was still so much more work to do.\u201d **Waves of Progress** First, Bedert showed that any set with a small Littlewood norm could be \u201cmapped\u201d to a second set that bore an even closer resemblance to arithmetic progressions. He suspected that it was in these new sets that he would find large sum-free subsets. The final task was to actually show what the size of such a sum-free subset would be. \u201cOver the Christmas break, I was obsessively thinking about this problem,\u201d Bedert said. \u201cBy New Year\u2019s, I still hadn\u2019t found the final piece of the puzzle.\u201d Then, a few days after he returned to Oxford in January, it came to him. \u201cI\u2019m not sure where it came from,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe these ideas stir in your mind for a while, and then [you] finally get something out that works.\u201d He represented the structure of his sets using a tool called the Fourier transform, and then modifieda 1981 proofto show that some of the individual components of that representation must have a large Littlewood norm. Since Bourgain had already shown how to handle sets with large Littlewood norms, that completed the proof. In the end, Bedert showed that any set ofNintegers has a sum-free subset with at leastN/3 + log(logN) elements. For many values ofN, this gives you a sum-free subset that\u2019s only slightly bigger than Erd\u0151s\u2019 average size ofN/3. Even ifNis as large as 10100, for example, log(logN) is only around 5. But asNinches toward infinity, so does the difference in Bedert\u2019s and Erd\u0151s\u2019 bounds \u2014 thus settling the conjecture. **Related:** Grad Students Find Inevitable Patterns in Big Sets of Numbers **Grad Students Find Inevitable Patterns in Big Sets of Numbers** **Grad Students Find Inevitable Patterns in Big Sets of Numbers** \u2018A-Team\u2019 of Math Proves a Critical Link Between Addition and Sets **\u2018A-Team\u2019 of Math Proves a Critical Link Between Addition and Sets** **\u2018A-Team\u2019 of Math Proves a Critical Link Between Addition and Sets** Big Advance on Simple-Sounding Math Problem Was a Century in the Making **Big Advance on Simple-Sounding Math Problem Was a Century in the Making** **Big Advance on Simple-Sounding Math Problem Was a Century in the Making** \u201cIt\u2019s a really amazing result,\u201d saidYifan Jingof Ohio State University. Jing, who was also mentored by Green, credits the achievement to Bedert\u2019s intense focus. \u201cBenjamin really went in depth to modify Bourgain\u2019s proof and make it work,\u201d he said. \u201cHe spends much more time than other people on the same problem.\u201d There\u2019s still more to understand about sum-free subsets \u2014 and therefore about the extent to which addition influences the structure of the integers. For instance, Bedert\u2019s result resolves the question of whether the largest sum-free subset gets infinitely bigger thanN/3. But mathematicians don\u2019t know precisely how fast that deviation can grow. Thanks toa 2014 paperby Green and two colleagues, they know that the deviation is slower-growing thanN. But, Green said, \u201cthere remains a massive gap\u201d between that upper bound ofNand Bedert\u2019s lower bound of log(logN). The work also provides new insight into sets that have a small Littlewood norm. Such sets are fundamental objects in the field of analysis but are very difficult to study. Bedert\u2019s result has helped mathematicians better understand their structure, which Green and others now hope to continue to explore. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful, it\u2019s interesting, it feels natural,\u201d Eberhard said. \u201cYou want to solve a mystery, don\u2019t you?\u201d For Sahasrabudhe, the takeaway is simple. \u201cOld and difficult problem solved by brilliant kid,\u201d he said. \u201cThe stuff he\u2019s building on, it\u2019s subtle and hard to work with. It\u2019s a really pretty result.\u201d Contributing Correspondent Contributing Correspondent May 22, 2025 Get Quanta Magazine delivered to your inbox Get highlights of the most important news delivered to your email inbox **Also inMathematics** **Epic Effort to Ground Physics in Math Opens Up the Secrets of Time** **Epic Effort to Ground Physics in Math Opens Up the Secrets of Time** **The Core of Fermat\u2019s Last Theorem Just Got Superpowered** **The Core of Fermat\u2019s Last Theorem Just Got Superpowered** **New \u2018Superdiffusion\u2019 Proof Probes the Mysterious Math of Turbulence** **New \u2018Superdiffusion\u2019 Proof Probes the Mysterious Math of Turbulence** **Comment on this article** Quanta Magazine moderates comments to facilitate an informed, substantive, civil conversation.
