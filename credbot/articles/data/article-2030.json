The Chancellor Rachel Reeves stood at the dispatch box this afternoon and signalled that she was rejecting Tory austerity in her first spending review. Many of her announcements, from the 3% extra funding per year for day-to-day NHS spending and \u00a34.5 billion more per year for schools, to \u00a339 billion for social and affordable housing over the next 10 years, will be welcomed by the public. However, looming over Labour\u2019s head is a growing backlash over their plans to cut disability benefits (with a crunch vote next week) and its refusal to axe the two-child benefit cap. Many are warning that Labour still needs to fully break away from austerity. What\u2019s been the response to the Spending Review so far? Labour announced \u00a3190 billion more for day to day spending on public services. Responding to Reeves\u2019 announcement, TUC General Secretary Paul Nowak said: \u201cAfter over a decade of Conservative chaos, rebuilding and repairing Britain was never going to be easy \u2013 but this Government is on the right track. \u201cThe much-needed cash injection into the NHS and schools will be vital to help fix our public services after years of Conservative austerity, and an important boost for the workforce.\u201d Unison\u2019s general secretary Christina McAnea said: \u201cThe chancellor is trying to turn the page on the austerity disaster inflicted on communities across the UK by successive Conservative governments. \u201cMinisters know investing in key public services is the best way to undo the damage of the past and grow the economy of the future.\u201d However, McAnea said: \u201cThe government could make it easier on itself by shifting the dial on taxation. Bringing in a wealth tax would generate extra money that could help fix broken Britain.\u201d Despite the funding boost for the NHS, she said: \u201cThe reality on the ground now is very different. Health trusts across England are making damaging cuts to jobs and services under ministers\u2019 orders to balance this year\u2019s budgets.\u201d On the additional funding for affordable housing, Paul Kissack, Chief Executive of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation said: \u201cThe lack of genuinely affordable homes has had huge implications for poverty, for our economy and for living standards.\u201d He added that \u201cthere\u2019s no fixing that overnight but freeing up funds to invest in such a significant 10-year settlement for a new Affordable Homes Programme will be key to meeting the government\u2019s housing targets and ensuring more people have a decent place to live.\u201d However, Kissack warned that to address poverty, the government must also reverse its planned disability benefit cuts. He warned that the cuts could push 300,000 to 400,000 people into poverty, including 50,000 children. As Labour outlined in its manifesto, Reeves committed to ending the use of asylum hotels by the end of the Parliament, which she said would save the taxpayer \u00a31 billion a year. She announced \u00a3280 million in additional funding for the Border Security Command, which she said will help cut the asylum backlog, hear more appeal cases, and return people who have no right to be here. Enver Solomon, CEO of the Refugee Council, said: \u201cAsylum hotels have become a flashpoint for community tensions and cost billions to the taxpayer, so ending their use is good for refugees, the taxpayer and communities.\u201d However, he said that the deadline of 2029 is \u201cfar away\u201d and urged the government to end the use of asylum hotels before then. Solomon added: \u201cWe need to see the men, women and children who arrive in Britain in search of safety being housed within our communities, not isolated in remote hotels.\u201d While Labour has expanded free school meals to 500,000 more children, charities are warning that to lift children out of poverty, the two-child benefit cap must also be scrapped. Chief executive of Child Poverty Action Group, Alison Garnham, said: The Chancellor described austerity as destructive but the government is still rolling it out in the two-child limit which pulls 109 children into poverty every day. \u201cStruggling families won\u2019t feel any renewal until the two-child limit \u2013the biggest driver of rising child poverty \u2013 is scrapped and that must happen in the Autumn budget. National renewal doesn\u2019t start with record child poverty.\u201d General secretary of the Fire Brigades Union, Steve Wright stressed that \u201cLabour must break with austerity\u201d and, like Unison and the TUC, called for the government to introduce a wealth tax. Wright said: \u201cRachel Reeves and Keir Starmer need to start acting like the Chancellor and Prime Minister, in a real Labour government that taxes the wealthy to fund these priorities for the working class.\u201d Wright welcomed Labour\u2019s U-turn on cutting the winter fuel allowance, but warned that planned welfare cuts risk plunging tens of thousands of people into abject poverty and driving up food bank use. He concluded: \u201cIt\u2019s time to permanently move on from austerity with a wealth tax to fund public services, the welfare state and pay.\u201d Olivia Barber is a reporter at Left Foot Forward Left Foot Forward doesn't have the backing of big business or billionaires.
