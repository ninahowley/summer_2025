The striker has been a key figure for the Red Dragons since joining in July 2021, scoring 110 goals in 172 appearances across all competitions. The 30-year-old has also enjoyed a huge boost to his profile during his time with the club owned by Hollywood actorsRyan ReynoldsandRob McElhenney. Mullin regularly features in theWelcome to Wrexhamdocuseries, and he waseven given a cameo by Reynoldsin last year's Deadpool & Wolverine movie. However, the Liverpudlian struggled for form in the first half ofWrexham's recent League One campaign after undergoing back surgery last summer. He wasleft out of the matchday squadentirely in the league after January as boss Phil Parkinsonsigned strikers Sam Smith and Jay Rodriguezto improve his frontline. The decision to freeze him out led torumours of a bust-upbetween the player and the manager. While Mullinmoved to quash the speculation, describing it on social media as \"absolute nonsense\", he has strongly been linked witha move to Wigan Athleticduring the summer transfer window. Mullin's place in the team looks increasingly doubtful after the North Wales side gainedpromotion to the Championshipin April. But former Wrexham andSwanseastrikerLee Trundlehas now backed him to regain his spot after praising his impressive scoring record in previous seasons. Speaking on theFearless in Devotionpodcast, he said: \"If you take the goals that Mulls scores and the amount that he scores, you don't just lose that overnight. He had injuries at the start of the season which kept him out. Welcome to Wrexham is back on Disney+ for a fourth season. Fans can watch the series with a\u00a34.99 monthly plan, or get12 months for the price of 10by paying for a year upfront. \"When you're used to scoring that many goals each season, as soon as you go through that little bad patch, it does affect you as a striker, and it would affect him. He's been the talisman for the team and he's been the one who\u2019s scored all the goals. \"Let's be fair, he's been one of the main reasons for Wrexham's success. He did hit that bad patch, but I do think that he could come back next season, because he's got it in him. I do think that he's a quality player.\" Reports of Wigan's alleged interest in Mullin first emerged in April, when it was claimed Wrexham could be willing to allow him to leave without a transfer fee to smooth his exit. His current contract at the Racecourse Ground runs until the summer of 2027, but letting him go could free up money due to his substantial wage packet. Despite the rumours, Parkinson has insisted that both Mullin and his strike partner Ollie Palmer still have a place at Wrexham. **Sign up to our newsletter!
