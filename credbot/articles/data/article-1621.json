As Attorney General Pam Bondi announced the unsealing of a grand jury indictment, an acting assistant attorney general filed a motion in federal court in Maryland, saying the U.S. had \u201ccomplied with the Court\u2019s order, and indeed have successfully facilitated Abrego Garcia\u2019s return.\u201d In addition, Yaakov Roth, said Abrego Garcia\u2019s suit against the government \u201cshould be dismissed as moot.\u201d However, in a motion filed Sunday in federal court in Greenbelt, Maryland, Abrego Garcia\u2019s attorney Andrew Rossman wrote the idea that the Trump administration complied with the court\u2019s order \u201cis pure farce.\u201d Abrego Garcialived in the U.S.for roughly 14 years, during which he worked construction, got married and was raising three children with disabilities, according to court records. Trump administration officials said he was deported based on a 2019 accusation from Maryland police that he was an MS-13 gang member. Abrego Garcia denied the allegation and was never charged with a crime, his attorneys said. In the newly-filed motion, Abrego Garcia\u2019s lawyers said the federal government has \u201cengaged in an elaborate, all of government effort to defy court orders, deny due process, and disparage Abrego Garcia.\u201d His attorneys said the federal government only began developing the human trafficking case against Abrego Garcia under threat of sanctions. And the decision to return him to Tennessee, rather than Maryland didn\u2019t comply with the U.S. Supreme Court directive to \u201censure that his case is handled as it would have been had he not been improperly sent to El Salvador.\u201d Even with Abrego Garcia in Tennessee, and facing criminal charges, his lawyers said the Maryland court is still in a position to impose sanctions, and the plaintiffs \u201care entitled to examine in discovery whether Government officials acted in good faith.\u201d As of Monday morning, the federal government had not filed a response to Abrego Garcia\u2019s objection to its request to dismiss the suit.
