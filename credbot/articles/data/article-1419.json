In a marketing campaign that has come to define the 1980s, Pepsi introduced a taste test called thePepsi Challengein 1975. This got Americans to focus on and acknowledge that Pepsi has a distinctly sweeter taste than Coca-Cola \u2013 a taste that Americans preferred back then; itssales jumpedin stores nationwide,surpassingCoca-Cola sales. To regain its market share, Coca-Cola tried to literally sweeten the competition, transforming its product intoNew Coke. While this sweeter version failed, it made the company return to its roots, rebranding itself as Coca-Cola Classic and pushing its popular Diet Coke, to great success. While PepsiCo ranks higher than Coca-Cola inForbes Leading Global Brandsin 2024, Coca-Cola is the leadingcarbonated soft drink companyin the US. In long-term branding and growth Amid growing nationwide awareness of wellness and nutrition, including the government\u2019s attempts at passing a soda tax, Americans aredrinking less sodathan ever before. This trend may grow now, given theWHO\u2018s findings that aspartame, found in Diet Coke, may be a carcinogen. Long before the WHO\u2019s announcement, both Pepsi and Coca-Cola had been embarking on different paths to remain relevant and competitive in the long term. Coca-Cola has been transitioning into a \u201ctotal beverage company,\u201d partnering over the last few years with various brands of bottled waters,teas, premium milk and evencanned alcoholic drinksin Japan. In 2023, the company introduced mixed cans ofJack Daniels & Coca-Colain the US. Meanwhile, Pepsi has jumped on the nutrition bandwagon,ditching aspartamefrom its diet beverages back in 2015 (before reintroducing it in 2016) and later expanding its portfolio of snack foods to include \u201cguilt-free products\u201d that focus onnutrition and healthy ingredients, like grains, fruits, vegetables or protein as well ashealthy drinks. In target audience and marketing Over the decades, Pepsi and Coca-Cola have targeted different consumer demographics. Pepsi has historically succeeded in targeting younger consumers. (This is despite Pepsi\u2019s 2017 advertisement fiasco withKendall Jennerattempting but failing to engage Millennials by promoting social responsibility.) Pepsi introduced \u201cthe Pepsi Generation\u201d in the 1960s, marketing itself to the younger, hipper, more daring teen and pre-teen segment, relying oncelebritiesto show how youthful and energizing the beverage is. (It also appealed to younger consumers by being cheaper than its rival.) In contrast, Coca-Cola has always represented itself asclassic Americana, endearing itself to older, more traditional consumers, playing to their emotions, and promoting a reliable drink that goes well with any kind of food or company. Its most memorable embodiment of comradery, unity and diversity was Coca-Cola\u2019s iconic 1970s advertisement that showed people singing aboutharmony on a hilltop. Fast forward through the decades, and its2014 Super Bowl commercialagain promoted diversity. **** **There Are No Differences between Pepsi and Coca-Cola** Both created by pharmacists Both Pepsi and Coca-Cola were created bypharmacists. Coca-Cola inventorJohn Stith Pembertonhad been a chemist and druggist before serving in the Civil War. Pain from war injuries led to a morphine addiction, which was later replaced by cocaine, which inspired Pemberton to concoct a beverage containing coca leaves and kola nuts, called French Wine Cola. In 1886, he replaced the wine with sugar syrup, and, voila, Coca-Cola.Cocainewas removed from the formula in 1929. As for Pepsi,Caleb Bradhamwas a part-time pharmacist while in medical school. After dropping out and becoming a full-time pharmacist, he developed Pepsi in 1893 in his own drug store. Known back then as Brad\u2019s Drink, it contained water, sugar, caramel, nutmeg, and lemon oil, among other natural additives, and was sold as an energy booster and digestive aid. Despite this marketing gimmick and its1898 trademarked name Pepsi, the enzyme, pepsin, which helps digest the proteins in food, was never an ingredient in Pepsi. Imprinted on the brain The makers of both Pepsi and Coca-Cola have succeeded in convincing us that their brand names are more influential than their actual flavors.Researchshows that our brains apparently have little taste preference between Coca-Cola and Pepsi \u2013 but prefer both name brands over a generic brand of cola.Brain scansof study participants revealed that compared to generic cola brands, those who thought they were trying Pepsi or Coca-Cola, had more neural activity in theleft ventral striatum, which is the part of the brain that is activated when reward is received or expected. This effect was found even though all the samples consisted of the same beverage. Surrounded by the same controversy The companies behind Pepsi and Coca-Cola have been surrounded by the same controversy regardingreported attemptsto undermine the health of American consumers. From 2011 to 2015, they both gave millions of dollars to 96 national health organizations to develop relationships that would have positive associations for their brands. However, at the same time, they both spent millions more lobbying against legislative efforts to combat obesity in America, according to astudy by Boston University researchersthat was published in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine. During the five-year study, the companies reportedlylobbied againstat least 28 public health bills aimed at reducing soda consumption. The Bottom Line: Despite having distinct differences in flavor, target audience and branding ventures, both Pepsi and Coca-Cola have similar histories, consumer sway and power to influence societal norms.
