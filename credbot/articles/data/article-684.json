Scottish Woodlands, which is 80% owned by its employees, also revealed operating profits of \u00a34.54m, down slightly from \u00a34.61m year-on-year, with net assets increasing from \u00a322.81m to \u00a325.96m. Since the period covered by the results, parent company SWL has further expanded, with the acquisition of Crieff-based RTS Forestry. The combined group now has more than 300 employees and operates across all of Scotland, as well as in the north of England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Scottish Woodlands has 20 offices, in all four parts of the UK, and is headquartered at Riccarton, Edinburgh. It planted more than 3,000 hectares of new woodland in Scotland alone in 2023/24 - the most the company has planted in a year since the 1980s. A statement explained: \u201cThe UK remains in a housing crisis and with the welcome and ambitious new housebuilding targets and planning reforms set by the new government, should create the stimulus to boost the construction sector and therefore timber demand in 2025.\u201d The commentary also noted the need for the UK to grow more of the timber it consumes. \u201cInvestment in the UK sawmilling industry continues and, with the UK back as the second largest net importer of timber in the world after China, this underlines the long-term need and demand for domestically produced softwood. \u201cThe company is well-placed to not only meet the requirements of improving markets and increasing demand, but also in delivering productive forests, something which is greatly needed to reduce the UK reliance on imported timber.\u201d Ian Robinson, managing director of Scottish Woodlands, commented: \u201cThis is a strong set of results, demonstrating our continued ability to adapt to ever-changing and challenging market conditions. \u201cScottish Woodlands continues to be an industry leader in woodland creation and management, and in developing our workforce and using the latest equipment and technology. \u201cOur carbon team is thriving, with an increasing focus on peatland restoration - and our utilities division, providing forestry services for utility and rail companies, remains a very strong part of the business.\u201d He added: \u201cThe acquisition of RTS Forestry in December 2024 signals our desire for further growth, but above all else, our commitment to the continued provision of high-quality services to all our clients across the UK.\u201d The company is also committed to growing its own future leaders and recruits an average of six young people per year onto its graduate programme. The new recruits this year will take the total number to more than 70 since the programme was launched in 2017. Don't miss the latest headlines with our twice-daily newsletter -sign up here for free.
