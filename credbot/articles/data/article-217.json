Here are four possibilities** **What made Comcast, the dominant TV provider in the area, agree to end its blackout of CHSN after more than eight months? It certainly wasn\u2019t the teams\u2019 play.** SHARE COPY LINK Share Twitter Facebook Email Reddit Flipboard Our long regional nightmare is over. Chicago Sports Network isexpected to launch on Comcast cable Friday, likely in time for the Royals-White Sox game, the Sun-Times has learned. That will allow about 1 million Xfinity customers in the area to watch the rest of the Sox\u2019 season and not miss another entire Bulls and Blackhawks season. After fighting to launch on the Popular programming tier, Comcast\u2019s middle tier of channels, CHSN will appear on the Ultimate tier, which costs an additional $20 per month. Customers had been receiving a monthly credit of $8.85 to offset the loss of NBC Sports Chicago, the teams\u2019 former home, which went off the air Sept. 30. So what made Comcast, the dominant TV provider in the area, agree to end its blackout of CHSN after more than eight months? It certainly wasn\u2019t the teams\u2019 play. They haven\u2019t done the network any favors bylosing as often as they have. That\u2019s no way to create leverage. CHSN knew its path to wide distribution would be bumpy, especially with Comcast, which has been moving regional sports networks across the country to its highest programming tier. Industry insiders speculated on four possible reasons the sides reached an agreement. **CHSN lowered asking price** Programmers charge distributors a monthly fee per subscriber to carry a channel, and the distributor passes the cost to consumers. This reason seems unlikely because CHSN couldn\u2019t have been asking for too much, given the state of RSNs and that of its teams. Such information is normally locked down by non-disclosure agreements. **CHSN agreed to be tiered** CHSN staffers knew that if Comcast was going to carry the network, it would end up on the Ultimate tier. Standard Media, which is partnering with the teams to handle distribution, fought that fate, but to no avail. Though CHSN won\u2019t have the reach it would on a lower tier, it\u2019ll make more ad revenue on Comcast than it does over the air on the WJYS subchannels. Interestingly, the Cubs\u2019 Marquee Sports Network is expected to remain on the Popular tier through the season and move to the Ultimate tier before next season. Marquee essentially has been grandfathered in, and certainly theCubs\u2019 on-field successhas helped. **Comcast lost subscribers** Is it possible that enough Sox fans made enough of a stink to get Comcast\u2019s attention? That information is hard to get, and the company seems to be more focused on bolstering its internet service than appeasing Sox fans anyway. **CHSN agreed to reduce over-the-air access** This would go against part of the network\u2019s business plan, which has been to expand its footprint within the teams\u2019 TV territory to sell advertising. OTA distribution was never meant to replace the distribution CHSN couldn\u2019t achieve. It was more of an act of goodwill with customers until the network met its goals. But Comcast didn\u2019t see it that way, questioning why it should pay for a channel that was free to all. It was the No. 1 sticking point in negotiations, which led some to believe that CHSN agreed to reduce the number of games available over the air to grant Comcast some exclusivity in the market. The answer could be all, none or some of the above. One reason that isn\u2019t behind the detente is NBC\u2019s upcoming deal with the NBA. The theory was that Comcast, which owns NBC, would want to promote games that will air on the network and streaming service Peacock during Bulls games on CHSN. If that were the case, sources said, Comcast would wait until the NBA season to settle the dispute and not pay to carry CHSN for the next four months. Comcast and NBC are not one and the same. Comcast owns NBCUniversal, which owns and operates NBC. CHSN has been dealing with Comcast cable\u2019s programming division, whose goals often don\u2019t align with NBC\u2019s. Whatever the case, the nightmare is over, and the games are about to return. Of course, considering the teams, that opens the possibility of many other nightmares.
