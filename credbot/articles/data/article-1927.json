Home About Featured U.S. News Commentary Politics Contact **Warning from Catholic Archbishop: President Trump Is Preparing to Fight Against the Demonic Deep State and New World Order** Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigan\u00f2, the former apostolic nuncio to the United States, wrote a letter this year for the National Catholic Prayer Breakfast, which was held on Wednesday. Archbishop Vigano warned Catholics on the importance of the 2020 presidential election on the future of the United States and the world. President Donald Trump is standing up against the demonic forces of the deep state and the New World Order, the Archbishop said. (An apostolic nuncio (also known as a papal nuncio or simply as a nuncio) is an ecclesiastical diplomat, serving as an envoy or a permanent diplomatic representative of the Holy See to a state or to an international organization.) The devout cleric views the 2020 presidential election as being the \u201cChildren of Light against the Children of Darkness.\u201d \u201cPresident Trump is the greatest defender of the Supreme Values of the Christian civilization: of life, from conception to natural death; of the natural family composed of one man and one woman and children; and of love for the homeland:One Nation under God!\u201dthe Archbishop noted. The prayer breakfast leaders chose not to read this letter during the breakfast. Here this the letter from Archbishop: I would like to make myself present on this memorable occasion, in which I participated with great enthusiasm as Apostolic Nuncio during the years of my mission in Washington, D.C. (2011-2016). I therefore join all the participants in this extraordinary celebration and all American Catholics, who see in President Donald Trump the greatest defender of the supreme values of Christian civilization: of life, from conception to natural death; of the natural family composed of one man and one woman and children; and of love for the homeland: One Nation under God! And, most importantly, he stands for defending the right to freely practice our Faith, thus allowing us more fully to honor God. The presidential elections in November represent an epochal challenge, a biblical challenge, the outcome of which will be decisive not only for the United States of America but for the whole world. It is necessary that all of you Catholics of America are well aware of the role that Providence has deigned to entrust to your President, and that you are aware of the extraordinary battle that He is preparing to fight against the demonic forces of the deep state and against the New World Order. I am at your side with fervent prayer, together with millions of Catholics and with all people of good will throughout the world. Our trust rests in God, the Almighty, whose right hand always works wonders. Carlo Maria Vigan\u00f2,Titular Archbishop of UlpianaFormer Apostolic Nuncio of Washington, D.C. (2011-2016) In a previous letter to President Donald Trump, Archbishop Vigano wrote: For the first time, the United States has in you a President who courageously defends the right to life, who is not ashamed to denounce the persecution of Christians throughout the world, who speaks of Jesus Christ and the right of citizens to freedom of worship. Your participation in the March for Life, and more recently your proclamation of the month of April as National Child Abuse Prevention Month, are actions that confirm which side you wish to fight on.And I dare to believe that both of us are on the same side in this battle, albeit with different weapons. For this reason, I believe that the attack to which you were subjected after your visit to the National Shrine of Saint John Paul II is part of the orchestrated media narrative which seeks not to fight racism and bring social order, but to aggravate dispositions; not to bring justice, but to legitimize violence and crime; not to serve the truth, but to favor one political faction. And it is disconcerting that there are Bishops \u2013 such as those whom I recently denounced \u2013 who, by their words, prove thatthey are aligned on the opposing side. They are subservient to the deep state, to globalism, to aligned thought, to the New World Orderwhich they invoke ever more frequently in the name of a universal brotherhood which has nothing Christian about it, but which evokes the Masonic ideals of those want to dominate the world by driving God out of the courts, out of schools, out of families, and perhaps even out of churches. The American people are mature and have now understood how much the mainstream media does not want to spread the truth but seeks to silence and distort it, spreading the lie that is useful for the purposes of their masters.However, it is important that the good \u2013 who are the majority \u2013 wake up from their sluggishness and do not accept being deceived by a minority of dishonest people with unavowable purposes. It is necessary that the good, the children of light, come together and make their voices heard. What more effective way is there to do this, Mr. President, than by prayer, asking the Lord to protect you, the United States, and all of humanity from this enormous attack of the Enemy? Before the power of prayer, the deceptions of the children of darkness will collapse, their plots will be revealed, their betrayal will be shown, their frightening power will end in nothing, brought to light and exposed for what it is: an infernal deception. Mr. President, my prayer is constantly turned to the beloved American nation, where I had the privilege and honor of being sent by Pope Benedict XVI as Apostolic Nuncio. In this dramatic and decisive hour for all of humanity, I am praying for you and also for all those who are at your side in the government of the United States. I trust that the American people are united with me and you in prayer to Almighty God. United against the Invisible Enemy of all humanity, I bless you and the First Lady, the beloved American nation, and all men and women of good will. + Carlo Maria Vigan\u00f2 Titular Archbishop of Ulpiana \u2190Biden Family Cashed In On Joe Biden\u2019s Vice Presidency, Says Senate Probe Report Joe Biden\u2019s Habitual Lying: Claims of Attending Black College Proven False\u2192 Jim Kouri, CPP, is founder and CEO of Kouri Associates, a homeland security, public safety and political consulting firm.
