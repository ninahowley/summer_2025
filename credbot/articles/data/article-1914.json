Angela Halili, 29, and Arielle Reitsma, 35\u2014hosts of the rising Christian podcast Girl Gone Bible\u2014are under criticism for appearing in a commercial for the activewear brand Three Nails, with critics calling the clothing too revealing while supporters defend their message and intent, theDaily Mailreported. Halili and Reitsma launched their podcast in 2023 after both left previous careers in Hollywood modeling and acting. Since then, Girl Gone Bible has become one of the world\u2019s most-streamed Christian programs, garnering millions of downloads and views through captivating content on spirituality and lifestyle topics. **Outcry Follows Promotion of Christian Apparel Brand** The controversy erupted when the pair shared a new promotional video for Three Nails, a Christian athleisure brand. Many commenters on social media expressed concern over the form-fitting designs, particularly leggings, stating such outfits could be distracting or immodest from a conservative Christian standpoint. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing modest about this clothing,\u201d one commenter wrote. \u201cThey\u2019re very tight and reveal the curvature of the human body.\u201d Another user warned, \u201cThese men don\u2019t need to see every crack and crevice.\u201d Other followers echoed similar sentiments, questioning the compatibility of tight activewear with biblical modesty. Critics cited that even if labeled Christian, clothing should not automatically be considered spiritually appropriate. **Supporters Praise Messaging and Personal Growth** Despite the backlash, Halili and Reitsma received a wave of encouragement from other fans. Supporters called the clothing \u201crespectful\u201d and \u201ccute,\u201d emphasizing its practicality for gym use and personal journeys toward modesty. \u201cLOVE, so cute,\u201d one fan commented, applauding the absence of low-cut designs. Another wrote, \u201cI\u2019ve struggled with modesty, and this is very tasteful.\u201d Listeners also shared how the podcast had inspired spiritual growth, even among non-Christians. One social media user explained, \u201cI\u2019m not a Christian, but I like hearing your stories and reading scripture, which is weird because I\u2019m far from God.\u201d **Influencers Respond to Comments and Controversy** Halili and Reitsma did not ignore the backlash. Instead, they offered candid reflections on the complexities of modesty in modern Christian life and how physical appearance can distort perception. \u201cI can wear the same outfit as a girl who\u2019s extremely thin with no curves, and just because of my body type, I\u2019ll look promiscuous in it and she won\u2019t,\u201d Halili said, addressing the role of body image in modesty judgment. Reitsma added, \u201cI know some girls who take photos in their crop tops and their bikinis, but they have more compassion in their hearts... they would never write the things that some of these Christians are writing.\u201d **Past Careers Add to Online Scrutiny** The pair\u2019s previous work in entertainment continues to spark debate. Halili once played a provocatively dressed nun in a Marilyn Manson music video, while Reitsma had modeled for men\u2019s magazines like Maxim and appeared in films such as Rock of Ages. In 2023, Halili stated that she was actively reshaping her online content to reflect a more conservative image. Meanwhile, Reitsma has spoken about her evolving perspective on attire, saying, \u201cAs I became more of a woman, I felt more beautiful being more covered up.\u201d Still, some online critics claim their past and current social media presence undermines their Christian witness. Comments include calls to remove certain posts and label them as not honoring God. **Differing Views on Modesty Divide Christian Audience** The debate illustrates a broader divergence within the Christian community over what constitutes modesty. Some argue that faith must align with cultural expectations of conservative dress, while others believe discipleship transcends appearance. \u201cChristianity doesn\u2019t have a \u2018look,\u2019\u201d one fan posted in support. Another wrote, \u201cThank you for using your platform for good and pushing through the tough comments.\u201d Despite the criticism, Halili and Reitsma continue to engage with their audience online, appearing determined to blend spiritual outreach with real-world topics like clothing, fitness, and faith. **NATIONAL NEWS** **SEE ALL** **SEE ALL** **Johnson warns of Democrat-led impeachment push if House flips in 2026** **Johnson warns of Democrat-led impeachment push if House flips in 2026** **Trump\u2019s DOT chief clears Biden\u2019s grant backlog, cuts DEI** **Trump\u2019s DOT chief clears Biden\u2019s grant backlog, cuts DEI** **Jack Ciattarelli secures GOP nod for New Jersey governor race** **Jack Ciattarelli secures GOP nod for New Jersey governor race** **California seeks urgent halt to military in immigration raids** **California seeks urgent halt to military in immigration raids** **Justice Department removes attorney over deportation mishap** **Justice Department removes attorney over deportation mishap** **DON'T WAIT.** **LATEST NEWS** **Don Lemon, Kathy Griffin question 2024 election integrity, hint at tampering** **Don Lemon, Kathy Griffin question 2024 election integrity, hint at tampering** **Prosecutors slam Kohberger's trial delay tactics in Idaho murders case** **Prosecutors slam Kohberger's trial delay tactics in Idaho murders case** **Minnesota lawmaker admits to illegal U.S. entry** **Minnesota lawmaker admits to illegal U.S. entry** **Trump warns Musk of consequences for Democratic support** **Trump warns Musk of consequences for Democratic support** **Johnson warns of Democrat-led impeachment push if House flips in 2026** **Johnson warns of Democrat-led impeachment push if House flips in 2026** **Newsletter** **NEWS** **WEBSITE** Home About Us Contact Us Unsubscribe"}
