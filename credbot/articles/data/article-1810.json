But new research suggests they may be doing more harm than good in the long run. A major study published inRadiologyfound that patients who received corticosteroid injections experiencedworse joint deteriorationthan those who received no treatment or those who got an alternative injection. Researchers followed 210 knee arthritis patients for several years, using detailed MRI scans to track changes in joint health. Those who received steroid injections showed clear signs of accelerated cartilage and bone marrow damage. In contrast, patients who received hyaluronic acid injections \u2014 a gel-like substance that lubricates the joint \u2014 experiencedlessjoint damage over time. Pain relief was observed with both treatments. Cortisone shots reduced pain more dramatically at first, but at the potential cost of joint health. Hyaluronic acid provided more modest pain relief but may help preserve cartilage, offering longer-term benefits. This doesn\u2019t mean cortisone is always a bad choice, especially in cases of severe, acute pain. However, it does require more thoughtful decision-making between patients and doctors. Millions of Americans receive these injections each year, and the findings suggest a need to reevaluate standard practices, particularly for those with mild to moderate arthritis. While the study was observational and couldn\u2019t prove direct causation, the MRI results were consistent and concerning. More research is needed, but for now, this study offers an important reminder: fast relief isn\u2019t always the safest path. For those weighing their options, the message is clear: ask your doctor about the long-term risks and consider alternatives that may be more gentle on your knees.
