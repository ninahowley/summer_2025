Gen Z is going big but not for the right reason. It\u2019s great when you see influencers promoting a healthy lifestyle, training, and eating healthy. But, something else is happening that can influence a younger population in making some bad choices. **Flexing Over Being Healthy** The bad reason why so many young people are training is to flex on social media and boost their following. This isn\u2019t the case for most people, but there\u2019s an expansion of social media influencers and young adults who are using steroids to get a perfect body. This flex culture comes with consequences when supplements are misused. So, the importance of safety in the gym is more important than ever. Reasons why Gen Z loves the gym: Aesthetics over endurance. Social media gym culture. Body positivity and strength culture. Mental health boost. Growing community. **Data about Gym Members** Data backs up the claim that Gen Z is the biggest gym generation so far. One of the claims is that from 2008 to 2018 the number of memberships grew up to 40%. It became accessible for everyone, and it\u2019s never been easier to find a training routine. Everything can be done through your phone instead of having a professional guide you through each exercise. The USA has the most gym goers, around 64 million. The next on the list is Germany, with only 11 million gym members. **How does This Affect Sports?** Some of the sports that weren\u2019t in the spotlight for a while are coming back. Powerlifting was huge, but not comparable to traditional sports like football and basketball. With so many influencers promoting weight lifting, the constant grind to lift more comes with some records being broken. All of the 1000+ pounds squats were made in the last 7 years. Some of them are from older generations, but imagine what the youngsters will do in the upcoming years. **Related** **sports betting calculator** **sports betting calculator** **mlb parlay calculator** **mlb parlay calculator** **moneyline payout calculator** **moneyline payout calculator** **half points in nfl** **half points in nfl** **kelly criterion calculations** **kelly criterion calculations** **how to hedge a bet calculator** **how to hedge a bet calculator** **spread in betting** **spread in betting** **explain over under betting** **explain over under betting** **sportsbook parlays** **sportsbook parlays** **what is round robin betting** **what is round robin betting** **ev sports betting** **ev sports betting** **hedge mean in betting** **hedge mean in betting** **FIFA's CWC Brings Complications, But Could Still Be a Massive Global Hit** **Roman Anthony Shines in Fenway Debut, Red Sox Remain a Work in Progress** **Best NBA Finals Game 3 Bets: Thunder vs. Pacers Picks, Predictions, and Player Props** **MLB Best Bets: June 10th Top Picks, Player Props** **Puck Stops Here: Oilers\u2019 Only Option To Survive in Florida Is Defense** **New York Giants Redshirting Jaxson Dart Is Smart** **Texans Land Nick Chubb, the NFL\u2019s Most Drama-Proof Running Back** **Pete Alonso\u2019s MVP Surge Giving Mets the Season They Let Daniel Murphy Walk For** **Tyrese Haliburton Needs to Wake Up Or These NBA Finals Are Over Early** **MLB Best Bets for June 9th: Top Picks, Player Props and More** NBA Finals Game 2 Picks: Best Bets for Thunder vs. Pacers MLB Best Bets for Saturday, June 7: Top Picks and Totals to Target UFC 316 Best Bets: O\u2019Malley\u2019s Revenge, Harrison\u2019s Statement, and Spivac\u2019s Edge Thursday\u2019s June 5th MLB Best Bets, Top Predictions RBC Canadian Open Best Bets & Props: Rory McIlroy, Canadian Hopefuls, and a Pro Debut NBA Finals 2025 Best Bets: Game 1 Picks, Series Odds, and MVP Value Plays 2025 Stanley Cup Final: Best Bets as Panthers, Oilers Meet Again Sitemap Privacy Terms of Use About Us Copyright2025"}
