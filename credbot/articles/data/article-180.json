Newsom and other officials suggest withholding taxes from the federal government. Welcome to CalMatters, the only nonprofit newsroom devoted solely to covering issues that affect all Californians. Sign up forWhatMattersto receive the latest news and commentary on the most important issues in the Golden State. Gov. Gavin Newsom suggested last week that California may withhold taxes it pays to the United States if President Donald Trump slashes federal funding to the state. It could be another front inthe escalating battlebetween the Trump administration and the Golden State, which are at the moment wrestling over the presidentsummoning the militaryto handleprotests against immigration raidsin Los Angeles. But how it would all work \u2014 on both sides \u2014 is anyone\u2019s guess. CalMatters asked several tax experts to weigh in on how the state could withhold money from the federal government. Most would not comment about what they called a \u201cvague\u201d threat by state officials. But they pointed out that residents and businesses pay state and federal governments directly when they file their income taxes \u2014 making it unclear what tax money California could withhold. Newsom is not suggesting people stop paying their taxes, said Tara Gallegos, a spokesperson for the governor. But she said the state is considering \u201cwhether there are potential options that would allow it to retain some of the funding it typically sends the federal government.\u201d **Read Next** **72 hours in LA: Immigration sweeps, protests and a historic National Guard deployment** She would not provide further details and did not answer CalMatters\u2019 question about which of his staff the governor has directed to explore those options. California\u2019s biggest sources of revenue are personal income tax, corporation tax and sales tax, the last of which goes to local and state governments. The state does not handle other excise taxes, such as those from airports, transportation and more, that the federal government receives, according to the Finance Department. Newsom on Friday also floatedon social mediathe idea that California is a \u201cdonor\u201d state and contributes tens of billions of dollars more a year to the U.S. than it gets back, something Gallegos reiterated to CalMatters.

In fiscal year 2023-24, California\u2019s total federal taxes were $806 billion \u2014 nearly twice as much as Texas, which contributed $417 billion, and more than twice the $384 billion New York contributed. State Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas alsoposted on social medialast week that California must look at \u201cevery option\u201d including withholding tax dollars, saying that \u201cwe\u2019re the nation\u2019s economic engine and the largest donor state, and deserve our fair share.\u201d Rivas, a Salinas Democrat, was not available to answer questions, his staff said. Some people dispute the notion of donor states. \u201cThe governor\u2019s long-standing complaint that California is a donor state rings hollow,\u201d said Jared Walczak, vice president of state projects for the Tax Foundation, a Washington, D.C.-based right-leaning think tank. \u201cUnless California politicians are questioning the legitimacy of Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security, the complaint that California residents pay more in federal taxes than they get back is disingenuous.\u201d \u201cCourts have made it abundantly clear that you can\u2019t be a conscientious objector to paying taxes,\u201d Walczak said. Courts have also made it tough for the White House to cancel funding. White House spokesperson Harrison Fields confirmed in an email to CalMatters this week that the Trump administration is reviewing possible wide-ranging funding cuts to California, as reported last week by different media outlets such asCNNand theWashington Post. But Fields said no decision has been made, and would not specify which programs are being considered for defunding. In the same email, Fields said the answers were on background or off the record, which he and CalMatters did not agree to beforehand. H.D. Palmer, spokesperson for California\u2019s Finance Department, pointed to the Trump administration\u2019s attempt tofreeze hundreds of billions of dollarsin federal grants and loans, through an Office of Management and Budget memo, which it then rescinded in late January after public outcry and court orders. \u201cOne salient point from our high school civics lessons: The power of the purse doesn\u2019t lie with the (presidential) administration,\u201d Palmer said. Palmer provided a list of state programs that receive the most federal funding, which the state is counting on in its current budget. The list includes money for health, education, highway planning and construction, disaster recovery, grants for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and more. The biggest is $100.9 billion for medical assistance programs. He said the White House has yet to provide specifics or answer the following question: \u201cWhat public policy benefit are you seeking by withholding these federal dollars from California?\u201d **Read More on Trump and California** **\u2018An endless game of whack-a-mole\u2019: California tariffs lawsuit thrown out, but it\u2019s not over** **Trump trade war has already had huge effect on California ports** Read more from CalMatters Text Get breaking news on your phone.
