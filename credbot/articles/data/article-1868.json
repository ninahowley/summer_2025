Sure, everyone seems happy in the beginning\u2013 but how many of them settle into lasting happiness? Psychologists John and Julie Gottman have been studying relationship data for nearly 40 years now, and think they\u2019ve got it figured out. They shared their findings in an interview with \u201cBusiness Insider\u201d. **Signs to Look For** The Gottmans say watching a couple\u2019s interactions can reveal how happy or unhappy they are. People make \u2018bids\u2019 for connection. A bid is when a wife might say, \u201cHoney, this is a really good article!\u201d How the spouse reacts to that bid is crucial. He can \u2018turn toward\u2019 this bid by acknowledging it in a positive way, or he can \u2018turn away\u2019 by brushing it off or being unsupportive of it. It\u2019s not about the magazine article, but about how spouses meet each other\u2019s emotional needs. Happily married spouses \u2018turn toward\u2019 each other nearly all of the time, while unhappy spouses or divorced couple \u2018turned away\u2019 most of the time. Contempt, according to the Gottmans, is the nail in the coffin of happiness. People who criticize spouses are \u2018scanning\u2019 their spouse for mistakes frequently, and tend to only see the negative when they get into that habit. **Keys to Happiness** Keys to a happy marriage made me want to clunk my head. It\u2019s so simple it\u2019s mind-boggling. According to the Gottmans, two qualities are prevalent in happy marriages: kindness and generosity. When our spouses treat us with kindness, we feel as though they care about us. When someone is kind to us, the more we want to return that kindness. Generosity is not just giving tangible things to each other, but intangible things: time, the benefit of the doubt, responding to a \u2018bid\u2019. How have these simple ideas \u2014 which everyone from our parents to purple dinosaurs have been trying to drill into our heads since birth \u2014 eluded us in our relationships? It may be time to start re-thinking not just how our partners treat us, but how we treat them.
