Gavin Newsom and the entertainment industry are back to hectoring America from the Golden State. This time it\u2019s about the \u201cmostly peaceful\u201d riots in Los Angeles, but I can\u2019t help but recognize the tone of privileged condescension as the same one in which their party lectures our Israeli allies every time they are besieged by violent mobs. So what would it look like if we took them seriously and applied their own logic to the pickle they\u2019ve got themselves in now?Yesterday, amid the demonstrations and riots in Los Angeles against federal immigration authorities, Newsom gave anemotional speechin which he told Californians the one thing they should never give President Trump: \u201cYour silence.\u201dI agree. After all, as the former astronaut Katy Perryposted, Los Angeles\u2014\u201cEl Pueblo de Nuestra Senora la Reina de Los Angeles de Porciuncula,\u201d as she so artfully calls it\u2014\u201cwas once Mexican land.\u201d So why should the protests stop at all, no matter what ICE does or does not do?Further, as Newsom himselfexplainedback in 2019, the State of California\u2019s initial claim to sovereignty over those who lived there is sketchy at best and illegitimate at worst, according to California Executive Order N-15-19\u2014and executive orders wouldn\u2019t lie.Plenty of the progressive activists agree. This is a struggle against colonialism\u2014as any congresswoman\u2019s Ivy League-educated daughterwill tell you.Sure, the land was taken from the Spanish crown and sold legally to the United States, and therefore its identity as \u201cMexican land\u201d is a bit of a stretch. We should respect each side\u2019s own narrative and not deny anybody\u2019s lived experience.Which is why I\u2019ve got an idea.Does the U.S. really need all of California? Of course not. Think of all the problems that can be solved with that land. What we\u2019ll again call Alto California\u2014though only the part of the original Alto California that is within the current state\u2019s borders\u2014can be retroceded to Mexico. That way Southern California (or \u201cBaja California\u201d), the part of California that America seems to care about, can remain in the U.S. Would that make Mexico suddenly noncontiguous? Sure, but there\u2019s no reason they can\u2019t just build a tunnel connecting them.It\u2019s not just about appeasing Mexico. Three years ago, the native Tongva\u2014that would be the tribe that Newsom has been directing his apologies to\u2014got their own acre of land in Los Angeles County. But one acre? California can do better than that. The Greater Los Angeles area is an enormous place, and the Tongva surely have claim to a fair share of it.But then again Malibu is a Chumash word,according to the state. Chumash is another tribe that doesn\u2019t get as much attention as the Tongva, but that shouldn\u2019t work against them. Meanwhile, Los Angeles carries a great deal of sentimental value for Mexicans as well, and it\u2019d be a shame to force them to get a passport just to see it.Now I know what you\u2019re thinking: It\u2019s getting pretty crowded here in this hypothetical Greater Los Angeles now. But that\u2019s OK\u2014sometimes justice is crowded.And there\u2019s an easy solution: Just make Los Angeles an international city! We\u2019d put the greater metropolitan area of LA under a special international regime we could refer to as a Corpus Separatum. The area is home to many religions in addition to its national minorities, so all its holy places\u2014Disneyland, the Staples Center, the Hollywood Bowl, that gas station shop on Pico Boulevard that carries kosher beef jerky\u2014would be placed under a United Nations trusteeship.And yes, of course Oakland will be demilitarized.I know this all sounds like a lot, and obviously the devil is in the details, but if what California Democrats are saying about their own state is true, then simply having Donald Trump remove the National Guard from the site of conflict isn\u2019t nearly enough. It doesn\u2019t get at theroot causes, you see. Peace isn\u2019t the same thing as justice.You might be thinking:This is all easy for you to say from thousands of miles away. And you\u2019re right: It is easy for me to say this.It\u2019s easy for me to say this because the Democratic-progressive one-size-fits-all solution to ethnic and national conflict is seared into my brain. I\u2019ve been listening to it for decades. And what I\u2019ve learned from watching progressives \u201csolve\u201d the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is that all conflicts are the same. That the historical record is a matter of opinion. That violence and mayhem should be rewarded. That in any conflict, the side wearing a uniform is the Bad Guy. That what is happening\u2014whatever it is, wherever it is\u2014simplyisn\u2019t who we are. Finally,as a Jew, I just can\u2019t stand by and watch it happen. It\u2019s time to take Democrats\u2019 advice and advance a two-state solution. You\u2019re welcome, Gavin.
