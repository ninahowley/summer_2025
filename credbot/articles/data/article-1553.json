By Dennis Pillion, Inside Climate News BIRMINGHAM, Ala.\u2014Two iron pipe manufacturers in Alabama learned last month they lost a combined $150 million in promised federal funding that would have increased productivity and employment while slashing greenhouse gas emissions and other air pollution. The grants, $75 million each, were issued to the American Cast Iron Pipe Company in Birmingham and the U.S. Pipe and Foundry Company in Bessemer through the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations to replace older coke or gas-fueled blast furnaces with electric induction furnaces. The projects were estimated to cut the greenhouse gas emissions at U.S. Pipe by 73 percent and at American Cast Iron Pipe by 62 percent. \u201cThis project is expected to reduce the cost of operations, improve manufacturing capacity, and enhance overall melting process and reliability, demonstrating the viability of electrifying a core process for iron and steel manufacturing,\u201d theU.S. Pipe project descriptionstates. The two Alabama grants were among24 clean energy awards terminated last weekby the Department of Energy, totaling $3.7 billion. The DOE said in a news release announcing the cuts that the terminated awards \u201cfailed to advance the energy needs of the American people, were not economically viable and would not generate a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars.\u201d Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in the release that the Biden administration \u201cfailed to conduct a thorough financial review\u201d before approving the projects last year. \u201cWhile the previous administration failed to conduct a thorough financial review before signing away billions of taxpayer dollars, the Trump administration is doing our due diligence to ensure we are utilizing taxpayer dollars to strengthen our national security, bolster affordable, reliable energy sources and advance projects that generate the highest possible return on investment,\u201d Wright said. \u201cToday, we are acting in the best interest of the American people by cancelling these 24 awards.\u201d Both companies have deep roots in Birmingham\u2019s industrial center and have been operating in the area for more than a century. Both make ductile iron pipes used for water and wastewater infrastructure, among other products. The projects would have decreased both facilities\u2019 reliance on coke as fuel. Coke, a purified form of coal, is created by \u201cbaking\u201d coal in high-temperature, low oxygen ovens to remove impurities. The ovens use large amounts of energy to make coke, and are often associated with numerous potentially hazardous emissions. TheNational Cancer Institute warnsthat coke oven emissions \u201ctypically include carcinogens such as cadmium and arsenic,\u201d and that \u201c[e]xposure to coke oven emissions increases the risk oflung cancerand, possibly,kidney cancer.\u201d A coke plant in Birmingham wasshuttered by local authorities due to alleged Clean Air Act violationsin 2021 and has not reopened. \u201cBy replacing the burning of coke with electric induction, this project would substantially improve air quality including reductions in particulate matter, nitrogen oxides, and sulfur oxides for nearby communities,\u201d the U.S. Pipe project description states. American Cast Iron Pipe, or ACIPCO, said it \u201cremains committed to moving forward\u201d with the project despite the loss of federal funding. \u201cAmerican is disappointed to learn that our cooperative agreement with the Department of Energy for our Next Generation Melt Project has been terminated,\u201d the company said in a released statement. \u201cOnce completed, the Next Generation Melt Project and future downstream projects will increase capacity, provide flexibility with production scheduling and add high-quality, high-paying jobs,\u201d the company said. According to the company website, the project isestimated to be completed in 2029. ACIPCO was founded in Birmingham in 1905 and employs approximately 1,600 people at its Birmingham facilities. U.S. Pipe did not respond to requests for comment from Inside Climate News or other media outlets. The company removed a 2024 press release touting the grant from its website and has not indicated whether it plans to continue the electrification project. U.S. Pipe was created in 1899 by consolidating 14 iron and steel foundries in nine states. One of those was theHoward-Harrison Iron Company in Bessemer. Local economic development agencies say U.S. Pipe employs970 people in Alabama. **** **In Miami, deportations are raising concerns among Cuban-Americans** South Florida's Cuban-American community supports President Trump, but some members are uneasy with his immigration policies. \"I'm not for deporting people without criminal records.\" **Performers and video game companies reach deal that ends nearly year-long strike** Performers who do stunt and voice work for video games went on strike in July after reaching a stalemate in negotiations over how companies can use A.I. in game development. **Trump\u2019s EPA plans to repeal climate pollution limits on fossil fuel power plants** The Trump administration plans to get rid of all limits on climate-warming pollution from the nation's fossil fuel power plants.
