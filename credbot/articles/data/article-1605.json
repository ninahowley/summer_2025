The $350 billion in state and local stimulus contained in theAmerican Rescue Planenacted in March can be used for broadband, if states choose to do so. The plan also included another$7.1 billion in emergency broadband relief, which the Federal Communications Commission authorized last month. Separately on Thursday, President Joe Biden and a bipartisan group of senators agreed on a framework for an infrastructure spending package, including $65 billion for broadband. But these federal plans often include confusing rules that restrict states from using money how they\u2019d like to, as well as outdated standards, frustrating people like Tamarah Holmes, the director of Virginia\u2019s broadband office. \u201cThere\u2019s been a disconnection between federal and state governments,\u201d Holmes wrote StateScoop in an email. \u201cWe\u2019ve invested significantly in addressing the digital divide in Virginia, and we\u2019re three times more efficient than the federal programs in terms of our investments and the number of folks we get connected through investments the Commonwealth has made.\u201d Holmes, like her counterparts in other state broadband offices, has led efforts to connect the last mile of fiber to rural homes that were previously wholly unserved by broadband providers. The FCC\u2019s Rural Digital Opportunity Fund auction late last year made some regions of Virginia eligible to be bid on by telecommunications firms, despite the fact that Holmes\u2019 office had already lined up investments, with state money, to provide service in those areas, she said. The RDOF auctionhad other hiccups, but Holmes said the lack of communication has caused headaches for her and the state\u2019s internet service providers. \u201cThere was no vehicle for us at the state to go to the FCC and say \u2018hey, we\u2019re actually investing money in these areas that you made eligible for RDOF, how can we make sure that they\u2019re removed from eligible locations?\u2019 she said. \u201cAnd we tried, but now we have providers that have won these locations through RDOF and we\u2019re trying to help them figure out how they can legally forfeit these areas without any penalty.\u201d But the FCC\u2019s standard for what counts as \u201cserved\u201d as isn\u2019t good enough either, said Teresa Ferguson, the Colorado director of federal broadband engagement. \u201cThe reality is as long as we continue to use a backwards-looking metric of 25 megabits down and 3 megabits up as the definition of broadband, then our federal agencies are going to continue to put us in this bowling-alley lane of where we can put investment and build infrastructure. That\u2019s a problem,\u201d she said. Ferguson echoed Holmes\u2019s claims that states have been better than the federal government in connecting their own residents. \u201cStates are doing it quicker, better and faster,\u201d Ferguson said. \u201cWe are rolling out fiber-to-the-home or fixed-wireless of significant bandwidth at a half or a third of the cost [of the federal government] in under two years.\u201d Even when the two parties can work in concert, the 25/3 standard \u201chas got to die,\u201d Ferguson said, and it\u2019s the federal government\u2019s job to replace it with a higher standard of connectivity. Ferguson cited rural ranchers and farmers who suffer from a lack of connectivity, while West Virginia State Sen. Robert Plymale said he was hard-pressed to find a region of West Virginia that was adequately served. \u201c[The 25/3 standard led the state being] so woefully underserved that I can\u2019t find an area of West Virginia that is properly served, to be quite honest,\u201d Plymale said. \u201cWhen you start thinking about 25/3 as the standard they set in 2012, we found through the pandemic that that wasn\u2019t even high enough to do anything.\u201d West Virginia Virginia broadband Colorado Facebook LinkedIn Twitter Copy Link **More Like This** North Carolina launches digital equity and literacy officeByRyan Johnston **North Carolina launches digital equity and literacy office** **North Carolina launches digital equity and literacy office** Bloomberg Philanthropies to fund digital innovation teams in six citiesByRyan Johnston **Bloomberg Philanthropies to fund digital innovation teams in six cities** **Bloomberg Philanthropies to fund digital innovation teams in six cities** West Virginia\u2019s CTO gets new title, more authorityByColin Wood **West Virginia\u2019s CTO gets new title, more authority** **West Virginia\u2019s CTO gets new title, more authority** **More Scoops** **North Carolina House passes \u2018historic\u2019 broadband investment** **Collaboration is key for state broadband officials** **State and local officials don\u2019t trust ISPs to close digital divide, poll finds** **Virginia announces $29M broadband expansion** **Delaware targets underserved families with $20 million broadband investment** **Latest Podcasts** **Tech** Texas AI center boosts efficiency, workforce Want to fix unemployment systems?
