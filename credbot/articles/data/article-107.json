Fire Chief Ronald Peebles was absent as he was dealing with a family matter. Brooks spoke about the May 2025 statistics the department frequently publishes. He said for the month of May, the department responded to 2,374 calls. He said many of the traffic stops (493) were given as verbal warnings instead of tickets. Brooks said the department has many spare vehicles, and he hopes to be able to fill those with officers. He added that the department is applying for a grant to help pay for two additional officers. Grace said the street department is hard at work replacing faded and missing street signs, and they hope to have its own fuel system online in July. **Grant announces candidacy for District 1 seat of Atmore City Council** **Commission moves forward with block grant disaster recovery application** **Atmore man arrested June 7 on possession, theft charges** **Final suspect in North Main, Howard Street shooting turns self into APD** Calendar of Events **Calendar of Events** **Calendar of Events** Home News Sports Opinion Lifestyles Obits Business Small Business About Us Subscribe Policies Terms of Use Submit a News Tip Submit a Photo Birth Announcement Birthday Announcement Engagement Announcement Wedding Announcement \u00a9 2025, The Atmore Advance"}
