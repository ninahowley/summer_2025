Ron Johnson, chair of the committee. What began as aU.S. Senate hearingon the failure of public health officials to adequately warn about the risk of myocarditis associated with COVID-19 vaccines quickly morphed into areferendum on vaccine safetyin general, the liability protections afforded to vaccine makers, and the failure to provide resources and compensation to the vaccine-injured. Wednesday\u2019s hearing before thePermanent Subcommittee on Investigationspitted Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), subcommittee ranking member, and Hawaii Gov. Josh Green, a doctor, staunch supporters of theCOVID-19vaccinecampaign and vaccines in general, against Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), subcommittee chair, and a panel of witnesses who criticized the government\u2019s handling ofCOVID-19. \u201cI am satisfied that our Senate hearing delivered America the truth on the COVID-19 vaccine debacle,\u201dDr. Peter McCullough, one of the witnesses, toldThe Defender. \u201cSadly, an untold number of primarily young individuals suffered devastating vaccine heart damage. Some lost their lives because of governmentagencycover-up on safety data that was emerging early in 2021.\u201d Other witnesses includedDr. Jordan Vaughn,Dr. James Thorp,Dr. Joel Wallskogandattorney Aaron Siri. Green also appeared as a witness. Children\u2019s Health DefenseCEO Mary Holland, who attended the hearing, said she was grateful to Johnson for \u201cshining a bright light on what happened during the COVID era.\u201d \u201cThe public has lost faith in the government because the government\u2019s policies were catastrophic,\u201d Holland said. \u201cSenator Johnson is leading the charge to get to the truth about what happened to our country during COVID and to ensure that nothing like it will ever happen again.\u201d Holland added: \u201cThe hearing initiated a dialogue between those of differing views, which is needed. But it was disappointing that the majority of subcommittee members either didn\u2019t show up at all or showed up for cameo appearances.\u201d Johnson warned at the close of the hearing that acknowledging and rectifying the problems of the COVID-19 era is going to take time. \u201cThis is going to be a slog,\u201d he said. He said to \u201cstay tuned\u201d for announcements of future reports and hearings on the issue, as the evidence released so far is just \u201cthe tip of the iceberg.\u201d Hearing held on the heels of 55-page report Wednesday\u2019s hearing opened with Johnson reading highlights from a55-page reportreleased by the subcommittee earlier that day. The report detailed how federal health officials in spring 2021 failed to swiftlywarn the public of the risk of myocarditisand other cardiac-related issues following COVID-19 and, instead, downplayed the risk. Along with the report, thesubcommittee released over 2,400 pagesof U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) documents, including COVID-19 vaccine safety records and communications about the COVID-19 pandemic.Johnson subpoenaed HHSfor the documents in January. Before the committee heard from witnesses, Blumenthal pushed back against the claim that federal health officials had initially hidden data about myocarditis risk. He also praised the COVID-19 vaccine, saying the \u201cmost important fact\u201d was that COVID-19vaccineshad saved \u201cmillions and millions\u201d of lives. Blumenthal\u2019s assistant placed posters behind him that echoed his claim. Later in the hearing, Siri called out Blumenthal on those claims, saying they were sourced from a blog, not from reliable data or sources. Blumenthal also showed a poster that claimed three deaths in 2025 had beencaused by measles. \u201cMisinformation about the safety of vaccines has led to a deadly outbreak of a preventable disease,\u201d he said. \u201cWe all know it: measles.\u201d He went on to make statements undermining the credibility of the witnesses, including that some profited from selling \u201cdisproven\u201d wellness treatments and suing vaccine companies. The witnesses gave testimony about what they had seen and experienced. Their comments varied greatly. Below are some highlights. Witnesses cite studies showing cardiac harm after COVID vaccines McCullough, a cardiologist and president of theMcCullough Foundation, cited numerous studies documentingsudden cardiac deathafter COVID-19 vaccination. \u201cThere are 1,065 papers in the peer-reviewed literature on COVID vaccine myocarditis. \u2026 This is in the peer-reviewedliterature,\u201d McCullough said. \u201cThis is not misinformation.\u201d McCullough said he\u2019s worried that cases of acute COVID-19 vaccine-induced myocarditis while continue until the COVID-19 vaccines are halted. \ud83d\udca5 TRUTH BOMB: Peter McCullough Doesn\u2019t Hold Back \u2014 \u201cIT WAS NOT SAFE BY DESIGN.\u201d@P_McCulloughMD: \u201cThe lethal part of the virus in the vaccinated, it\u2019s circulating in the blood \u2026 It is a KILLER PROTEIN.\u201d Bet your doctor didn\u2019t share that LIFE-ALTERING fact with you\u2026pic.twitter.com/LYhf6zNT0Z \u2014 Children\u2019s Health Defense (@ChildrensHD)May 22, 2025 Vaughn, founder and president of theMicrovascular Research Foundation, which develops \u201ceffective, research-based treatment protocols for patients suffering from Long COVID,\u201d said he\u2019s treated over 4,000 long COVID and COVID-19 vaccine injury patients. Roughly 80% of the long COVID patients took the COVID-19 vaccine, Vaughn said. The spike protein is not a \u201cbenign\u201d protein, Vaughn explained. \u201cIt triggers inflammation.\u201d He criticized the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for failing to formally alert healthcare practitioners nationwide via its Health Action Network to the vaccine\u2019s risk of myocarditis. According to the CDC, theHealth Alert Networkis the agency\u2019s \u201cprimary method of sharing cleared information about urgent public health incidents with public information officers; federal, state, territorial, tribal, and local public health practitioners; clinicians; and public health laboratories.\u201d \u201cInstead of actually giving a health alert notice to all the physicians,\u201d Vaughn said, \u201cthey decided with the help of the Biden administration to actually just update thewebsite of the CDC.\u201d Thorp, an obstetrician and gynecologist, spoke on the potential harms topregnant womenfrom the COVID-19 vaccines, which he accused former public health officials of disregarding. For instance, Thorp cited a study he co-authored that was published in February in the peer-reviewed journalScience, Public Health Policy and the Law. The study identified37 safety signalsfor COVID-19 vaccines during pregnancy, including miscarriage, fetal malformations, premature birth, stillbirth, newborn asphyxia and newborn death. Orthopedic surgeon says one COVID shot left him disabled Wallskog, a board-certified orthopedic surgeon, told the committee how he became medically disabled after one dose of Moderna\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine: \u201cI proudly elected to get vaccinated and within a week I developed leg weakness, numbness, substantial balance loss leading to falls \u2026 I have been diagnosed withdysautonomiaand an undefined autoimmune disorder, both debilitating conditions affecting multiple body systems.\u201d Wallskog is co-chair ofReact19, a nonprofit formed after the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines to help connect thoseinjured by the shotswith resources that can help them. In anX post, Wallskog called the hearing \u201ca critical step toward accountability, transparency, and justice.\u201d When it was Siri\u2019s turn to speak, he emphasized that vaccine makers \u2014 unlike drug makers \u2014 are free of the risk of being sued for injury caused by their products, thanks to theNational Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986. Vaccine companies aren\u2019t incentivized to do rigorous, multi-year, placebo-controlled safety trials, since they don\u2019t have to worry about costly lawsuits, Siri said. Hawaii governor says country is in \u2018great peril\u2019 of abandoning public health Green said he was testifying as a doctor. He blamed vaccine skepticism for the deaths of children from vaccine-preventable diseases, including COVID-19 and measles. He praised the COVID-19 vaccine, saying it lessened the severity of outcomes for those who got sick. Green said: \u201cMy heart is with everyone who had any kind of reaction to the vaccines that we\u2019re talking about or loses a loved one. Of course we love our fellow mankind, but we cannot turn away from science.\u201d He claimed the country is currently in \u201cgreat peril\u201d of no longer being \u201ccommitted to public health.\u201d Residents inHawaii recently killed a billthat was part ofGreen\u2019s legislative agendathat would have removed residents\u2019 right to religious exemptions from vaccines.
