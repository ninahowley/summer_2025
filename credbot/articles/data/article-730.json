and the Limits of the Law** \u201cTechnology favors tyranny,\u201dwrotehistorian and philosopher Yuval Noah Harari.This sentiment echoes growing concerns that rapid advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) will enable new forms of digital authoritarianism and erode democratic norms. From biased algorithms to mass surveillance, AI-enabled technologies could exacerbate inequalities and data protection concerns, while introducing new risks to individual safety, national security, and possibly even the fate ofhumanityitself. Underlying these problems is a fundamental concern about \u201cAI power\u201d \u2013 the potential for AI to shape the prospects, options, and attitudes of human beings.In an increasingly connected world, AI-based tools allow fewer individuals to shape the choices of many and at larger scales, with potentially catastrophic results. Governments, for example, use AI to surveil dissidents, track undocumented immigrants, influence elections, and allocate scarce resources. Corporations, too, rely on AI to determine the goods, services, and content available to consumers. These power shifts are already underway and poised to intensify in the next decade. In the race to acquire AI power, some will inevitably be left behind. Only a small group of countries and corporations control access to the infrastructure, computing hardware, and data needed to build and train advanced AI models. Those same actors are dominating the debate on AI governance, further entrenching the secretive, complex, and opaque nature of AI systems. The concentration of AI power raises important and difficult questions: Who benefits from AI power and what rights do they have? How does AI power create or alter human rights, duties, and obligations? Who has the proper authority to exercise AI power and under what conditions? What institutional, policy, and legal guardrails are needed to ensure this power is exercised in legitimate, just, and accountable ways? In the wake of recent policy proposals on AI \u2013 including in theUnited States,United Kingdom, and at theG7\u2013it is more crucial than ever to debate these questions. By bringing together leading technologists, political scientists, legal scholars, and ethicists, this Symposium offers recommendations to mitigate the costs and assure the just rewards of these technologies. The Symposium includes the following articles, with more published each week. Simon Chesterman, \u201cThe Tragedy of AI Governance.\u201d Gavin Wilde, \u201cThe Path to War is Paved with Obscure Intentions: Signaling and Perception in the Era of AI.\u201d John Zerilli, \u201cProcess Rights and the Automation of Public Services through AI: The Case of the Liberal State.\u201d Arthur Holland Michel,\u201cIs AI the Right Sword for Democracy?\u201d Talita de Souza Dias and Rashmin Sagoo, \u201cAI Governance in the Age of Uncertainty: International Law as a Starting Point.\u201d Kalya Blomquist and Keegan McBride, \u201cIt\u2019s Not Just Technology: What it Means to be a Global Leader in AI.\u201d **Share** **About the Author** Dr. Brianna Rosen (Bluesky-LinkedIn-X) is Senior Fellow and Director of the Artificial Intelligence and Emerging Technologies (AIET) Initiative at Just Security. She is also a Senior Research Associate at the University of Oxford and previously served for a decade in the U.S. government, including at the White House National Security Council and Office of the Vice President. **Featured Articles:** **The Mounting Crisis of Militarizing Immigration Enforcement** **The Just Security Podcast: A Conversation with Jen Easterly \u2014 Cybersecurity at a Crossroads** **\u201cThe Insurrection Act\u201d by Any Other Name: Unpacking Trump\u2019s Memorandum Authorizing Domestic Deployment of the Military** **Getting to Yes on the Plastics Agreement: Time for More Plasticity?** DON'T MISS A THING.Stay up to date withJust Securitycurated newsletters: About Us Key Topics Masthead Series Write For Us Resources Contact Podcast **Support** Just Securityprovides expert analysis and informational resources on the issues that matter most\u2014without paywalls, subscriptions, or ads.Just Securityis an editorially independent, non-partisan, daily digital law and policy journal housed in the Reiss Center on Law and Security at the New York University School of Law.
