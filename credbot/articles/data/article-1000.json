For Black men in particular, routine checkups and annual screenings are more than just good practice\u2014they arecritical. Despite ongoing advancements in medicine, Black men continue to face some of the highest rates of chronic illness and early mortality in the United States. Regular health screenings can play a crucial role in closing that gap. **The Reality: A health disparity that can\u2019t be ignored.** Statistically, Black men are more likely to develop and die from conditions like heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, andcertain cancers, particularly prostate and colorectal cancer. According to the American Cancer Society, Black men have thehighest cancer death rateof any racial or ethnic group in the U.S. Luckily, many of these illnesses are preventable or manageable when caught early. Yet,studies showthat Black men are less likely than other groups to get regular medical checkups and their yearly screenings. According to Dr. Samantha Somwaru, a family medicine physician, the reasons range from lack of access to healthcare and financial barriers to systemic racism, mistrust of the medical system, and cultural stigma around showing vulnerability. \u201cAs a family physician, I come across many people who don\u2019t utilize preventive screenings for various reasons, but some of them truly have limited barriers to getting good care,\u201d Dr. Somwaruexplainedduring a 2023 interview with the Mayo Clinic. \u201cRacial and social disparities are some examples that continue to exist and affect the entire country, especially the Black population. Each must be examined and addressed to reduce health disparities and save lives.\u201d She also pointed out that accessibility is a major barrier. Scheduling routine screenings isn\u2019t always simple. It often requires reliable transportation, health insurance, health literacy, time off from work, and family support. When these resources are lacking, patients are far less likely to seek preventive care. **Why early checkups matter.** Routine medical visits can help identify risk factors long before symptoms show up. Many chronic conditions and cancers, such as hypertension, diabetes, or prostate cancer, often develop silently in their early stages, making regular screenings and lab tests critical for early detection when treatment is most effective. Preventative care during these visits also reduces the risk of serious illness, as doctors can offer vaccines, suggest lifestyle changes, and recommend proactive treatments. For those already managing chronic conditions, ongoing medical attention helps maintain stability and avoid complications. Regular checkups also provide a safe space to address mental health concerns, something that\u2019s often overlooked, especially among Black men, due to cultural stigma. These appointments can be a gateway to therapy, support services, and broader wellness. **Breaking the cycle: Empowerment through knowledge.** Seeing a doctor early and often shouldn\u2019t be a last resort. It\u2019s a form of self-respect and empowerment. Reframing healthcare as a proactive, strength-based step\u2014rather than a reaction to sickness\u2014can help dismantle generational barriers to care. Thankfully, community health initiatives, Black-led health organizations, and trusted voices in Black communities are increasingly stepping up to encourage regular screenings and doctor visits among Black men. For example, the Annual Black Men\u2019s Wellness Day, held in various cities, is a community event that focuses onraising awarenessabout health issues disproportionately affecting Black men and providing free screenings. It\u2019s a huge step forward, but real change also starts on an individual level with one person deciding their life and well-being are worth prioritizing. **What to ask during a checkup?** If it\u2019s been a while since your last visit to the doctor, it\u2019s important to come prepared with key topics to discuss\u2014especially if you want to take a proactive approach to your health. Start by asking about your blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and blood sugar, as these are vital indicators of heart disease, diabetes, and other chronic conditions that often go unnoticed in their early stages. If you\u2019re over 40 or have a family history of cancer, be sure to request screenings for prostate and colon cancer, which are more treatable when caught early. It\u2019s also a good idea to check in on your mental health and share any mood changes, sleep issues, or stress you may be experiencing, as your primary care provider can help connect you with mental health support if needed. Don\u2019t forget to review your vaccine status and ask about any recommended boosters or preventative shots. Lastly, take the opportunity to discuss your daily habits, such as diet, exercise, alcohol use, and smoking. Small lifestyle adjustments can have a big impact on your long-term health. Black men, don\u2019t wait for a wake-up call. Early checkups aren\u2019t just about avoiding illness, they\u2019re about reclaiming control, protecting families, and breaking cycles. Don\u2019t wait until something feels wrong. Go to the doctor, ask the hard questions, and advocate for your health because your life depends on it.
