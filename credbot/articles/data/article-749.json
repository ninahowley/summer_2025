(KGUN) \u2014 Arizona ranks48th in the nation for access to mental health care, according to a report by Mental Health America. In response to this critical shortage, a new facility in Green Valley is working to expand access to mental health and substance abuse treatment in rural Southern Arizona. TheHaven Detox Arizonaopened its doors earlier this year, aiming to bridge a long-standing gap in behavioral health care for rural communities. \u201cTucson has great resources,\u201d said Felicia Dadamio, Director of Business Development at the Haven. \u201cBut in these rural pockets and in these rural counties, where are they going and where are they getting help?\u201d The facility offers a wide range of services, including detox programs, inpatient mental health care, and evidence-based therapies such as dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT), cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), and trauma-focused therapy. The Haven also integrates holistic wellness options like yoga, meditation, group cooking classes andGeneSight testing, a form of genetic testing that helps identify which medications may be most effective for a patient. Crucially, the facility accepts the Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System (AHCCCS), along with tribal health programs like the American Indian Health Program (AIHP), Tribal ALTCS, and the Tribal Regional Behavioral Health Authority (TRBHA). This makes it one of the few treatment centers in the area accessible to many Medicaid and tribal health recipients. For Marcus Bia, now a lead behavioral technician at the Haven, finding a facility that accepted AHCCCS made all the difference. \u201cI did ultimately try to do it on my own multiple times and I was unsuccessful every time,\u201d Bia said. \u201cI needed that sense of community. I needed that support.\u201d Insurance was a barrier he struggled with for years. \u201cIt was hard finding resources that did accept my insurance,\u201d Bia recalled. \u201cWithout places like this accepting AHCCCS, I would not be here. I truly believe that.\u201d Today, Bia is part of the support system he once relied on. \u201cIt\u2019s very important to me to kind of give that support out and give everyone the chance they deserve,\u201d he said. Treatment programs at the Haven typically last 30 days, but recovery support doesn\u2019t end there. The facility\u2019s case managers help clients plan next steps in their recovery journey. An active alumni network provides ongoing peer support, care coordination, and access to recovery resources. \u201cYou\u2019re finally able to learn how to process some of these emotions, to work through them,\u201d Bia said. \u201cIt\u2019s just how you handle them and how you go about coping with them.\u201d To learn more about the Haven Detox Arizona, visit thecenter\u2019s website.
