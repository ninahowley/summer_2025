Sudais Abdi Omar, of Brooklyn Park, was shot in the chest Friday in the mall\u2019s Best Buy parking lot and pronounced dead at Mercy Hospital in Coon Rapids. Ayub Abdullahi Mohamed, 20, was one of three suspects who was seen running from the shooting and into the mall. He was arrested at SkyZone Trampoline Park and had a gun magazine in his sock, the criminal complaint says. The two other suspects are ages 14 and 15, the complaint says. They have not been arrested, and the investigation remains ongoing, the Anoka County Sheriff\u2019s Office said Tuesday afternoon. Mohamed remained at the Anoka County Jail on Tuesday in lieu of $100,000 bail. A message left for his attorney for comment on the charge has not been returned. In March, Mohamed was charged with aiding and abetting second-degree manslaughter for allegedly bringing a rifle into a car on Feb. 28 in Columbia Heights. A 16-year-old boy handled the rifle, not knowing a bullet was in the chamber, when it fired and killed the driver, Ibrahim Faisal Dabarani, 20, of Minneapolis, according to the complaint against Mohamed, who then posted bond. The teen also faces the same manslaughter charge, and a hearing to certify him as an adult is set for July 17. According to Tuesday\u2019s complaint, Blaine officers were called to the Best Buy parking lot about 5:15 p.m. on a report of someone who\u2019d been shot. Once there, they were told that several people involved fled the area. Omar was found in the parking lot with a gunshot wound to the chest. Casings were found nearby. The 911 caller, a Best Buy employee, said he saw three male suspects run from the shooting scene and into the mall, then out the door toward Sky Zone. Witnesses gave the suspects\u2019 descriptions and officers located Mohamed in a Sky Zone bathroom. **Related Articles** St. Paul police looking for hit-and-run driver who critically injured pedestrian Eichorn argues federal prosecutors singling him out after child sex sting Sean \u2018Diddy\u2019 Combs\u2019 ex says she joined \u2018cuckold\u2019 sex marathons to feel loved by him Weinstein jury pores over accuser\u2019s emails during deliberations Weinstein jury set to keep deliberating after tensions spill into public In an interview with investigators, Mohamed said he was in a car with Omar and a teen identified in the complaint as Suspect #1. Mohamed said they went to Best Buy to pick up Suspect #2, who had been waiting outside the store. When they arrived, Mohamed said, he went inside Best Buy to use the bathroom. As he was walking back to the car, he saw the teens running into the store and screaming that Omar had been shot. Mohamed said he went outside and saw Omar lying on the ground. The two teens were pacing around the parking lot before Suspect #2 handed him the gun magazine, Mohamed said, adding he put it into the pocket of his throbe. Mohamed told investigators that once he got into Sky Zone, he called the teens through Snapchat, but they declined his calls. **Share this:** Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Facebook
