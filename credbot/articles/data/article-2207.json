Answer: To not do anything that would effectively slow the spread of the coronavirus. West Fargo, ND \u2013 Rather than imposing a mask mandate like neighboring Fargo finally did, West Fargo\u2019s wizards of smart decided to implement a Mask Strategy. You may ask: What is West Fargo\u2019s mask strategy? Apparently West Fargo\u2019s mask strategy is to \u201cstrongly encourage\u201d the wearing of masks without hurting the feelings of any pandemically-challenged people who think wearing a mask is just too difficult. (Most anti-maskers realize too late that being intubated is a lot more difficult than simply wearing a mask.) Unfortunately, it seems that strong encouragement and invitations for personal responsibility don\u2019t get through to blockheads that either don\u2019t understand the serious nature of a highly contagious pandemic or whose stubbornness will eventually lead to our collective demise. The FM Observer would like to congratulate the West Fargo City Commission on having a special meeting to come up with a strategy that has less teeth than a jellyfish and which will result in zero effect toward stemming the tidal wave of exponential covidian spread.
