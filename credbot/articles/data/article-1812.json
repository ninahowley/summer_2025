He wants it to become the 51st state of the United States. Trump revealed this plan on his platform, Truth Social, on May 27, 2025. His pitch followed the announcement of a massive new missile defense system, the\u201cGolden Dome,\u201d designed to protect the US from threats on Earth and in space. While Canada has repeatedly dismissed the idea of joining its southern neighbor, Trump\u2019s pitch has sparked fresh debate about sovereignty, security, and the ties that bind these two nations. Let\u2019s dive into what Trump\u2019s offer involves, why he believes Canada should accept it, and how this proposal fits into a larger global context. **Trump\u2019s Grand Bargain** Trump\u2019s message to Canadawas blunt and direct. If Canada chooses to stay separate, it would cost them $61 billion. On the other hand, if they agree to join the US as the 51st state, that figure would drop to zero. According to Trump, Canada wants to join the \u201cGolden Dome System,\u201d his new missile defense plan. This proposal is his latest attempt to convince Canada to consider becoming the 51st state. The Golden Dome is a $176 billion project aimed at countering advanced threats from China and Russia. It promises to intercept missiles at four stages of flight, from launch to final approach. Therefore, Trump sees it as a vital shield for the US and, potentially, for Canada too. Despite these promises, Canada has heard similar rhetoric before. Former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau made it clear that joining the US was never an option. Similarly, Canada\u2019s new Prime Minister, Mark Carney, echoed this stance after his April 28 election. His message was short and firm: \u201cCanada is never for sale.\u201d Read More:Trump\u2019s Tariffs Are Here, and People Are Sharing Their Receipts **What\u2019s the Golden Dome?** The Golden Dome isn\u2019t just a catchy name. Rather, it signals a major leap in missile defense. Trump announced the plan on May 20, 2025, as the Pentagon raised alarms about new threats in space. China and Russia have developed weapons that can target satellites and disrupt defense systems. General Chance Saltzman, head of the US Space Force, believes the Golden Dome is essential. Specifically, it\u2019s meant to intercept enemy missiles at four points: before launch, during launch, midcourse, and just before impact. This system would give the US a strong advantage in defending its territory. Such an advantage is exactly what Trump believes Canada would gain if it becomes part of the United States. However, critics see the Golden Dome as a potential threat to global security. As expected, North Korea and China have both voiced their concerns. **North Korea and China\u2019s Insight** North Korea quickly condemned the Golden Dome plan. In a statement to the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA), its foreign ministry called the system \u201cvery dangerous.\u201d It accused the US of trying to control outer space and warned that the program could start a new arms race. Likewise, China voiced its opposition. Foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said the plan undermines the security of other countries. He argued that the US is putting its own safety above all else and ignoring the global balance of power. As a result, China called for the US to halt the project. These reactions highlight a key fear: that space is becoming the next battleground. The Golden Dome could push other countries to expand their own military programs, making the world less safe.

Trump\u2019s offer might seem like a stunt, but it also reveals real pressure on Canada to align with US defense plans. Yet Canada stands firm. Prime Minister Carney didn\u2019t hesitate to reject Trump\u2019s pitch. Like Trudeau before him, Carney said Canada\u2019s future lies in partnership with the US, not as part of it. His words reflect a deep belief in Canada\u2019s independence and its role on the world stage. At the same time, Trump\u2019s claim that Canada is \u201cconsidering the offer\u201d of joining the US as the 51st state lacks evidence. News channels reached out to Canada for comment but received no official response. Thus, Canada\u2019s position remains unchanged, and becoming Canada as 51st state isn\u2019t on the table. **What Does This Mean for the Future?** At first glance, Trump\u2019s proposal seems like another headline grabber. However, it also points to deeper concerns about global security. The Golden Dome shows that space is the next frontier for defense. Satellites and missile systems are no longer science fiction, they\u2019re real and growing. For Canada, joining the US isn\u2019t just about saving money. Rather, it\u2019s about staying true to its national identity. Canada values its close ties to the US but draws a clear line at becoming part of the United States. Therefore, the Golden Dome and the pressure it brings won\u2019t change that. Canada will continue to watch from the sidelines, working with the US when it chooses, but never giving up its own voice. Any talk of Canada joining the US as a new state is firmly off the table for now. **Closing Thoughts** In the end, Trump\u2019s pitch to make Canada the 51st state under the \u201cGolden Dome\u201d is both bold and controversial. It reflects his belief in American dominance and his willingness to push hard for it. At the same time, it shows the growing tensions in a world where space is now part of military strategy. For now, Canada isn\u2019t buying in. Its leaders are clear: the country will keep its independence, no matter the cost or the promises on the table. As the US, China, and others build their arsenals in space, Canada\u2019s quiet \u201cno\u201d to becoming a potential US state might be the strongest statement of all.
