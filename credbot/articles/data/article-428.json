The asteroid has been named2016-FIand measures approximately 1 km across. If it strikes a populated area is could wipe out entire cities and potentially devastate an entire continent or \u2026 nah. I\u2019m totally messing with you. There\u2019s no asteroid (at least not about to strike next week). But there isa new study by computer scientists at Columbia University and the French National Institutethat has found that 59 percent of links shared on social media have never actually been clicked, meaning that most people who share news on social media aren\u2019t actually reading it first, and that\u2019ll probably apply to this article as well. For the study, Arnaud Legout and co-authors collected two data sets: the first, on all tweets containing Bit.ly-shortened links to five major news sources during a one-month period last summer; the second, on all of the clicks attached to that set of shortened links, as logged by Bit.ly, during the same period. After cleaning and collating that data, the researchers basically found themselves with a map to how news goes viral on Twitter. The map showed \u201cviral\u201d news is widely shared but not necessarily read. According to the Washington Post, one thing study authors say is concerning about this is that it shapes the way we see the world. Legout said in a statement: \u201cPeople are more willing to share an article than read it. This is typical of modern information consumption. People form an opinion based on a summary, or a summary of summaries, without making the effort to go deeper.\u201d This probably won\u2019t shock most people. We see it all the time in comments sections \u2013 people making loud proclamations about stories they clearly haven\u2019t read. Entire discussions are chaired by those who didn\u2019t actually read the article. It\u2019s maddening. What can you do about it? Read the article, of course, and don\u2019t share things you haven\u2019t read. Being informed is being responsible. So, have you made it this far or are you busy building a makeshift shelter in your basement? If you read it and want to comment, work a colour \u2013 red, blue, yellow, pink, whatever \u2013 into your comment, would you? But don\u2019t ruin the headline for everyone else, OK? Thanks. You\u2019re the best.
