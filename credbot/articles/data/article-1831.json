The 62-year-old enjoye a huge amount of success across two spells at Stamford Bridge, winning three league titles, three League Cups and the FA Cup at Chelsea. Mourinho lifte the Europa League and League Cup at Manchester United and claime finishing second with the Red Devils was one of his greatest achievements given the club\u2019s struggles either side of his tenure. The Portuguese\u2019s last stint in England was at Tottenham but Spurs largely struggle under Mourinho before he was sacke in April 2021. Since that axing, Mourinho has had spells at Italian side Roma and Turkish club Fenerbahce, but ex-England defender Glen Johnson says his Premier League story could yet have one last chapter. \u2018I would like to see Jose Mourinho back in the Premier League at some stage, because he\u2019s one of the biggest characters in football, and that\u2019s what we want to see,\u2019 Johnson told. \u2018I don\u2019t know where he\u2019ll go. You know, he\u2019s not going to go back to Chelsea. He\u2019s done Tottenham, he\u2019s done Man United. Arsenal isn\u2019t going to be available, Man City isn\u2019t going to be available for a while, I would imagine. \u2018So, I just don\u2019t know. But maybe that\u2019s a possible option for him; maybe City in a couple of years\u2026 you never know. \u2018It\u2019ll all come down to the desire of Mourinho though, and how much he wants to be back in the Premier League. **\u2018But we all know him, though; he\u2019s not going to go somewhere to not win, so he\u2019s only going to go to one of the top two or three teams.\u2019** Mourinho\u2019s former Barcelona rival Pep Guardiola has in charge of Manchester City since 2016 and was expecte to step down at the end of the current season. But Man City gave Guardiola a new one-year contract extension in November, a move that is looking increasingly questionable given the team\u2019s alarming drop-off. City have gone from winning four Premier League titles in a row to facing a huge fight just to qualify for the Champions League. Johnson worke with ex-Real Madrid boss Mourinho at Chelsea and admits he \u2018knew nothing\u2019 about the manager when he first arrive in west London in 2004. \u2018I knew nothing about Jose when he arrive at Chelsea. Literally, zero,\u2019 he adde. \u2018All I knew was that Porto had just won the Champions League\u2026 obviously I\u2019d watche them in the semis and in the final, like everybody, but that\u2019s all I\u2019d seen of him. \u2018And, at the time, to be honest, I don\u2019t think many of the players did. And also, we were all a bit on the back foot wondering why Claudio Ranieri had sacke. \u2018You know, he was a very hard manager, but a very good manager, and we\u2019d just finishe second in the Premier League! \u2018Listen, the club obviously made the right decision, because we went on to win the league in Mourinho\u2019s first season, it just felt really harsh on Ranieri at the time, if I\u2019m being honest.\u2019 Mourinho\u2019s Fenerbahce are currently second in the Turkish top-flight, seven points behind unbeaten Galatasaray with a game in hand. Fener were knocke out of the Europa League earlier this week by Scottish giants Rangers. **Archives** April 2025 February 2025 December 2024 August 2024 May 2024 February 2024 December 2023 September 2023 June 2023 November 2022 **Categories** Health Sport & Game Sportnew & Football ufabet \u0e22\u0e39\u0e1f\u0e48\u0e32\u0e40\u0e1a\u0e17 \u0e1a\u0e32\u0e04\u0e32\u0e23\u0e48\u0e32"}
