The ARB will begin hearing taxpayer protests on June 11, 2025. After the ARB completes its hearings and approves final property tax appraisals, local governments will use these appraisals to set 2025 property tax rates. The ARB is an independent, impartial group of citizens authorized to resolve disputes between taxpayers and the appraisal district. It is not controlled by the appraisal district. Pursuant to Section 6.41 of the Texas Property Tax Code, Appraisal Review Board Members are appointed by the District's Board of Directors. Property owners may protest any of the following issues to the ARB: \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 the appraised or market value of the property; \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 unequal appraisal of the taxpayer's property compared to similar property in the district; \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 inclusion of the property on the appraisal records; \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 denial of a partial exemption, such as a homestead exemption; \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 denial of special appraisals, such as agricultural or timber productivity appraisals; \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 determination that agricultural or timber land has had a change of use and is subject to a rollback tax; \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 identification of the taxing unit or units in which the property is located; \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 determination that the taxpayer is the owner of the property; \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 temporary disaster damage exemption was denied or modified; \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 incorrect damage assessment rating for a property qualified for a temporary disaster exemption: or \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2\u00c2 any other action of the appraisal office that adversely affects the owner. A property owner must file a written notice of protest by June 9th or within 30 days after the appraisal district mails the taxpayer a notice of appraised value, whichever is later. The ARB schedules a hearing and sends the protesting property owner written notice of the date, time, and place of his or her hearing. The law contains specific timelines and procedures for the owner and the ARB throughout the appraisal protest process. These are detailed in the state Comptroller?s publication, Property Taxpayer Remedies. A copy of the 2025 Property Taxpayer Remedies were mailed out with each Notice of Appraised Value.
