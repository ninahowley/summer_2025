Poland\u2019s government has won a vote of confidence in parliament called by Prime Minister Donald Tusk in the wake of this month\u2019spresidential election victoryby opposition-aligned conservative Karol Nawrocki. Had he not received the confidence of a majority in parliament, Tusk would have had to resign. In a vote on Wednesday afternoon, 243 members of the Sejm, the more powerful lower house of parliament, supported the government while 210 were against. There were no abstentions. All of the votes in favour of Tusk\u2019s administration came from the four groups that make up the ruling camp: his centrist Civic Coalition (KO), the centre-right Polish People\u2019s Party (PSL), centrist Poland 2050 (Polska 2050) and The Left (Lewica). All opposition parties voted against it, including the national-conservative Law and Justice (PiS), the largest opposition party, the far-right Confederation (Konfederacja), but also the left-wing Together (Razem) party that until last yearcaucused with the ruling coalition before breaking with it. How members of each parliamentary caucus voted in the vote of confidence in Donald Tusk\u2019s government (za = for, przeciw = against) Tusk\u2019s governmenttook power in December 2023, replacing the former PiS administration. However, it has found itself hampered by the presence of President Andrzej Duda, a PiS ally, who has the power to block legislation by vetoing it or sending it to the PiS-aligned constitutional court. The ruling coalition had hoped that its candidate, Rafa\u0142 Trzaskowski, would win the presidential election run-off on 1 June, thereby ending the current political deadlock. However, Nawrocki\u2019s victory means that much of Tusk\u2019s agenda will remain impossible to implement. That has raised questions about the effectiveness \u2013 and even viability \u2013 of the government during the remaining two years of its term in office. In response, Tusklast week announced he would hold a vote of confidenceto demonstrate that he still had the support of parliament. On Wednesday morning, ahead of the vote, Tusk gave a speech to the Sejm in which he defended the record of his administration, noting that it has increasedspending on defenceandsocial supportto record levels while also overseeing adecline in inflation. \u201cWe have thehighest economic growth in Europe, the lowest unemployment rates,rising investmentlevels andrising real wages,\u201d said the prime minister, while also declaring that, under his government, Poland now \u201creturned to the top of European and world politics\u201d. Tusk pointed out that, over the last two years, Poland has had four elections \u2013parliamentary,local,Europeanandpresidential\u2013 and that his coalition has triumphed in three of them. \u201cIt\u2019s 3-1 to us, but we conceded the last goal,\u201d said the prime minister, who is a big football fan, quoted byGazeta Wyborcza.

This is our obvious duty, even if I understand the mood of those who now feel the bitterness of defeat.\u201d The prime minister did, however, confirm that next month there would be a government reshuffle. Media reports have suggested that a number of ministers could lose their jobs and some departments could be merged. Tusk also confirmed that the government would this monthappoint a spokesperson for the first time since coming to power 18 months ago. Some in the ruling coalition have blamed a lack of clear communication for the government\u2019s unpopularity. A poll by state research agency CBOS last month found that only 32% of Poles hold a positive view of the government while 44% have a negative one. Poland\u2019s government will appoint a spokesperson for the first time since taking office 18 months ago, as pressure mounts following its defeat in Sunday\u2019s presidential election. Media reports also indicate a major government reshuffle is being preparedhttps://t.co/mmb4ZU3yCY \u2014 Notes from Poland \ud83c\uddf5\ud83c\uddf1 (@notesfrompoland)June 6, 2025 PiS MPs chose not to be present in the chamber for Tusk\u2019s speech, instead gathering outside the Sejm, where the party\u2019s leader, Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski, spoke to the media. He accused the Tusk government of overseeing \u201ca completebreakdown of the rule of lawin Poland\u201d,mismanaging public finances, andfavouring German interestsover Polish ones, reports news website wPolityce. Kaczy\u0144ski last week called on the government to step down and be replaced by a \u201ctechnical\u201d administration made up of \u201capolitical experts\u201d. Today in the Sejm, PiS MP Janusz Kowalski said he hoped that Nawrocki\u2019s victory could lead to early parliamentary elections to choose a new government. \u201cOn 1 June 2025, the Donald Tusk project ended, just as communism once ended,\u201d said Kowalski, quoted by news website Onet. \ud83d\udfe5 Rz\u0105d Tuska mo\u017ce by\u0107 oceniony wy\u0142\u0105cznie bardzo negatywnie.
