Fathi Abdulrahim Harara and Native Grounds LLC are accused of violating Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination based on race, color, religion, or national origin in places of public accommodation. The matter is also the subject of a private lawsuit by the Anti-Defamation League and other groups. In the ADLcomplaintin the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, there are details on how a Jewish customer was alleged to have been chased from the business by its owner and an employee. Michael Radice, visited Jerusalem Coffee House in July 2024, wearing a baseball cap with a Star of David icon and the phrase \u201cAm Yisrael Chai\u201d \u2014 or \u201cthe people of Israel live.\u201d In approaching the business, Radice says that he was confronted by a man sitting outside who demanded, \u201cAre you a Jew?\u201d After Mr. Radice answered affirmatively, the man verbally attacked him and accused him of being \u201cresponsible\u201d for \u201ckilling children.\u201d Radice decided to go back to the business the following month and discovered that the man was an employee at the shop. He alleges that the man with the owner and a third employee forced him to leave and then followed him down the street yelling, \u201cYou\u2019re the guy with the hat. You\u2019re the Jew. You\u2019re the Zionist. We don\u2019t want you in our coffee shop. Get out.\u201d As Mr. Radice walked away, three men followed him, and he heard them calling him \u201cJew\u201d and \u201cZionist.\u201d The federal lawsuit notes that, on the first anniversary of the Oct. 7 Hamas terrorist attacks on Israel, the Jerusalem Coffee House announced two new drinks: \u201cIced In Tea Fada,\u201d an obvious reference to \u201cintifada.\u201d It also introduced as drink, \u201cSweet Sinwar,\u201d an apparent reference to Yahya Sinwar, the former leader of Hamas who orchestrated the massacre. It alsoallegesthat the coffee house\u2019s exterior side wall displays inverted red triangles, a symbol of violence against Jews that has been spray-painted on Jewish homes and synagogues in anti-Semitic attacks. Under Title II, the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Rights Division can seek to force changes in how the coffee shop must remedy alleged discriminatory conduct. In the meantime, the shop will face demands for civil damages in the private lawsuit. While customers appear undisturbed by drinks named after a mass murderer, the shop itself is likely to find what is coming a bit harder to swallow. It is now facing litigation on two fronts over the treatment of Jewish customers. **Share this:** Click to share on X (Opens in new window)X Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)Reddit Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Facebook Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window)Email **Like this:** **Post navigation** **178 thoughts on \u201cThe Justice Department Sues California Coffee Shop Over Discrimination Against Jewish Customers\u201d** **Comment navigation** Diogenessays:June 11, 2025 at 6:26 PMThis just in\u2026 the Democrat Civil War 2.0 is opening a new front in Washington State.

Right ????Of course, the 303 case was a completely bogus, manufactured case, and not really relevant to anything.Lorie Smith claimed that she had a business building wedding websites, but she admitted that she had never actually built a website for anyone.She sued the State of Colorado because she feared she MIGHT run afoul of Colorado\u2019s anti-discrimination laws, and be charged by the state if she refused to build a site for a same sex couple.She claimed that someone named Stewart had asked her to build a website for a same sex wedding, but the mysterious \u201cStewart\u201d never materialized. This claim was later found to be false.So in reality, no one at all, let alone a same sex couple, had asked her to build a website.Of course, the looney tunes SCOTUS conservatives twisted themselves into pretzels to manufacture a totally bogus ruling against Colorado.Loading...Replyoldmanfromkansassays:June 11, 2025 at 4:14 PMShe sought a declaratory judgment under the Declaratory Judgments Act.

Israel\u2019s wealth lay not under the ground, but in its people who are exiles, pilgrims and dreamers from around the world who made the desert bloom into a hi-tech superpower.Continuing his message, he related to Israel\u2019s neighbors, saying that \u201cthey failed to appreciate how following Israel\u2019s example could have brought prosperity to the region. Instead, they chose war. They decided to impoverish their people in a futile effort to destroy Israel. They succeeded in the former while failing in the latter.\u201dWhy were these words so penetratingly deep? Because they perfectly encapsulate the two sides with precise accuracy \u2013 characterizing Israelis as builders, innovators, creators, wealth makers and those whose legacy will leave behind a better world than the one they found. In contrast to that description, Rubio portrays the other side as having squandered and wasted their resources, choosing to inflict pain, suffering, poverty and a bitter existence for their people as well as those they call their enemy.Ironically, despite all of their concerted energies, they utterly failed at their mission to eradicate the Jewish state which they see as a blight against mankind. It is reflected in their present situation of defeat, shame and a population who, instead of reaping the promised bounty, has been left homeless and beaten down by their own ruthless leadership.https://allisraelnews.com/blog/rubio-gets-itLoading...Replydgsnowdensays:June 11, 2025 at 4:40 PMPerhaps Rubio would be so kind as to offer all those mothers and children \u2018left homeless and beaten down by their own ruthless leadership\u2019 a home.Where should they go?

Perhaps Hamas would be so kind as not to use the Gazan people as human shields.In the Middle East, peace is very easy to achieve: don\u2019t attack Israel and wage aggressive war against her, and you will have peace. The Arabs have 22 states and virtually all the oil. The Jews have one state on a tiny strip of desert with no oil to speak of. Just leave Israel alone. Very simple.

What followed wasn\u2019t peace; it was rockets, terror tunnels, and, ultimately, the October 7 massacre.Listen to Hamas in their own words: their charter calls for the destruction of Israel, not coexistence.

Your history of his support is insufficient to make that argument, but let us assume you are right. The Israeli people deserve to be left alone. That is what they wanted pre-1948 and post-1948. The Arabs wouldn\u2019t permit that. It was the same in 1967 and 1973, along with the smaller wars in between and between all the rocket attacks and suicide bombings.There will or should be no further compromise with the people in this area who kill their own and use terror in other parts of the world.

The Jewish people had a land, a language, a legal system, and a capital city thousands of years before the First Amendment existed.Israel is not a theocracy. It is the nation-state of the Jewish people, just as Japan is for the Japanese or Greece for the Greeks. That doesn\u2019t mean every Jew is Israeli or that every Israeli is religious. It means the Jewish people, like every other people, have the right to self-determination in their ancestral homeland.Judaism does not make theological claims meant for all mankind.

It means the Jewish people, like every other people, have the right to self-determination in their ancestral homeland.Judaism does not make theological claims meant for all mankind.

Israel\u2019s wealth lay not under the ground, but in its people who are exiles, pilgrims and dreamers from around the world who made the desert bloom into a hi-tech superpower.Continuing his message, he related to Israel\u2019s neighbors, saying that \u201cthey failed to appreciate how following Israel\u2019s example could have brought prosperity to the region. Instead, they chose war. They decided to impoverish their people in a futile effort to destroy Israel. They succeeded in the former while failing in the latter.\u201dWhy were these words so penetratingly deep? Because they perfectly encapsulate the two sides with precise accuracy \u2013 characterizing Israelis as builders, innovators, creators, wealth makers and those whose legacy will leave behind a better world than the one they found. In contrast to that description, Rubio portrays the other side as having squandered and wasted their resources, choosing to inflict pain, suffering, poverty and a bitter existence for their people as well as those they call their enemy.Ironically, despite all of their concerted energies, they utterly failed at their mission to eradicate the Jewish state which they see as a blight against mankind.

Judaism is not just a \u201cfaith\u201d; it is a people, a civilization, and a national identity that predates most modern concepts of nation-states. The Jewish people had a land, a language, a legal system, and a capital city thousands of years before the First Amendment existed.Israel is not a theocracy. It is the nation-state of the Jewish people, just as Japan is for the Japanese or Greece for the Greeks. That doesn\u2019t mean every Jew is Israeli or that every Israeli is religious. It means the Jewish people, like every other people, have the right to self-determination in their ancestral homeland.Judaism does not make theological claims meant for all mankind. That\u2019s why Israel as a Jewish state is no more a \u201cviolation\u201d of the First Amendment than Italy being Italian.Gross ignorance isn\u2019t in pointing that out; it\u2019s in denying people their history.Loading...Replydgsnowdensays:June 11, 2025 at 5:57 PMIsrael is not the \u2018nation-state\u2019 of Judaism .. . and Bibi is definitely not it\u2019s Chief Rabbi.The theological claims of Judaism apply to all those willing to accept them. .. not just a \u2018chosen people\u2019 S.

Israel\u2019s wealth lay not under the ground, but in its people who are exiles, pilgrims and dreamers from around the world who made the desert bloom into a hi-tech superpower. Continuing his message, he related to Israel\u2019s neighbors, saying that \u201cthey failed to appreciate how following Israel\u2019s example could have brought prosperity to the region. Instead, they chose war. They decided to impoverish their people in a futile effort to destroy Israel. They succeeded in the former while failing in the latter.\u201d Why were these words so penetratingly deep? Because they perfectly encapsulate the two sides with precise accuracy \u2013 characterizing Israelis as builders, innovators, creators, wealth makers and those whose legacy will leave behind a better world than the one they found. In contrast to that description, Rubio portrays the other side as having squandered and wasted their resources, choosing to inflict pain, suffering, poverty and a bitter existence for their people as well as those they call their enemy. Ironically, despite all of their concerted energies, they utterly failed at their mission to eradicate the Jewish state which they see as a blight against mankind. It is reflected in their present situation of defeat, shame and a population who, instead of reaping the promised bounty, has been left homeless and beaten down by their own ruthless leadership. https://allisraelnews.com/blog/rubio-gets-it dgsnowdensays:June 11, 2025 at 4:40 PMPerhaps Rubio would be so kind as to offer all those mothers and children \u2018left homeless and beaten down by their own ruthless leadership\u2019 a home.Where should they go?

The Jewish people had a land, a language, a legal system, and a capital city thousands of years before the First Amendment existed.Israel is not a theocracy. It is the nation-state of the Jewish people, just as Japan is for the Japanese or Greece for the Greeks. That doesn\u2019t mean every Jew is Israeli or that every Israeli is religious.

Israel\u2019s wealth lay not under the ground, but in its people who are exiles, pilgrims and dreamers from around the world who made the desert bloom into a hi-tech superpower. Continuing his message, he related to Israel\u2019s neighbors, saying that \u201cthey failed to appreciate how following Israel\u2019s example could have brought prosperity to the region. Instead, they chose war. They decided to impoverish their people in a futile effort to destroy Israel. They succeeded in the former while failing in the latter.\u201d Why were these words so penetratingly deep? Because they perfectly encapsulate the two sides with precise accuracy \u2013 characterizing Israelis as builders, innovators, creators, wealth makers and those whose legacy will leave behind a better world than the one they found. In contrast to that description, Rubio portrays the other side as having squandered and wasted their resources, choosing to inflict pain, suffering, poverty and a bitter existence for their people as well as those they call their enemy. Ironically, despite all of their concerted energies, they utterly failed at their mission to eradicate the Jewish state which they see as a blight against mankind. It is reflected in their present situation of defeat, shame and a population who, instead of reaping the promised bounty, has been left homeless and beaten down by their own ruthless leadership. https://allisraelnews.com/blog/rubio-gets-it dgsnowdensays:June 11, 2025 at 4:40 PMPerhaps Rubio would be so kind as to offer all those mothers and children \u2018left homeless and beaten down by their own ruthless leadership\u2019 a home.Where should they go?

Israel\u2019s wealth lay not under the ground, but in its people who are exiles, pilgrims and dreamers from around the world who made the desert bloom into a hi-tech superpower. Continuing his message, he related to Israel\u2019s neighbors, saying that \u201cthey failed to appreciate how following Israel\u2019s example could have brought prosperity to the region.

Some timely words by our Secretary of State, who everyday vindicates Trump\u2019s decision to choose him for that role: He stated, \u201cIt took Moses 40 years to find the only place in the Middle East with no oil. Israel\u2019s wealth lay not under the ground, but in its people who are exiles, pilgrims and dreamers from around the world who made the desert bloom into a hi-tech superpower. Continuing his message, he related to Israel\u2019s neighbors, saying that \u201cthey failed to appreciate how following Israel\u2019s example could have brought prosperity to the region. Instead, they chose war. They decided to impoverish their people in a futile effort to destroy Israel. They succeeded in the former while failing in the latter.\u201d Why were these words so penetratingly deep? Because they perfectly encapsulate the two sides with precise accuracy \u2013 characterizing Israelis as builders, innovators, creators, wealth makers and those whose legacy will leave behind a better world than the one they found. In contrast to that description, Rubio portrays the other side as having squandered and wasted their resources, choosing to inflict pain, suffering, poverty and a bitter existence for their people as well as those they call their enemy. Ironically, despite all of their concerted energies, they utterly failed at their mission to eradicate the Jewish state which they see as a blight against mankind. It is reflected in their present situation of defeat, shame and a population who, instead of reaping the promised bounty, has been left homeless and beaten down by their own ruthless leadership. https://allisraelnews.com/blog/rubio-gets-it dgsnowdensays:June 11, 2025 at 4:40 PMPerhaps Rubio would be so kind as to offer all those mothers and children \u2018left homeless and beaten down by their own ruthless leadership\u2019 a home.Where should they go?

Perhaps Hamas would be so kind as not to use the Gazan people as human shields. In the Middle East, peace is very easy to achieve: don\u2019t attack Israel and wage aggressive war against her, and you will have peace. The Arabs have 22 states and virtually all the oil. The Jews have one state on a tiny strip of desert with no oil to speak of. Just leave Israel alone. Very simple. SMH But when your entire population is in the thrall of a genocidal death cult, it makes it more difficult to leave Israel alone. It\u2019s the cult that has to go, then peace will prevail. dgsnowdensays:June 11, 2025 at 5:20 PMSounds like \u2018Hamas\u2019 and Bibi have a lot in common.We could debate who is killing who til the cows come home old man .. . but you didn\u2019t answer the question: what part of Israel has ever belonged to the Palestinians?Where is their home?*it\u2019s a simple question.Loading...Replyokdmanfromkansassays:June 11, 2025 at 5:28 PMBibi and Hamas the same?

Meyersays:June 11, 2025 at 2:58 PMIt seems my message escaped through my fingers, and it might have been at the point where I was talking about world antisemitism. My point was that Israel has all the features of a nation-state, including things the left considers crucial until the discussion is about Israel, when all these criteria disappear.If Israel is considered a made-up nation, so are almost all the nations of the Middle East. However, Israel has a distinct characteristic for its region in the Middle East. Jewish civilization has been time-tested for over 3,000 years. Muslims didn\u2019t start to exist until the birth of Mohammed in 570 AD. I don\u2019t think we want to recreate the borders of all the nations in the aMiddle East, and that is relevant.Loading...Reply It seems my message escaped through my fingers, and it might have been at the point where I was talking about world antisemitism.

We\u2019re just watching biology, tribalism, play out in its modern form. I favor neither \u201cside\u201d in this tiresome dispute. There is, however, one party that I think should be excluded from the US.
