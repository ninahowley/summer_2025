Scott Walker\u2019s claims about economy are accurate, but do not apply to many blacks, Latinos** More on Wisconsin Subscribe to Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker Instagram account Gov. Scott Walker tours Metro Market in Milwaukee on Sept. 13, 2018 to see Kroger and Roundy\u2019s $300 million investment in their 106 Wisconsin stores. In his run for a third term, Walker is touting the strength of Wisconsin\u2019s economy under his tenure. In atweetfrom Sept. 3, Gov. Scott Walker praised Wisconsin\u2019s economy, claiming \u201cwage growth in Wisconsin is higher than the national rate. And the percentage of people working is one of the best in the country.\u201d The Observatory checked both claims by Walker. According to Walker, Wisconsin\u2019s wages are growing faster than the national rate. When asked about the claim, Walker\u2019s campaign press secretary Austin Altenburg referenced a July BizTimesarticle. From January to May of 2018, Wisconsin experienced a year-over-year increase of 5.7 percent, according to the article. The U.S. average was 2.7 percent. Altenburg also sent a link to atweetfrom University of Wisconsin-Madison economics professor Noah Williams, who said Wisconsin\u2019s wages grew 5.9 percent from June 2017 to June 2018. The national average during that time was also 2.7 percent. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, for thefirst quarter of 2018, the average weekly wage in the U.S. increased 3.7 percent, and in Wisconsin the average weekly wage increased 3.8 percent. Because each of these sources looks at a different time frame, the percent increase for Wisconsin and the United States is different. However, no matter the time frame, Wisconsin\u2019s wage growth is beating the national average. While Wisconsin\u2019s wage growth rate is higher than the national rate, the average Wisconsinite is paid less per week than the average American. Nationally, the average weekly wage was $1,152, and in Wisconsin, it was $968, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Moreover,one in fiveWisconsin workers has a poverty-wage job, according to UW-Madison\u2019s COWS, a \u201cnational think-and-do tank that promotes \u2018high road\u2019 solutions to social problems.\u201d COWS defined a poverty-wage job as one that pays less than $11.55 per hour. In Wisconsin, 22 percent of white workers, 41 percent of black workers and 41 percent of Hispanic workers hold poverty-wage jobs. \u201cLow-wage jobs \u2013 indeed, low-wage careers \u2013 define and constrain the prospects of too many workers,\u201d COWS found. \u201cAnd \u2026 while racial inequality is not unique to Wisconsin, it is extreme here.\u201d Despite these caveats, The Observatory rates Walker\u2019s first claim, that the state has experienced higher wage growth than the national average, asVerified. Walker\u2019s second claim was that the percentage of people working in Wisconsin is one of the best in the country. The state has a 69 percent labor force participation rate compared to the national rate of 62.9 percent, according to COWS. This is thefifth highestrate in the country. U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Furthermore, Wisconsin\u2019s current unemployment rate is3 percent\u2014 it\u2019s tied for 10th along with South Dakota and Virginia. The national unemployment rate is 3.9 percent. Wisconsin\u2019s neighbors Minnesota, Iowa, Illinois have an unemployment rate of 2.9, 2.5 and 4.1 percent, respectively. But Wisconsin\u2019s low unemployment rate is not the same for everyone. The 2018 COWS report broke down the state\u2019s unemployment rate by race. COWS found white unemployment was at 2.6 percent, Hispanic unemployment was 5.4 percent and unemployment among African-Americans was 9.3 percent. The black unemployment rate is more than three and a half times the white unemployment rate \u2014 the highest disparity in the nation, COWS associate director Laura Dresser said. \u201cEven as the white unemployment rate is almost the lowest it\u2019s ever been, the black unemployment rate is at levels that we would call a recession,\u201d Dresser said. InApril, The Observatory found that although the state\u2019s unemployment rate was at a historic low, many Wisconsinites have to work two jobs due to low wages. Overall unemployment is low, and labor force participation is high, but that leaves out the context of high unemployment for black residents. As a result, it does not provide a complete picture of Wisconsin\u2019s economy \u2014 especially since the disparity between white and black unemployment is the worst in the nation. Nevertheless, The Observatory rates the claim of Wisconsin\u2019s high overall labor participation asVerified. SourcesTweetfrom Gov.
