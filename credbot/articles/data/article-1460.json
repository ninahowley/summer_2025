This impactful gift was initiated by Christy Worley, VP/Director of Operations at Gabor, who was introduced to Vashti through her friendship with Audrey Copeland, Vashti\u2019s Director of Marketing & Development. Though a more recent supporter, Worley quickly became a raving fan of Vashti\u2019s mission and work. Through the Lincoln Cares program, Gabor employees have the opportunity to nominate a nonprofit organization they are passionate about. Once approved, employee payroll deductions are matched by the company to amplify the impact. Moved by what she saw, Worley nominated Vashti for the vital services it provides to youth and families across Southwest Georgia. \u201cVashti was an easy choice,\u201d said Worley. \u201cThe services they provide in and around Thomasville are critical. I\u2019ve seen firsthand the love, support, and healing they offer to children and families in our community. I\u2019m honored to give back to an organization that gives so much every day.\u201d **Email newsletter signup** Worley and her husband, Kenny, have also taken the opportunity to volunteer with Vashti, supporting various campus and community events. Their hands-on service and heartfelt nomination led to Gabor Financial Solutions matching their generosity in a tangible way\u2014resulting in a total donation of over $7,000 to support Vashti\u2019s mission. \u201cWe\u2019re incredibly grateful to Christy, her family, and the entire Gabor Financial Solutions team,\u201d said Copeland. \u201cThis gift not only supports our mission\u2014it exemplifies how corporate and community partnerships can work hand-in-hand to make lasting change in the lives of vulnerable children. We especially want to thank Kevin Sokolow, President, and Larry Sokolow, CEO, for their leadership in fostering a company culture that empowers employees to give back in such meaningful ways.\u201d Vashti provides residential foster care, after school enrichment, and community-based counseling services to more than 450 children and families annually across Southwest Georgia\u2014serving youth in schools, in their homes, and within the community. The organization also leads the Resilient Communities of Southwest Georgia coalition in partnership with Resilient Georgia and Georgia State University, bringing together regional leaders to promote trauma-informed practices. Additionally, Vashti provides substance misuse prevention and treatment for adolescents through The Seven Challenges\u00ae program, a nationally recognized evidence-based model.
