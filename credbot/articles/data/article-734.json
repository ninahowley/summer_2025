Lagoe, Kelly Dietz, Gary Knox KARE 11 Client Concerns Client Concerns Client Concerns Client Concerns Key Reforms Key Reforms Key Reforms Key Reforms Sounding the Alarm Sounding the Alarm Sounding the Alarm Sounding the Alarm ST PAUL, Minn. Minnesota lawmakers passed major reforms to the state\u2019s Housing Stabilization Services (HSS) program after KARE 11 Investigates uncovered evidence of widespread fraud. The bipartisan legislative changes impose stricter backgrounding and oversight requirements for the program, which is designed to help the elderly and people with disabilities find and maintain housing. The HSS program is funded through Medicaid and overseen by the Minnesota Department of Human Services (DHS). In 2024, state data details HSS cost close to $105 million. But KARE 11 discovered significant allegations of fraud and forgery within the taxpayer-funded program, and providers billing the state for services clients say were never delivered. Legislators said the recent changes were directly inspired by aseries of KARE 11 reports. **:Client Concerns** Jesse Kingbird is a disabled combat veteran who is currently homeless. Earlier this year, he applied for HSS assistance but was denied by DHS, which told him he was already enrolled with another provider\u2014someone he had never heard of. \u201cI said, \u2018From who?\u2019\u201d Kingbird recalled. \u201cLike, I have no idea who these people are. I never heard these names before.\u201d Kingbird says the electronic signature on the form signing him up for HSS was forged. It\u2019s a pattern echoed by others across Minnesota. Another client, Steven Smith, says his signature signing him upfor services by a different company was also forged. Smith\u2019s HSS provider, who billed for allegedly helping him find and maintain housing, is Leo Human Services. The company billed more than $1.2 million to Medicaid in 2024\u2014 earning its spot in the state\u2019s top 10 billers. \u201cI\u2019ve never got an hour of help,\u201d Smith said. KARE 11 extracted metadata from the PDF document that revealed that Smith\u2019s signature, dated 08/28/23, was actually created the following day, 08/29/23, and authored by someone named Wats Hanin. DHS rules are clearthat providers are not permitted to sign on behalf of the recipient. Other HSS clients told KARE 11,taxpayers footed the bill for services never provided.Rachel Lien, who signed up for services with Brilliant Minds after completing addiction recovery treatment, provided records to prove it. \u201cEverything listed is a complete lie,\" Lien said, while reading through her records. At KARE 11\u2019s request, Lien obtained documentation from Brilliant Minds of the services they provided. In one example, Brilliant Minds documented a meeting with Rachel, stating: \u201cI met with Rachel and introduced myself to her and spent a quality amount of time getting to know one another.\" But Rachel\u2019s treatment records confirm Rachel was in a group counseling session at the exact same time Brilliant Minds claimed to have met with her. **:Key Reforms** \u201cWe\u2019re going to slap a lid on it\u201d said DFL State Senator John Hoffman about the fraud allegations within HSS. \u201cThose bad actors, we need to stop.\u201d He told KARE 11, the Special Legislative session allowed him and GOP Senator Jim Abeler to work on bipartisan reforms \u2013 completely rewriting state statute on how HSS is delivered. Changes are as follows: Limitations on billing, now capped at 100 hours annually per client Limitations on billing, now capped at 100 hours annually per client Limitations on billing, now capped at 100 hours annually per client Providers can utilize remote support for no more than 20% of transition and sustaining services for the recipient.

She told KARE 11 it\u2019s \u201ctoo easy\u201d for HSS companies to commit fraud. A report from the housing advocacy group Hearth Connection, submitted to DHS in August 2024, warned that \u201creports of predatory activity to enroll individuals without their knowledge are increasing.\u201d It also described predatory enrollers trolling outside emergency shelters, approaching people, promising housing and misrepresenting what they offer participants. Multiple addiction treatment providers interviewed by KARE 11 described aggressive marketing at their centers by HSS providers. The legislative reforms mark progress\u2014but investigations are ongoing. In May, DHS notified KARE 11 of investigations into Leo Human Services, Brilliant Minds and several other HSS companies spotlighted by KARE 11. DHS also vowed to exercise its discretion to heighten oversight of all HSS companies as of June 1, by increasing the provider screening risk level from \"limited\" to \"high\" risk. KARE 11 later learned DHS has cut off Medicaid payments to both Leo Human Services and Brilliant Minds. As for Kingbird, he wants more than policy change. \u201cThis is not a victimless crime,\u201d he said. \u201cThey need to be hauled off to jail. There are no ifs, ands, or buts about that.\u201d KARE 11\u2019s investigation into Housing Stabilization Services and questionable billing practices continues.
