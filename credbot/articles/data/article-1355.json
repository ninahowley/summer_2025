David also discusses how Trump\u2019s feud with Elon Musk reveals a deeper truth about power in the postdemocracy Republican Party. Then David is joined by Arizona Senator Ruben Gallego to discuss how Democrats can win the votes of young men, the importance of free trade and patriotism in today\u2019s Democratic Party, and how Gallego has been so successful with Latino voters at a time when Latino men are trending so strongly Republican. The following is a transcript of the episode: David Frum:Hello, and welcome to another episode ofThe David Frum Show. I\u2019m David Frum, a staff writer atThe Atlantic. My guest this week is Senator Ruben Gallego from Arizona, one of the rising stars of the Democratic Party. I recorded my interview with Senator Gallego on June 5, and at that time, I also recorded a monologue talking about the White House farce, tragedy, conflict between Elon Musk and Donald Trump\u2014Elon Musk being the richest man in the world, the biggest contributor to the Trump campaign, the de facto chief of staff and vice president to Donald Trump; and Donald Trump, the president of the United States. But one of the lessons of the Trump years is: It never pays to do things early. You always want to leave things to the last minute because however outrageous the big story on Thursday is, there may be something that happens on the weekend that is even bigger. And so it is. So we\u2019re topping that topper with another topper. Over the weekend, there was an outbreak of unruly protest, disorderly protest, and even violent protest in Los Angeles against immigration raids by the Trump administration. I\u2019m at some distance; I wasn\u2019t an eyewitness. I\u2019m relying on news reports, and there\u2019s some uncertainty about exactly what happened, but it looks like rocks were thrown at ICE vehicles. Protesters tried to impede ICE officers doing their duty. Fireworks were shot off. A car seems to have been set on fire. Now, all of this is illegal, disorderly, and must, of course, be met by the force of law. Fortunately, there are nearly 9,000 officers of the Los Angeles Police Department, uniformed officers with the right to arrest. And the state of California\u2014in cities and counties and at the state level\u2014deploys, altogether, more than 75,000 uniformed officers with arrest powers. So given the state of the situation, there looked to be nothing that the state of California couldn\u2019t cope with on its own. Mercifully, at the time I record today, there were no reports of any injury to any law-enforcement personnel, which, if correct, gives you some idea of the disorderly and upsetting, but genuinely limited, nature of the lawbreaking on hand. Nevertheless, President Trump announced an intent to federalize California\u2019s National Guard and send 2,000 military personnel into the state, and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth chimed in with an offer of sending actual Marines from bases in California. Now, this is being reported as, in some ways, an immigration story, but it\u2019s really much, much more than that. By the way, as it happened, it looks like the National Guard was never sent (or certainly wasn\u2019t sent in time), and the Marines also weren\u2019t sent. I think a way to think about what happened in California this weekend is as a trial run, a test, a practice for things that Donald Trump has in mind in 2026. Observers of the Trump administration have noted a strange paradox. On the one hand, Donald Trump is doing one after another outrageous act of seeming violation of rules, seeming illegality, selling billions of dollars of coins to persons unknown, accepting foreign jets\u2014things that, if he loses the protection of control of the House of Representatives and the Senate in 2026, portend a world of trouble and even legal jeopardy for him in the second two years of his administration. And yet, facing that danger, Donald Trump has blithely done one thing after another that seems guaranteed to lose him at least the House, and maybe both House and Senate, in 2026: the tariffs, this tax bill that offers very little to ordinary people, the economy slowly being ground into recession under the burden of all of his restrictive actions. I mean, to do tariffs and an immigration crackdown at the same time is really asking for an economic slowdown. So how do you make sense of this? Does Donald Trump not know that the elections are coming? Does he not sense the danger that he\u2019s in, of what will happen to him, of what could happen to him should his party lose its ability to protect him in House and Senate? Well, I think the answer is: Donald Trumpdoesknow, and he does have a scheme to protect himself, but it\u2019s not doing popular things to keep his majorities in Congress. It\u2019s looking for ways to subvert the 2026 elections to prevent them from happening, or at least to control them so they don\u2019t threaten him at all. Now, we have had some inklings of Donald Trump\u2019s thinking along these lines. We saw them in 2020, when people close to Donald Trump\u2014like his former national security adviser Michael Flynn\u2014advised him to use the military to suppress the 2020 vote. But Flynn\u2019s advice in 2020 came too late. The election had already happened. Flynn was looking to overturn an election in the past, not to prevent an election in the future. And that\u2019s a big thing to do, especially when court after court after court has ruled that the president and his supporters\u2019 claims against the 2020 election were utterly meritless. Also, Donald Trump in 2020 had a military around him that was not likely to obey illegal orders. Under Secretary of Defense [Mark] Esper and under chairman of the Joint Chiefs Mark Milley, the Defense Department had said,Look\u2014we will follow any lawful order of the president. But when the president suggests shooting protesters\u2014as he did during the George Floyd riots\u2014we\u2019re going say, \u201cMr. President, are you quite sure? I\u2019m not gonna take a hint here. I need an order, and I need it maybe in writing, so that when I am court-martialed, I can show, \u2018The president told me to shoot those people.\u2019\u201dAnd Donald Trump always backed down because he couldn\u2019t rely on Esper and Milley to take the hint about what he wanted done. But here\u2019s how his mind worked. We saw this in 2018. In October 2018, as Donald Trump was heading toward midterm elections that would cost him his majority in the House of Representatives, he began to get very upset about an immigration caravan that was supposedly\u2014a so-called caravan that was\u2014heading toward the border. And he began talking in October 2018 about needing a state of emergency to do something about this, to freeze the border, to militarize the southern states. Now, that didn\u2019t go very far. In the first term, Trump\u2019s talk was often much more radical than Trump\u2019s actions. But you could see the way his mind was going. The president has very broad and quite messy emergency powers. He can do a lot of different things by invoking a state of emergency. He thought about it in 2018. He thought about it in 2020. He wasn\u2019t able to do it either time. But in 2026, he\u2019s going to have a very different kind of administration around him. He\u2019s got a former talk-show host as a secretary of defense, one with a long list of allegations of heavy drinking and allegations of sexual abuse against him, who\u2019s completely beholden to Donald Trump. There are similarly beholden people running the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI. There\u2019s a striking lack of independent voices of people with substantial reputations and long-proven integrity\u2014and, for that matter, proven loyalty to the law of the United States. He\u2019s got the administration of his dreams, and he\u2019s got the problem of a lifetime: the risk of losing the House of Representatives. So what\u2019s the plan? The state of emergency. And that was tested in California. Now, how would this work? Theoretically, of course. We don\u2019t know any of this. I\u2019m just telling you how a criminally minded person might advise the president. The president doesn\u2019t have a button he can press to stop elections. Elections are administered by the states. But what the president can do is put pressure on certain states, or delay or stop elections in certain states in order to convene the House of Representatives, which will be full of newly elected people from his states and vacancies from the other states. There\u2019s some precedent for this. In 2018, the island of Saipan, which is a U.S. territory, was hit by a devastating typhoon, and the governor of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands issued a series of emergency declarations\u2014he\u2019s acting under federal executive power; it\u2019s not a state\u2014including ordering postponing elections that were to be held in the territory for two weeks, including an election to the U.S. House of Representatives, where the Northern Marianas have a nonvoting delegate. No one questioned this. It\u2019s a genuine typhoon, and things really were terribly, terribly disrupted. And two weeks is not so long to wait for the right to vote in the face of a genuine emergency. But that was a proof of the power to delay an election that could be wielded by a functionary of the executive branch. Back during Reconstruction, the Grant administration often sent federal troops into areas where there was Ku Klux Klan activity to postpone elections, reorganize elections, redo elections. Again, that was Reconstruction; they were facing terroristic violence that was threatening the rights of, in South Carolina, half the population of the state. But there are precedents here. Now, imagine this in 2026. President Trump provokes some kind of outbreak in California or in some other blue state. He declares a state of emergency. He sends the National Guard. And he says elections have to be postponed until order is restored. That may be weeks; it may be months. In the meantime, there are no representatives from California in the U.S. House of Representatives. With missing blue-state representatives, the red-state people will continue their majority, even though they would likely lose it in a free and fair election in 2026. I\u2019m not saying this is something thatwillhappen, but it\u2019s something thatcouldhappen, and I think it was something we just saw tested. So I think as President Trump\u2019s mind wanders into places where no president\u2019s mind has ever wandered before, it\u2019s going to fall upon all of us to let our minds follow afterwards\u2014to listen to the hints, to listen to things that sound crazy, to listen topeoplewho sound crazy, because they may be the prophets of what\u2019s to come. And now some thoughts on the Elon Musk\u2013Donald Trump dispute, and then my interview with Senator Ruben Gallego. [Music] Frum:Everyone\u2019s talking about this. It\u2019s hard to think of anything additional to say beyond what\u2019s been said. But there\u2019s a point that I\u2019d like to flag that I think has not gone discussed enough, which is: It\u2019s kind of insulting and kind of dangerous that American citizens have to care about this kind of personal dispute at the highest levels of government. The question of whose side you\u2019re on in this kind of personality spat is not something you expect to see in a rule-of-law government. In an authoritarian regime, for sure. Presidents and secret-police chiefs fall out, and one will assassinate the other, send the other to prison. There will be coups and countercoups. But in a democratic rule-of-law system of government, personality is supposed to count not for nothing, but for a lot less. These are all functionaries. These are all servants of the people, highly replaceable. And when they dispute, historically, we expect their disputes to reflect something other than their mere selfish-ego needs. For example, at the beginning of the Biden administration, there was a big dispute between former Secretary of the Treasury Larry Summers, one of the most important outside advisers of the Biden administration, and many of the economic insiders in the Biden administration. Summers warned that the spending plans of the Biden administration were probably too big for the needs of the economy and were likely to generate inflation. As it happened, he was right, but that\u2019s not the point. Others in the Biden administration said,No, we made a mistake in the Obama administration, not spending enough before we were out of the woods. And anyway, this is an opportunity to get done a lot of things that we and the Democratic Party think are important. So we want to proceed with these spending plans, even at the risk of inflation. And there was a big dispute about that. As I said, Summers was right, but that was hard to know in advance. The other people were certainly motivated by sincere concerns for their vision of the public good. And sometimes it got a little testy, and some personality issues did flare up, and people made ad hominem arguments, as they will. But what everyone understood was: This is not an argument about Summers trying to dominate the insiders, and the insiders trying to dominate Summers. They were talking about something important to the public well-being: How big should the Biden post-COVID recovery plans be? How much money should be spent? How much debt should be incurred? This was something that honest and intelligent people could have meaningful, impersonal disagreements about, even if, as I said, ego gets attached, tempers flare, and the unfortunate things are said. That\u2019s the way it\u2019s supposed to be. And you can find examples of this in many other administrations. Hawks during the Cold War days\u2014there were always disputes between the hawks and the doves, between those who wanted to have a more forward policy toward the Soviet Union and those who wanted to try harder on detente, those who were more optimistic about China and those who were less optimistic. And always the question of: Where does the government spend its money? How? On what? All of these things cause tensions and disputes. And you\u2019ll find them in back issues of old periodicals about the events of the day. But the theory was, and the practice usually was, that the issues drove the personalities, not the personalities drove the issues. It was not a question of personalities in dispute looking for reasons, looking for weapons to use against each other in the form of issues. It was a dispute about real issues: Should the government spend more after COVID? Should it spend less? How real is the risk of inflation in 2021, versus how real is the risk of persistent long-term unemployment? That\u2019s the way it\u2019s supposed to be. What\u2019s going on between Trump and Elon Musk is like something out of (you\u2019d read it in the pages of) Tacitus in the Roman empire, something out of postcolonial states, something you\u2019d see in the Soviet Union when the secret police would dispute with the army. This is about egos and imperatives, about two people who see themselves as independent of anybody else and as principals, not as servants of the public. It\u2019s a question of personalist government. I mean, think how weird and anomalous and really sinister the position of Elon Musk was. Elon Musk was the head of a government department. Now, formally, other people were named as the head of this DOGE\u2014whatever, the Department of Government Efficiency\u2014but Musk was given status as a special government employee. Everyone could see he was in charge. He hired other outside people and brought them in. All of this at the same time as he was one of the government\u2019s largest contractors, and at the same time as he was an independent businessman who had not divested any of his companies. Normally, if you\u2019re a business leader and you go into government, you have to sever yourself from your business interests to avoid conflict-of-interest rules, which are not just opinions in the government but are actually backed by the force of law, or used to be\u2014that if someone in government employ uses his power or her power to do something that advantages his business interests or hers, or to disadvantage a competitor or hers, that\u2019s against the law. And there are a variety of statutes that can catch you up. Musk every day was ignoring all of those practices and rules and legislation, some of them backed by the force of criminal sanction. And the people who he brought into government, again, they often had outside interests or had past concerns that would\u2019ve subjected them to conflict-of-interest rules. All of that, ignored. They imposed big cuts in important areas of government\u2014not just the tragedy of cutting the HIV program in Africa, PEPFAR, that saved tens of millions of lives since it was initiated by President George W. Bush, but Securities and Exchange Commission, Internal Revenue Service. Agencies that directly bore on the active business interests of Donald Trump and Elon Musk, these were shut down by Elon Musk. And maybe all those IRS employees who were in charge of auditing high-income individuals, maybe those SEC people who were dealing with allegations of SEC issues involving Musk, maybe they were all irrelevant and unnecessary and redundant and overstaffed. Or maybe they were just in the way, and somebody used personal power to get rid of them\u2014personal power that was converted into state power to get rid of them. Now, Musk is not activated just by self-interest. He does have these weird ideological ticks that seem to be getting weirder. And those have been part of what has driven the United States government too. The United States is turning away refugees from everywhere, including people who serve the United States and Afghanistan, and it\u2019s rolling out a red carpet for white Afrikaner farmers. I don\u2019t know\u2014maybe they\u2019ve got a claim. I\u2019m not hostile to the white Afrikaner farmers. But it is strange that there\u2019s a locked door for everybody else and a red carpet for the people with whom Elon Musk identifies, as his family originally comes from South Africa. Again, this is a question of using state power for personal ends. Look\u2014the statement that is supposed to define the United States government is that it\u2019s a government of laws, not men. The rules and regulations, the government is always supposed to be more powerful, more enduring, more important than the people who work in it. And the people there are there to serve. But that idea really does seem to be jettisoned\u2014not just abandoned, but actively jettisoned, repudiated\u2014in the Trump years. And this dispute exemplifies it. Musk\u2019s particular criticisms of Trump\u2019s so-called big\u2014what do you [call it]? Big, bouncing baby boy\u2014whatever he calls that bill. Musk\u2019s may well be valid. The billisirresponsible; it does add a lot of money to the debts and deficits in the out years. There\u2019s a kind of card trick going on here, where, in 2017, when Trump passed his first tax cut or the tax cut of the first administration, the only reason it met the deficit-and-debt rules that it had to be passed under was by saying it would expire in 2025. Now that it is expiring in 2025, the Trump people say,Well, it doesn\u2019t really cost anything, because we\u2019re largely extending tax cuts that were passed in 2017. Yeah. But in 2017, you said they would expire, and that\u2019s why they had one price. If theydon\u2019texpire, they have a different price, and you\u2019re engaged in a kind of hustle. And so Musk\u2019s criticisms of this, they may well be true. But he\u2019s not criticizing because he\u2019s motivated by a disinterested concern for the public finances. Remember how his interests were exempted from all the budget cuts that were imposed on other people. He\u2019s mad at Trump for his own reasons, and so he\u2019s using a weapon at hand. In his case, at least one of the things he\u2019s reaching for is true. The others\u2014accusing Trump of being in the Epstein files\u2014those may be more far-fetched. But he\u2019s reaching for everything he can get\u2014but not because he cares about these issues, but because he\u2019s asserting his own ego to punish someone he\u2019s mad at. And Trump is doing the same. Trump is threatening to withdraw government business from Elon Musk\u2019s companies. And, again, look\u2014there\u2019s a strong case that Starlink and SpaceX should not be in private hands, the United States government should take them over. These are essential to national security. And if it\u2019s true that Elon Musk turned off Starlink to disadvantage the Ukrainians, he was using his corporate power for personal, ideological, or other interests at the expense of the public welfare. So that has to be dealt with. But Donald Trump, again, is not motivated by impersonal concern for the public welfare. He\u2019s punishing an opponent. And so suddenly, conflict-of-interest rules that didn\u2019t interest him 15 minutes ago are suddenly the order of the day. We are having a breakdown of the rule-of-law system in the United States. I\u2019ve often worried that you could have a Trump administration, or you could have the rule of law in the United States, but not both. You could have Elon Musk in government, or you could have government be pure of conflicts of interest, but not both. The law is the victim of both these men. And both of them need to be run out of town as fast as possible, after which, let the law take its course. And now my conversation with Senator Ruben Gallego. But first, a quick break. [Music] Frum:The story of Senator Ruben Gallego is both an amazing story of personal achievement and also a classic American narrative of what this country can deliver. A son of immigrants in this country from Latin America, Ruben Gallego grew up in Chicago in a single-parent home. He joined the Marine Corps while still an undergraduate at Harvard. He served in combat in Iraq in a unit fiercely engaged with the insurgency. He settled in Arizona after his military service, was elected to the state assembly as a Democrat, then defied the red wave of 2014 to win election to the U.S. House of Representatives in that difficult year. Here\u2019s where the high political drama begins. In 2018, Arizona Democrats elected Kyrsten Sinema to the U.S. Senate. In office, Sinema became alienated from her party and ultimately declared herself an independent. Congressman Gallego emerged as the leading challenger to Sinema\u2019s reelection. She decided not to run again, rather than face him. He then faced the ultra-Trumpy election denier Kari Lake in the general election of 2024, and beat her too. Along the way, Gallego\u2019s own image as a fighting progressive has shifted toward the political center. He\u2019s now regarded by many Democrats as one of their brightest future stars, and it\u2019s a pleasure and honor to welcome him toThe David Frum Show. Senator, thank you for joining us today. Ruben Gallego:Gracias, David. Frum:I\u2019m speaking to you from about as deep inside the beltway as you can get\u2014like, almost the buckle of the beltway. And some of our viewers may share that same condition with me. So just to enlighten all of us, when you said your constituents want a \u201cbig-ass truck,\u201d how big-ass is the truck they want? Gallego:(Laughs.) Well, big enough for them to feel like they\u2019ve succeeded in life. And I think that\u2019s, basically, what I\u2019m trying to say. And when I joked about it, it really is somewhat true. Like, if you grow up, like I did, in a working-class Latino family, your measure of success was what people would consider artificial, but is actually real. It\u2019s the real, tangible things: Buying a home, being able to get a nice truck that is responsive to the fact that you worked hard for this, and you took a lot of pride in that truck. You wash that truck on the driveway every weekend, with your kids. And when we can\u2019t deliver that as a party\u2014me and Democrats as a party\u2014if these men feel that we\u2019re not able to get them that future that can allow them to buy that \u201cbig-ass truck,\u201d or take that vacation, or feel a little more comfortable, or buy that house, or start that business, then we\u2019re going to lose their votes. Frum:Well, let me ask you about that lesson. So I was going through the leadership of both parties, House and Senate, and I\u2019m struck that leader after leader comes from about as safe a state as you can get: South Dakota; Wyoming; or New York, New York. And that\u2019s true, by the way, with the executive branch too. Donald Trump used to be a New Yorker, but he became a Floridian to run again in 2024. J. D. Vance comes from what used to be a swing state, Ohio\u2014not a swing state anymore. You\u2019re one of the very few people who\u2019s in the national conversation who comes from a highly competitive state, possibly even the most competitive state. So as someone who\u2019s won elections in a competitive state, what lessons do you think you have for the people who are looking at politics from the safety of the sidelines? Gallego:Well, I think one of the things that you could give the credit to, really, me and Mark Kelly, for example, my senior senator, is that we don\u2019t have the luxury of being in anything safe. And one of the benefits about Arizona, too, is that there is no real bubble in Arizona. I guess you could be in a political bubble if you want, but, you know, Democrats and Republicans live next to each other. They\u2019re still friends. They still hang out. They still work together. This is why you saw so many Gallego-Trump voters, right? Because these are the people that can make these nuanced separations of who they want, who they think best represents them. And it also means that you can\u2019t avoid what is going on or what people\u2019s fears are. You know, one of the things that I think was very instructive for us\u2014at least, like, just generally for my campaign\u2014is that one of the things that that helped us is that we were very realistic about what was happening out there, what people were feeling. And while everyone was trying to say that the economy was getting better\u2014because I think I\u2019m in a competitive state, and, generally, I don\u2019t really live in an uppity area; I live in a working-class area in South Phoenix; I really get to touch real grass all the time\u2014and I heard it from people at the grocery store, at the gas stations that they were just having a tough time making ends meet. And this isn\u2019t 2022 when I\u2019m hearing this. I\u2019m hearing this in early 2024. I\u2019m hearing the sense of desperation that they\u2019re just working so hard, and they\u2019re just not getting anywhere. Or these young men and women that are looking at the world that they don\u2019t understand anymore, because, you know, for Arizona, four years ago, if you had a family making middle-class, middle-income salary, you could afford a house. Now the average house in Arizona is about $530,000. And good luck, you know, finding that house; it\u2019s probably far out in the middle of nowhere and, on average, a 7.5 percent mortgage. And so we talked to the voter about what they wanted to hear and talk about and what they were worried about. When everyone was trying to deny that there was a problem at the border, every Democrat was trying to deny the problem at the border, we knew that that was just not the case. And people were still talking about the border. They were worried about it, and they were mad at Democrats for allowing this chaos to happen. Instead of running away from it, we ran right to the fight and brought the arguments about why we were better than our opponent on these issues. And I think that ended up being one of the saving graces, why we\u2019re able to outperform really all Senate Democrats in the country, considering, especially, that Arizona does have about 300,000 more registered Republicans than Democrats. We have no choice as candidates\u2014me, Mark Kelly, other statewide candidates\u2014to make sure that we are actually figuring out a way to win in a bipartisan manner, by keeping our values also as Democrats but also delivering to Arizona. We have no choice. We have to do it. Frum:One of the things I noticed about Democrats from sort of the safer areas is: They attach a lot of importance to words, and often more importance to words rather than to things. And I\u2019m struck here\u2014 Gallego:Or deeds, yeah. Frum:There\u2019s been a project to evaluate why Democrats are doing poorly with men. And when you read the discussion about it, it\u2019s all about changing the way we speak, changing the way we frame things. The idea that there might actually be something of substance that is the problem, that\u2019s not something that seems to be very acceptable. Now, you don\u2019t have that luxury. Gallego:I don\u2019t have the luxury. But also, it\u2019s like you don\u2019t\u2014the Democrats are all about data until they don\u2019t like the data. The data for men is: They\u2019re just not doing well. This is not just Black men, Latino men. This is all men, right? We have the lowest amount of college attainment. Salaries are going down. Life expectancies are going down. There\u2019s just this general discontent within the male population. If you just look at the data, you would say,Hey\u2014this population of the United States is not doing well. We should figure out what to do about it. Let\u2019s have conversations. Let\u2019s have town halls. Let\u2019s have real studies about this. And what you see, and what I\u2019ve seen in the past, is there\u2019s this\u2014I try not to exaggerate how sometimes the Democrats can be anti-male, but there is a certain amount of that that does happen. When you start talking about it, people are saying, like,Oh, you\u2019re concentrating on males and forgetting X, Y, Z population,which I don\u2019t think is the case. I think we care about Americans. We should care about all Americans. And if men aren\u2019t doing well, us as a party who are supposed to care for the people that are not doing well, we should do something about it. And we could do, at the same time, making sure we\u2019re protecting women\u2019s rights, making sure that women are also at the forefront of everything, that we\u2019re protecting the LBGTQ community, all these kinds of things, right? But the fact is, for some reason, Democrats have gotten sheepish about this. You know, there\u2019s people that are involved in different types of think tanks about the status of men and boys, and they\u2019re largely frozen out of the conversations around Democratic policy making, because what we want is: We want the male vote, but we want it cheaply. We want the male vote to come to us without us getting some other interest groups pissed off. And we also want the male vote to come with us, and we want it to be within our safe little tent of ideas and ideology, and we want them to be perfectly fine to fit with all of our other friends. Which, guess what? That\u2019s just not how we\u2019re going to win. We\u2019re going to have to accept that some of these male voters are not going to be aligned with certain sectors of our tent if we want to win. If we don\u2019t want to win, then fine. Accept that we\u2019re going to be a small tent, and hopefully we win once in a while. But in reality: The Democrats want the male vote without actually having to work the male vote. And they think they can just throw a bunch of dudes on podcasts and, you know, bro it up, and that\u2019s somehow going to solve the problem. It\u2019s not going to solve the problem. Frum:One thing that has been attended in the Trump years\u2014and you can say this is actually a good thing about America, and maybe even one of Donald Trump\u2019s few positive legacies\u2014is the American melting pot does continue to bubble along. You can see it as early as the 2010s, but you can really see it happening in the 2020s, that we are seeing a big decrease in race and ethnic polarization in the United States. But we\u2019re paying for it by having this big increase in sex polarization. So men are men. Women are women. Wherever they come from, whatever the color of their skin, the women are voting more like each other; the men are voting more like each other. So the melting pot is bubbling, but the wall of separation between the sexes seems to be getting higher and higher. Gallego:Yeah, a hundred percent. And look\u2014some of it is COVID-induced. Some of it is: They\u2019re listening to different things. One of the things we knew instinctively, because growing up Latino and working class: Latino men do not intently watch Univision, Telemundo. They don\u2019t intently follow politics. They largely are disconnected from the normal avenues of\u2014well, I would say that normal people kind of consume news and political news. And one of the things that I emphasized on my campaign early on is a nontraditional way to reach these men, because you\u2019ve got to understand the way these guys are. I mean, when I was in construction, I would wake up at 6 a.m., go to the site. Hopefully, it\u2019d be done by 3 p.m. but probably not. So maybe you\u2019re back at home by 5 p.m. You\u2019re dirty as hell. You\u2019re smelly as hell. You\u2019re jumping in the shower, and then maybe, you know, you\u2019re in time\u2014you\u2019ve made it home in time for dinner, right? You\u2019re sitting down to dinner, and then you have probably a couple hours before you zonk out to start the next day. Do you want to spend that time watching the news? Do you want to spend that time talking politics? No. You want to spend time with your family or with your friends, because your day sucked, and it\u2019s going to suck again tomorrow. And so you do this rinse and repeat, rinse and repeat. So where are they getting all their information from? Well, a couple places. Number one, they\u2019re getting it from their other coworkers at worksites\u2014which by the way, people forget when it comes to Latino men, the people they\u2019re most likely to work with besides other Latino men are white working-class men, right? And white working-class men are very much politically involved and have a lot of political information that they\u2019re getting. And they\u2019re sharing it with their Latino coworkers, right? And number two, they\u2019re living off their phones through different social media, whether it\u2019s Instagram, Snapchat, or all this kind of stuff, Twitter. So one of the things that we emphasize is trying to figure out how to get a message, a vibe, about who I was to these Latino male voters early on, so that way they understood, like,Ruben Gallego is a Democrat. Ruben Gallego says he\u2019s for the working class. But then we also had a very strong cultural attachment. Like,He understands me. He actually worked at factories, worked in construction, understands the dignity of work, the responsibility of a man to his family, to provide for his family, and how important that is to me as a man. And that kind of stuff, we are afraid to approach to get these men to start considering us as Democrats. And then, because we never talk about it, we never give them the dignity of allowing them to be family leaders and not making them feel bad about being family leaders. And then we\u2019re surprised when, year after year, we don\u2019t continue to have this conversation with us, they keep on moving away from us. And it\u2019s a dumb trade-off, because we continue to do that because we think that somehow we\u2019re going to piss off female voters. And I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case. Female voters are worried about their sons or daughters and their husbands. They\u2019re worried about the fact that they\u2019re becoming less social. They\u2019re worried about the fact that they\u2019re not actually being productive in life. And they want to have good husbands\u2014heck, they want to have goodex-husbands that are involved with their kids\u2019 lives, and they\u2019re making good pay and paying their child support, things of that nature. But for some reason, the Democrats have continued this trade-off, and it\u2019s going to continue going until we realize: Making sure [of] people\u2019s economic needs will cross all racial barriers and, if you do it rightly, will also cross these gender gaps that we\u2019re seeing. Frum:Well, let me ask you: You\u2019re famous for having banned the use of the termLatinxfrom any communication you do. But let me ask you about a term you\u2019ve been using:Latino. You\u2019re originally from Chicago. If someone practiced politics in Chicago 100 years ago and someone said there\u2019s this thing called an Eastern Europeano\u2014Croat, Serbs, they\u2019re the same; Poles, Ukrainians are the same; everybody loves the Ashkenazi Jews\u2014it\u2019s just one thing. Gallego:I think if Chicago, like\u2014if you weren\u2019t Irish or Scottish or Polish, you were Bohemian. That\u2019s the way they would describe any European that they couldn\u2019t describe. Yeah. And then me, growing up, you were Spanish or Mexican, if you were lucky, or Puerto Rican. Frum:But let me ask you this: Is this concept of Latino helping anybody understand anything at all? And as particularly the Democratic Party, that a lot of Democratic Party politics has been driven over the past quarter century by the idea,Okay, there\u2019s this new minority. They all come from the same continent and half a continent\u2014because Mexico, of course, is in North America\u2014and most of them speak Spanish, some speak Portuguese, some speak indigenous languages. But we\u2019re going to group them into a thing, and we\u2019re just going to assume we own them, and they\u2019re going to naturally gravitate to voting for us. They\u2019re going to be in opposition to the standard organization of American society, and they\u2019re going to want minority set-asides. And that\u2019s the way to talk to them. And the very invention of the concept of Latino has been a disabling\u2014part of your family comes from Colombia; part of your family comes from Mexico. Those are very different historical experiences. Gallego:Oh, hell yeah. Frum:And with Eastern Europeans, we would understand if your father was Serbian and your mother was Croat, that didn\u2019t make you an Eastern Europeano; that made you a person with two different heritages that you had to balance. Gallego:I think the mistake that happened, it\u2019s like the names don\u2019t matter so much. Now go back to whyLatinxmatters versusLatino: What happened within the progressive left, as well as the Democratic Party, is that you had all these Latinos that kept voting Democratic, right? Yeah, no matter what. And the difference was two things. Number one: There was discrimination against Latinos. I mean, you saw signs going into the 1970s, you know, no spics, no dogs allowed. In the Southwest, there was housing discrimination, there was educational discrimination. And of course, that drove those voters to the Democratic Party, because we were the only party, really, that was outright for equality. The level of income attainment was extremely low. So the Latino population on average was poorer than the Anglo population. And the Democrats were the party of the middle class, a working class of: Who\u2019s going to protect your rights? Who\u2019s going to protect your wages? Who\u2019s going to give you an opportunity to go to a good school and live the American dream? That was the Democratic Party. What happened is: the Democratic Party kind of kept on evolving, and the Latino population kept growing bigger and bigger. The Latino population changed\u2014and I don\u2019t mean change, as in there was new populations that came in, except for the Cubans; that\u2019s another tangent and a weird story there. But we got bigger, and we also got richer within our population. And even though, on average, Latinos are poorer, we have a lot of great success stories in America, right? If you look at the police forces in a lot of our big cities, you have a lot of Latino police forces. You have a lot of Latino firemen. So there\u2019s been this\u2014and this is a good story, by the way. This is a good story. This is what you want to happen to your immigrant communities, right? This is the story of the American dream. We are moving up to middle class; we\u2019re moving everything else. And so the Democratic Party just never changed as the Latino population was changing, right? And if anything, it actually went further away from what they were, right? Focusing more on social issues and not so much on the economic issues that we were known for. And then also, just adopting things that the Latino community would naturally be against, right? Open borders, for example, was something that if you had Latino friends, they would\u2019ve told you,Well, that\u2019s dumb. Like, why? Why would you do that?Kind of the anti-police rhetoric. We live in neighborhoods where we want police to treat us well but also to be present, and this anti-police rhetoric that took off for many years affects them, especially, again, when we have so many people that are in the military\u2014sorry, in the police force. And this kind of moving away from this idea of patriotism being a core value of the Democratic Party and understanding that America is an exceptional country and we should pride and value that, it goes against the grain of what Latinos know, right? Our kids serve in the military. We actually come here because we think it\u2019s an exceptional country. And when Arizona\u2014sorry, when Democrats are sheepish about talking about the country in that way, it does an impact. Frum:Well, let me ask you about the military. So you were in Iraq. You served with a unit that took a lot of casualties. You saw some hard things. Some of the people in your cohort who returned from Iraq, like the serving vice president, have been radicalized and embittered\u2014or so they say that\u2019s why they\u2019ve been radicalized and embittered. He wasn\u2019t radicalized and embittered. I knew him when he immediately came back from Iraq, and he wasn\u2019t radicalized and embittered then, but the farther the experience recedes, the more embittered he becomes about it. Other people who have served in the post-9/11 wars\u2014like your former House colleague Dan Crenshaw, like some of your Senate colleagues, Tammy Duckworth\u2014they retain their faith in America\u2019s purposes in the world, that American military power is a necessary thing and a force for good. How do you process your military experience, and how does it affect the way you think about America\u2019s role in the world and America\u2019s military in the world? Gallego:Yeah, I mean, for me, it\u2019s pretty interesting just because, I mean, the vice president and I were actually in Iraq at the same time. He was serving on a base called Al Asad, and I was a frontline infantry unit that was never on base. And actually, my unit was from Ohio, so the Reserve unit I served with, Lima 3/25. And as you know, we ended up, unfortunately, seeing a lot of combat and lost a lot of men. And I actually did come back embittered. I came back embittered at the administration for sending me to a bogus war to begin with. And they sent me to a bogus war without the equipment that I needed, that got a lot of my men killed\u2014and the manpower, by the way, because I was covering an area the size of West Virginia with only a company of men, or battalion, I should say. And so I was very embittered at our government about that. But it never made me an isolationist, because I think, looking at the world in a rational way, we can\u2019t afford to be isolationist. I want security for the future of my kids, and I want economic security too. Part of that is going to be that we have to have friends, and we need strong friends. Because we don\u2019t have the mass that China has. And I\u2019m not talking about the military mass\u2014because I don\u2019t want to go to war with China\u2014but we don\u2019t actually have the actual manpower, economic leverage that we have, unless we have other friends, unless we have other allies. And when it comes to any kind of military support, having other friends that are with us. And I want to prevent wars. I think the best way for us to prevent wars is to have alliances, is to believe in actual treaty obligations, and also to find ways to prevent wars through multilateralism, through investments in bringing down, for example, poverty around the world. I mean, one of the reasons why I had such a hard time fighting over there is because everybody in western Iraq was trying to kill me, and some of these people weren\u2019t even trying to kill me because they were idealogues, but because they were poor. Some insurgent was going to give him a hundred bucks just to drop an IED at the side of the road, right? Like, I saw the actual results of instability in the world. And yes, there was a lot of bad leadership decisions and somewhat criminal decisions that came from the Bush administration. But tearing down the system that has actually brought the longest amount of peace, in general, in the longest time since World War II is just plain dumb. And some of the things that I think actually motivates these people to actually try to destroy these institutions is because: If there\u2019s less institutions that are connecting us, if there\u2019s more isolationism, it actually empowers the most powerful people within this country, which I don\u2019t think we want either. I see this as the opposite way. It doesn\u2019t mean we have to be everywhere. I certainly have not supported engagements or potential engagements all around the world. I supported us, for example, when it came to the JCPOA, because I don\u2019t want to go to war with Iran, under President Obama. I\u2019ve been against some of our potential expeditions and longstanding, overstayed, and out of compliance with some of our rules and regulations in terms of operating overseas, like in Syria and other countries. And I think we should have deep oversight. But this idea that we\u2019re just going to go to zero and close down the borders, I think is just not, when it comes to our alliances, is just not realistic. It\u2019s not going to happen, and I think it\u2019s going to make more unsafe than anything else, and I think will actually lead us to more of a situation in terms of a confrontation with China than less. Frum:You\u2019re on the border, and the Trump administration, one of its areas of greatest military adventurism has been with increased military activity in Mexico. They\u2019re overlying drones. They say the drones are unarmed, but they\u2019re drones that are capable of being armed. It looks like they didn\u2019t give the Mexican government advanced notice of all the drones that are flying. President Trump, the vice president, many others in the Republican Party have spoken about taking some kind of military action inside the territory of Mexico or on the seas that are just outside Mexico\u2019s territorial waters. How do you think about that as someone who represents Arizona? Gallego:We want, and we do have, a good relationship with the Mexican government in Arizona. Our police forces will talk to their police forces. They have problems. There\u2019s no doubt there\u2019s corruption. There\u2019s no doubt. But what you\u2019ve seen is when some of the best outcomes have always been when we\u2019ve actually worked with our friends and treated them like friends and allies, and helped them build their capability to fight back, fight corruption, fight these cartels, fight these terrorists. You\u2019ve seen some of the best COIN operations in, for example, Colombia that were effective. And I think we could continue doing that. But if we decide to do these unilateral actions without working with these countries, without giving them some level of respect, we\u2019re going to end up having less support from that government, but less support from the people who will continue to hide these horrible, horrible humans that are also terrorizing these communities. It\u2019s also very insulting to a lot of\u2014and this is something that I\u2019ve seen that we\u2019ve done, not just to them but to sort of Afghan allies we\u2019re not rolling in. It\u2019s insulting to them as if they don\u2019t have some agency, right? Thousands and thousands of Mexican police officers, government workers die every year fighting these cartels. And the fact that we kind of give this whole broad brush and say they\u2019re all corrupt, they\u2019re all evil I think is something that\u2019s going, again, to not help us make friends where we need friends to fight these organizations. Frum:Well, you mentioned Colombia. Until a little while ago, it looked like one of the big successes of American policy in the 21st century: Plan Colombia that restored order, the reorientation of the Colombian economy away from drugs to exporting agricultural goods that serve people rather than killed people. Colombia got hit with a wave of tariffs by the Trump administration. Now he\u2019s helped to legitimate the far left that has come back into Colombian politics. Is that a situation that you follow, and what lessons do you see for countering surgency from the Colombian experience? Gallego:Yeah, I do follow it a lot. Look\u2014you know, when President Petro of Colombia really used this opportunity to kind of create this jingoistic situation where you\u2019re able to draw attention to the sins of what the United States is doing, and not necessarily the things that are occurring in Colombia, which economically aren\u2019t great. And when you\u2019re putting tariffs, you\u2019re creating two things: Number one, for your kind of marginal farmer, especially out in rural Colombia, doing, you know\u2014export farming is profitable, but not that much. And it is also fairly marginal, right? It is a lot more profitable for you to farm and harvest cocoa, right? And other, drug, products. And so you\u2019re making an economic incentive for people to move away. You\u2019re also messing with our economy, too (the United States economy), because talking to some of these big industries down there who import American flour, corn, soy\u2014they\u2019re right now looking for new partners anywhere else besides the United States because they don\u2019t want to deal with the drama ofAm I under a tariff?versusAm I not under a tariff? You know, their biggest import from the United States is actually soy, which is ridiculous considering they\u2019re essentially next to\u2014they share a border with\u2014Brazil. Now, you know, the Brazilian soy market is hunting around in Colombia, trying to basically say, like,We\u2019re your better partner. They\u2019re gonna\u2014look: They\u2019re gonna try to get flour from somewhere else. You know, the Colombian farmers, because it\u2019s a very volcanic earth, really value American tractors and farm equipment because they\u2019re solid. You know, they have a great reputation. They\u2019re easy to fix. The parts are easy to get. And now they\u2019re trying to get new products from Korea, from China, from Europe, because they don\u2019t want to deal every year, again, with whether your tractor is going to end up having a 10 percent, 20 percent tariff or counter-tariffs. So this is the instability we\u2019re causing. That what was essentially unnecessary instability, right? Because Colombia has always accepted Colombians that are being returned for deportation. All they were asking is, like,Hey\u2014just don\u2019t bring them in a military plane and we\u2019re fine. And I think that\u2019s some of the least thing we\u2014one of the things we could do to keep relations, to keep the flow going, obviously, people that should be deported. But, you know, we end up, again, shooting ourselves in the foot because the way that this administration does security is they focus on being tough and not smart. They focus on showing, like,We\u2019re gonna do these things, but at the end of the day, all they\u2019re doing is causing more chaos. They were talking about criminals, and now they\u2019re rounding up kids, rounding up parents, rounding up workers that we need, just so they could prove that they\u2019re wrong, when the voter really did not ask for that. They didn\u2019t ask for this, they asked for criminals. They asked for a tighter border; they got a tighter border. But now you\u2019re deporting families just so you could say you\u2019re hitting these arbitrary numbers that Stephen Miller wants. Frum:A lot of you\u2014you talk about the harm of tariffs very eloquently. A lot of people in your party have been having a difficult time articulating a tariff message because they actually kind of like tariffs. If President Trump has been the most protectionist president since 1945, President Biden was the second-most. And so you hear a lot of Democrats saying things like,Well, I\u2019m against dumb tariffs. I\u2019m for smart tariffs, implying they\u2019re for smart tariffs, implying that there is or could be such a thing as a smart tariff. And the result is you have a very narrow difference. And to your point just now, I mean, when Democrats say,I want to do the same thing as Donald Trump, but I want to do it smarter, what a lot of people hear is not,Well, you are smarter.[It\u2019s]Oh, you\u2019re the party of people who think they\u2019re so smart, but you don\u2019t actually have a principled criticism of what the president does. You\u2019re just showing off that you think you\u2019re better educated and more intelligent. But you want to do the same thing, only with fancier words, the way you always want to do it. So are there Democrats who are going to be able to say,You know what? Tariffs are just dumb. Don\u2019t do them. We should trade in peace and freedom with the rest of the world? Gallego:Are there? \u2014I mean, I\u2019m not a miracle worker here, David. But look\u2014what we\u2019ve seen in terms of the turnaround in our economy, right? If you would\u2019ve said eight years ago that the United States was gonna be able to manufacture the majority of the chips it needs within 10 years, we would\u2019ve been like,You\u2019re freaking nuts, right? Because all the chip manufacturing was being done overseas. And within that short time period, we were able to stand up and move U.S. manufacturing of advanced chips to a point where we\u2019re going to be net exporters in the next couple years. That wasn\u2019t from tariff policy; that was from an actual industrial policy about how we\u2019re actually gonna brick this back, right? And we need to figure out how we can bring certain industries back and how we could do it smartly by competing, right? By having the best workers possible, by having the best industry possible, with having the best regulatory frameworks they could add to the tax policies, everything else. Like, that\u2019s how you make it. So you could actually bring these middle-class jobs back. But the other thing that really annoys me is that, like, who do they think works these middle-class jobs? Who do you think works these factories? Right now they\u2019re about, last I heard\u2014I\u2019d have to go back and check. But, you know, we\u2019re probably close to a million\u2014sorry, we\u2019re at about a million factory jobs that are opening right now. Those are immigrants that work those jobs. When I was working at a meat factory, growing up, I got $1 more because I was the only one that spoke English\u2014or, well,Ispoke English. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s others that spoke English too. But the people that worked at that factory were Mexican immigrants and Polish immigrants, right? So let\u2019s say we do build that steel plant here. First of all, let\u2019s find the investors that are willing to put in the seven to 10 years to build it. Like, the people that work in a lot of these places are the people that we\u2019re trying to kick out of this country right now, or won\u2019t let in. And so how are we\u2014how is this smart in any way? Frum:You come from one of the most outward-facing states in America, in the country\u2014a border state, a state with a dynamic economy, a state of entrepreneurship and immigration. If anyone\u2019s gonna carry a flag for open trade, free trade, it\u2019s gonna be a senator from Arizona. John McCain was a great free trader. Can we look to the senators from Arizona to lead the fight against tariffs and for free trade? Gallego:Yeah. No, like, I think I can\u2019t speak for the other senator, but what we\u2019ve seen is, like, Arizona is richer because of trade\u2014and not just, by the way, [with] Mexico, which, by the way, has definitely been a big driver, besides the fact that everyone just focuses on the security side of it. We are actually a richer state, and the country would be much richer if we actually made our ports of entries faster, more aggressive, and predictable in some regards because some people don\u2019t know when they\u2019re gonna come in. But we are now trading with, you know, all around the world. We just opened up a direct airline route, or will be soon, from Phoenix to Taiwan. Our jobs, our high-skilled jobs, our highest-paying jobs are due to trade. And in some regard, if we actually want stability, especially in the Western hemisphere, we should embrace free trade that, you know, emphasizes our brothers and sisters south of the border getting good-paying jobs, getting those industry jobs that we don\u2019t want to do in the United States, so they could stop the migrations that are moving here to the United States. There is a way for this all to be a win-win for the United States. And I think using our ability, in terms of our superpower\u2014which I think our biggest superpower is actually human capital\u2014where we can bring anyone from all around the world and use their drive, their brainpower and put it into this massive other amount of brainpower to experiences all around the world. We could outcompete anybody, but we actually have to believe in them. We have to make the investments in them. And I think that is going to be a better way to actually move the middle class, get them those jobs that they need, than these types of, like, ham-fisted tariff policies. Frum:Last question, because I know we have a hard out, and you\u2019ve been very generous with your time. You came from a tough background. You had an astonishing career. Your talent was picked out early. You went to Harvard. You volunteered. You saw some dark things in combat. You came back. You chose politics after that background at a strikingly early age. You didn\u2019t get rich first. You went into politics directly. Gallego:I did want to get rich first, to be honest. (Laughs.) Frum:(Laughs.) Why did you choose politics? Gallego:You know, I think it really chose me. I always wanted to do government service. I actually thought that I was going to end up in the State Department, or the FBI, or something of that nature. I got back from the war\u2014I mean, I was fucked up, to be honest. You know, my best friend died. It was seven months of just hard, hard combat. And then we got back and, you know, we were Reservists, and they just let us go, right? So two weeks after I get back from Iraq, I am given my orders, I throw my stuff in my sea bag, and they\u2019re,Right. You\u2019re out; you\u2019re gone.You know, no housing, nothing. And luckily, I had friends and family to fall upon. But then the stories started coming from my guys that they were having problems getting jobs. They were having problems getting VA treatments, getting into the VA\u2014all these things that were just terrifying to me. And I was already pissed from the war because, again, they sent me to war without the proper armor on our vehicles, proper intelligence, without enough manpower, all this kind of stuff. And so I found myself talking more and more to these guys about\u2014these guys, my brothers\u2014trying to help them get into the VA, trying to help them get into school. You know, some of them were living on my couch for a little bit to keep them off the streets. And I started complaining to the state reps, to the state senators,Why can\u2019t my guys have in-state tuition?Marines would be overseas for three years, and they\u2019d come back to their home state or to another state, and they say, like,Well, you never lived here.Like,Yeah, well, I\u2019ve been gone forever. And it just kept on coming back and forth, back and forth, and I just kept complaining to congressmen and to everybody. And I realized that, I mean, everyone talks a big game, but no one really gives anfabout us until they really need us. But I have a purpose here, and it\u2019s going to continue to service. You know, my guys and I are going to have our 20-year reunion this year. I\u2019m 45. I\u2019m one of the older side of veterans, and if I\u2019m not doing this right now, you know, who\u2019s going to hold this administration to the fire? They want to cut 83,000 veteran\u2014VA employees arbitrarily, right? And for me, I\u2019m able to use my position as a veteran, as a combat veteran, and I\u2019m pushing back on them. I\u2019m not sure if I was here, would someone be doing as aggressively as I am? And I think that that tells me I\u2019m doing something right. Frum:Thank you. Thank you for the time today. I\u2019m really grateful. Thank you for the candor. It\u2019s been an interesting conversation. I really appreciate you taking the time for us. Bye-bye. Gallego:Appreciate it. Adios. [Music] Frum:Thanks so much to Senator Gallego for joining me here onThe David Frum Show. Remember, if you enjoy this dialogue and similar content, please subscribe toThe Atlantic. That\u2019s the best way to support the work ofThe David Frum Showand all of myAtlanticcolleagues. I\u2019m going to close with some farewell thoughts about the weekend ahead. If you are planning to fly into Washington, D.C., over the weekend of June 14, be prepared for a lot of airplane closures. Reagan National Airport will be closed, and traffic at the other regional airports is likely to be disrupted. The reason for this is the big parade scheduled for June 14. Now, ostensibly, this is a parade to salute the 250th anniversary of the United States Army, founded in June of 1775. But we all know this story is not true. The Continental Navy was founded in the fall of 1775, and the Marines shortly thereafter. They, too, are celebrating 250th anniversaries this year. No parade for them, because their anniversaries do not coincide with the birthday of President Trump. President Trump is throwing a big birthday bash for himself at public expense, making a parade, which he has wanted for a long time. And the Army is his excuse but not his motive. As I say, if it were the real thing, you would find a way to honor the Army, the Navy, and the Marine Corps together, all of them celebrating their 250th anniversary this year. Now, President Trump has wanted a big military parade since he saw one in France in his first term, on Bastille Day. The Army and the other services, the Department of Defense, resisted this demand for a long time, and for three main reasons. The first was the reason of expense. The Trump birthday party, the military component of it, will cost, all in\u2014both the cost of the parade and the cost of repaving the city streets afterwards\u2014probably in the vicinity of $100 million. That\u2019s a very large amount of money, even by military standards. And in the first term, at least, the money would\u2019ve been spent at a time of general prosperity and pretty lax controls of spending. In the second term, President Trump is engaged in massive budget cuts throughout the rest of the government. We\u2019ve eliminated the PEPFAR program for Africa that delivers anti-HIV drugs to Africans of all ages, and especially children. People\u2019s lives are at risk to save the $7 billion that PEPFAR costs. It\u2019s indecent to be cutting PEPFAR and throwing the president a $100 million birthday party. So the military has resisted on grounds of expense. They\u2019ve also resisted on grounds of uselessness. Look\u2014parades used to serve a purpose. The skills on display in a parade\u2014marching in step, the cavalry trotting in line\u2014those were highly relevant military skills in the days when armies fought in formation, when infantry formed into line, when cavalry moved at a trot. But in today\u2019s world, the skills that you need to do at a parade have nothing to do with how armies fight. And the weeks and weeks of preparation that the units have to do in order to be ready for the parade is just a waste of time. And these are all, by the way, highly paid, highly skilled professionals. Their time is valuable. We want our war fighters, as Secretary of Defense Hegseth calls them, to be preparing to fight actual 21st-century war, not demonstrating their skill and readiness to fight the wars of the 18th and early 19th century. But there\u2019s an even more fundamental reason that the Army resisted for such a long time, and that was: They sensed there was something political about these parades. Trump was not doing this, really, to salute the military. He was summoning the military to salute him. And the military, rightly, would never refuse an order, but they would point out,This is expensive. This is a distraction. And if you order us to do it, we will leak the details of how expensive and how useless it is to the newspapers, so that everyone will see what you are doing. That was the first term. But in this second term, the military is headed by people who\u2014unlike the military leadership in the first term\u2014under Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, pose no resistance to the orders and demands and wishes and imperatives and whims of President Trump. The Hegseth DOD is an arm of Trump\u2019s PR politics. And so it\u2019s all parade, all the time. There is no one now to advocate for the interests of the national defense against the whims of the president. I think this you\u2019ve all heard before, but there\u2019s something else I want to point out here. The idea that a president would cause massive inconvenience to the traveling public, disrupt the traffic of the District of Columbia, all to honor himself is a real slap in the face and a real denial of the fundamental relationship that the constitutional system envisions between the president and the people. The president is a public servant. He is the highest-ranking government employee. He\u2019s not the master. He\u2019s not the king. He\u2019s not the emperor. Traditionally, presidents receive no honor of any kind in their own lifetimes. If they had distinguished themselves in office, after they had passed then they would be honored in all kinds of ways: the Lincoln Memorial, the Jefferson Monument. Everything\u2019s the other way around. I think it\u2019s the Lincoln Monument and the Jefferson Memorial. You\u2019d issue postage stamps for them. The streets would be named for them, counties. There are Jackson Counties all over the United States. Presidents were honored after the end of their lifetime. But in their time, they were just another government employee, like the undersecretary of agriculture. And there certainly was no public commemoration of their birthdays. Donald Trump does not see himself as a public servant. He sees himself as a public master. That\u2019s why he\u2019s always demanding thanks for his allocation of government resources. When President Trump sends emergency assistance to a county that\u2019s in need, it\u2019s not his money. No one owes him any thank-you. He\u2019s doing his job, sending the public\u2019s money to the place where public law provides for it to go. And yet he thinks, because he is the president, he, therefore, is owed deference, he is owed obedience, he\u2019s owed thanks, and he\u2019s owed a parade. And this habit of thinking is spreading through his government. Other Cabinet secretaries have also given themselves birthday parties of public expense and have issued statements on Twitter saluting the Cabinet secretary for the birthday. It\u2019s a habit that grows from the top down, and it\u2019s a violation of the way that Americans used to conduct themselves. Look\u2014in Britain, there\u2019s a long and lively tradition of military parades on the monarch\u2019s birthday. They troop the colors. In fact, this year, the trooping of the colors for King Charles\u2019s birthday will be June 14. Charles\u2019s birthday will be June 14, just like President Trump\u2019s parade. But Charles\u2019s parade is not on his actual birthday; his actual birthday is in November. but he\u2019s going to have his parade on June 14 because that\u2019s the best day for the public to watch it and enjoy it, and it\u2019s also the easiest day for the troops to parade. If you know London, you\u2019d much rather parade in the June sunshine than in the November gloom and rain. So Charles, the king of England, is thinking of others when he arranges the continuation of the long-established tradition of the trooping of the colors on the monarch\u2019s birthday. President Trump, ostensibly a servant of the people, ostensibly a lowercaserRepublican official, ostensibly just the highest-ranking person in the government bureaucracy\u2014he\u2019s doing more than King Charles to honor himself at other people\u2019s expense and other people\u2019s inconvenience. It\u2019s not the biggest scandal of the Trump administration by any means, but in some ways it\u2019s the most revealing. Thanks so much for joining me today. I\u2019m David Frum.
