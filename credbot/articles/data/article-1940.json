Heritage fileda lawsuitagainst Airbnb earlier this month after the company excluded a Heritage proposal from its annual shareholder meeting. Heritage, an Airbnb shareholder, filed its proposal for the housing rental giant to reject politicized, antisemitic activist demands to divest from vendors in locations like Israel. Unfortunately, corporate America\u2014even before the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attacks in Israel\u2014started to fall captiveto the anti-Israel boycott, divestment, and sanctions movement. This lawsuit comes after a series of efforts in recent years by Heritage and other groups, including education, publicity, and pressure campaigns, to highlight the risks corporations face when ideology overtakes accountability. Heritage reports in its filing that it followed all requirements and time stipulations for submitting its shareholder proposal. Airbnb claims it never received the shareholder proposal packet, despite Heritage receiving a FedEx delivery receipt with the signature of an Airbnb employee confirming delivery. Airbnb refuses all knowledge of the proposal and\u2014shockingly\u2014even suggested FedEx forged the signature of its own employee who confirmed delivery. Heritage filed the lawsuit together with American Conservative Values ETF, another shareholder of Airbnb, which also submitted a proposal that Airbnb excluded. Heritage is represented by Boyden Gray and American Conservative Values ETF is represented by Alliance Defending Freedom. \u201cAirbnb broke the law\u2014plain and simple. [Securities and Exchange Commission] rules require companies to notify shareholders and allow a response if a proposal is excluded,\u201d Andrew Olivastro, chief advancement officer at The Heritage Foundation,said in a statement. \u201cAirbnb ignored those rules and ignored the law. It makes you wonder what other legal corners Airbnb may have cut. Heritage and ADF are suing to make one thing clear: shareholder rights aren\u2019t subject to mood or politics\u2014they\u2019re protected by law.\u201d Under SEC regulations, Airbnb is required to include proposals in its materials for its annual shareholder meeting\u2014unless the company notifies those submitting the proposals that the materials will be excluded, provides reasons for its exclusion, and gives filing shareholders a chance to respond. Airbnb did not notify Heritage of its proposal\u2019s exclusion or allow Heritage to take any action. Airbnb did, however, include a proposal from Connecticut Retirement Plans and Trust Funds, a liberal-leaning fund that openly supports initiatives like the environmental, social, and governance scorecard for \u201csocially conscious\u201d investing. This appears to be blatant viewpoint discrimination by Airbnb. The December proposal submitted by Heritage highlighted the fact that Airbnb caved to antisemitic political demands in the past\u2014including its announcement in 2018 to remove 200 \u201cIsraeli settlements in the occupied West Bank,\u201d noting strong views of \u201chistoric and intense disputes between Israelis and Palestinians in the West Bank\u201d from those who \u201cbelieve companies should not profit on lands where people have been displaced.\u201d While Airbnb reversed its decision a year later, the precedent for caving to political demands had been set. When the exclusion of the proposals was brought to Airbnb\u2019s attention in April, the company refused to include it in materials for its June meeting, nor would the company agree to include the proposal in materials for the 2026 meeting. Heritage works closely with the State Financial Officers Foundation, where I previously served as an economic research fellow. Heritageawarded Innovation Prizesto the foundation, Alliance Defending Freedom, and others, including the Independent Women\u2019s Forum, to fight woke capitalism. The State Financial Officers Foundation is a coalition of 39 financial leaders from 28 states. During the Biden administration, the groupmarshaled its market muscle\u2014roughly $3 trillion in public assets under management\u2014to force banks and other financial institutions to quit targeting conservatives and imposing far-left ideologies on taxpayers. The goal of these efforts is to restore objectivity and neutrality to business. By calling for transparency and fairness, Heritage and its partners are rallying Americans to demand that businesses prioritize merit, ethics and unity over divisive, politicized agendas. Now it\u2019s time for the court of law to enact justice toward this end. Carrie Sheffield is a senior policy analyst for the Center for Economic Opportunity atIndependent Women\u2019s Forum.
