Wingard was appointed to the school board in a 4-0 vote with no opposition at the May 27 meeting. At the work session preceding the June 10 meeting, the council went into an executive session to discuss the \u201cgeneral reputation and character of an individual.\u201d At the council meeting that followed, Councilwoman Stephanie Baker made a motion to rescind Wingard\u2019s appointment. \u201cAt the last council meeting we took action to appoint (someone) to the Troy City Schools Board of Education,\u201d Baker said. \u201cAt that time, to be perfectly honest, I took that vote with limited time and information, and since then, with the pleasure of a little bit more of those items, I feel burdened tonight to make a motion to rescind that vote.\u201d Councilman Max Davis seconded the motion and he, Baker and Councilman Greg Meeks all voted to approve the motion to rescind the vote. Councilwoman Sharon McSwain-Holland abstained from the vote. Holland was not at the prior meeting. Councilwoman Wanda Moultry, who nominated Wingard, was the only opposition to the motion, which carried with a 3-1-1 vote. \u201cThe only comment I have is that I am seeking legal advice on a matter of process and procedures that are done as it relates to an appointment to my district, District 5, to the Board of Education,\u201d Moultry toldThe Messenger. \u201cI\u2019m seeking legal advice in regards to that matter and what I need to do to proceed.\u201d Wingard, who has a child in the Troy City Schools school system, said Wednesday she believes the decision to rescind her appointment came after some aldermen received pushback from community members upset over how vocal she is about the school system. \u201cTo my understanding, there are a lot of people that are upset with my appointment because I\u2019m too vocal because I am a parent that stayed on those teachers (at Troy Elementary School) and spoke out frequently when it comes to my son,\u201d Wingard said. Wingard said an issue with a teacher has caused her to speak out regarding her son\u2019s treatment. \u201cThere has been an issue with a particular teacher over there that has had a lot of negative run-ins with not just my son but other kids as well,\u201d Wingard continued.Wingard said that she had tried for months to have a discussion with the teacher with no success. The issue culminated on May 15 when Wingard went to Troy Elementary to speak to the teacher. \u201cI entered the school on May 15 to go speak with that teacher but I didn\u2019t sign into the office,\u201d Wingard said. \u201cI\u2019ve always been a parent that would be vocal and have meetings with the principal and send emails to the board and superintendent about stuff that has gone on at the schools.\u201d Wingard acknowledges that she should have signed in at the school office but emphasized there was no ill intent on her part. \u201cWas I wrong for not singing into that office? I was,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was a decision I made and I stand behind that decision. I made that decision to speak to (the teacher) without signing in first and I can\u2019t take that back; it\u2019s already done. What I do know is that I did not enter in a threatening or violent manner. I came to have a conversation, which I\u2019ve been trying to do the whole year. (The teacher) would always decline meeting us, and I was informed that teachers have the right to decline speaking to parents.\u201d Wingard said the teacher in question again refused to speak to her but that another teacher pulled her aside and spoke to her. \u201cI was not wrong for being a parent who wanted to ensure that my child is OK over there,\u201d Wingard emphasized. Wingard also said that she is not alone in regards to her issues. \u201cIt\u2019s not just me. Over 30 parents have reached out to me and had the same run-ins with the same teacher and made the same exact complaints and went to the school and nothing has been done,\u201d said Wingard. Wingard said that it\u2019s her belief that those in leadership positions should be the ones who are vocal about student treatment. \u201cThe board of education \u2013 as well as the city council \u2013 and those types of positions are here to fight for those kids who don\u2019t have a voice to be able to speak up against adults,\u201d she said. \u201cOur job is to ensure these kids receive the best education possible and they are in a safe school environment and not a hostile one, so that they can learn and be kids and can grow and form healthy relationships.\u201d Regardless of the outcome over this situation, Wingard said she won\u2019t be quiet. \u201cI\u2019m not going to just roll over and just let this be,\u201d she stated emphatically. \u201cI\u2019m not, I\u2019m just not. I won\u2019t let that happen.\u201d **Troy City Council recognizes City of Troy Queens** **Harrison Camwell\u2019s way of giving back** **\u2018Kids Fishing Day\u2019 a Pike County tradition** **Trojan Patriot Academy kicks off second year** Home News Sports Opinion Lifestyles Obituaries Business Small Business About Us Subscriptions Policies Submit a News Tip Submit a Photo Submit a Letter to the Editor Birth Announcement Birthday Announcement Engagement Announcement Wedding Announcement \u00a9 2025, The Troy Messenger"}
