6/10/2025,Article,News,School shooting leaves Austria's second city in shock and grief,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/cewd980dgl9o,"There is shock, sadness and disbelief in Graz, after the worst shooting in modern Austrian history left 11 people dead, including the gunman. ""We never could have imagined that this could have happened here, in our place. It's a sad day for the whole city,"" said Reka, who lives close to the school. For many years, Austria had been spared the pain of mass school shootings. But that all changed at about 10:00 on Tuesday when a former student ran amok at a secondary school in the Dreierschützengasse, close to the main station in Austria's second largest city. Morning classes were under way when the attack took place. Some students at the school would have been taking their final exams. It took police 17 minutes to bring the situation under control. By the time it was over six female victims and three males had died. Hours later, a seventh female victim, an adult woman, died in hospital. Several others remain in hospital, some with critical injuries. The gunman, a 21-year-old Austrian citizen with two firearms, took his own life at the school. A former pupil who never passed his final exams, he is reported to have seen himself as a victim of bullying. Local resident Reka told me she couldn't understand how an attack like this could have happened in her well-ordered city. ""This area is quiet, safe and beautiful,"" she said. ""People are nice, the school is good."" Austria's President Alexander Van der Bellen said: ""This horror cannot be put into words. What happened today in a school in Graz, hits our country right in the heart. These were young people who had their whole lives ahead of them. A teacher who accompanied them on their way."" He said there was ""nothing at this moment that can alleviate the pain that the parents, grandparents, siblings and friends of those murdered are feeling"". Austria's Chancellor Christian Stocker, who rushed to the scene with the Interior Minister Gerhard Karner, called it ""a national tragedy, that had shaken the entire country."" He said there were no words to describe ""the pain and grief that we all – the whole of Austria – is feeling"". Three days of mourning have been declared in Austria. Flags on the Hofburg Palace in Vienna, where President van der Bellen has his office, will fly at half-mast. Austria has one of the most heavily armed civilian populations in Europe, with an estimated 30 firearms per 100 persons, according to the Small Arms Survey, an independent research project. But school shootings here are rare. There have been a few incidents over the years that have involved far fewer casualties: Austria's most violent gun attack in recent years took place in the heart of Vienna in November 2020. Four people were killed and 22 injured when a convicted jihadist ran through the centre of the city opening fire, before he was eventually shot by police. Machine guns and pump action guns are banned, while revolvers, pistols and semi-automatic weapons are allowed only with official authorisation. Rifles and shotguns are permitted with a firearms licence or a valid hunting licence, or for members of traditional shooting clubs. The Graz gunman is understood to have owned both firearms legally, and he had no criminal record. One of his guns was bought only the day before the attack, according to one report. Outside the school, a young man on a bicycle watched as the police allowed security vehicles through the security cordon round the school. ""It's horrific,"" he told me. ""This is my home. I can't understand how so many people my age are dead. This shouldn't happen here."" Copyright 2025 BBC.

6/10/2025,Article,News,Newsom says Trump 'deranged' as thousands more troops sent to LA,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/cyvmz3egr7do,"US President Donald Trump's administration has sent thousands more troops to Los Angeles on a fourth day of chaotic protests against immigration raids, as the unrest spread to other US cities. Some 700 US Marines have been deployed to the LA area and the contingent of National Guard troops mobilised to help quell the disorder has been doubled to 4,000. California Governor Gavin Newsom said the move was fulfilling ""the deranged fantasy of a dictatorial president"". The state is suing the president for sending in troops without the governor's permission. It is highly unusual for the American military to have any domestic law enforcement role. At least four Mexican nationals detained in LA since Friday have already been deported back to Mexico, the country's foreign affairs office announced on Monday. The standoff in LA represents the first time since 1965 that a president has sent National Guard troops to a US city without a governor's approval. US Marines were previously deployed domestically for major disasters such as Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and the 11 September 2001 attacks. The Trump administration has so far not invoked the Insurrection Act, which would allow his deployed troops to directly participate in civilian policing. On Tuesday morning, the LA County prosecutor reiterated the view of state authorities that the extra deployment was unnecessary. ""We have not reached the point where local law enforcement has got beyond its means to deal with the situation,"" District Attorney Nathan Hochman told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Hochman said only a ""small fraction"" of the area's population were actually protesting, and an even smaller number had broken the law.  But he said there had been multiple instances of crime, ""whether it's burning Waymo vehicles, throwing cinder blocks and bricks at the police, driving a motorcycle into the police, or vandalising - and defacing through graffiti - public and private buildings"". The 700 members of 2nd Battalion, 7th Marines, from Twentynine Palms, California, will help protect federal property and personnel, including immigration agents, said the US military. On Monday evening, Los Angeles police officers fired stun grenades and gas canisters to disperse hundreds of demonstrators who gathered outside a federal detention centre in downtown LA where undocumented immigrants have been held. National Guard forces formed a cordon to keep protesters out of the building in the heart of America's second largest city. Some demonstrators had thrown objects at officers, the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) also said on Monday. Late that day, US Attorney General Pam Bondi revealed the identity of a man accused of assault for throwing rocks at federal agents. Bondi said a search warrant has been conducted on his home, and that the man, Elpidio Reyna, would be added to America's ""Most Wanted"" list.  Protests also sprang up in at least nine other US cities, including New York, Philadelphia, Dallas, Austin and San Francisco. Demonstrators originally took to the streets of LA on Friday after it emerged Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers were raiding Latino areas. The protests unravelled into looting, self-driving cars being torched, rocks thrown at law enforcement and a major freeway blocked by demonstrators. The LAPD says it arrested 29 people on Saturday night and 21 more on Sunday. Suspects face charges ranging from attempted murder with a Molotov cocktail, to assault on a police officer, to looting. The LAPD also says more than 600 rubber bullets and other less-than-lethal rounds were used over the weekend. At the White House on Monday, Trump said his decision to send in the National Guard had stopped the city from ""burning down"". ""You watch same clips I did: cars burning, people rioting, we stopped it,"" the president said. ""I feel we had no choice."" A CBS News/YouGov poll conducted in early June, before the protests kicked off, found 54% of Americans saying they approved of Trump's deportation policy, and 50% approved of how he is handling immigration.  That compares with smaller numbers of 42% who gave approval to his economic policy and 39% for his policy on tackling inflation.  On Monday, the Republican president said he supported a suggestion that California's governor should be arrested over possible obstruction of his administration's immigration enforcement measures. Newsom, who has engaged in a war of words in recent days with Trump, responded on X that ""this is an unmistakable step toward authoritarianism"". He said the troop deployment was ""about stroking a dangerous president's ego"". Trump's border tsar Tom Homan later told CNN he had ""not at this time"" seen anything that he felt would warrant an arrest of the California governor. Trump also sent a direct warning to protesters who confronted police and federal forces. He wrote on social media: ""IF THEY SPIT, WE WILL HIT, and I promise you they will be hit harder than they have ever been hit before. Such disrespect will not be tolerated!"" At a press conference on Monday evening, LA Mayor Karen Bass echoed the views of other local officials by saying the deployment of troops was a ""deliberate attempt"" by the Trump administration to ""create disorder and chaos in our city"". The city leader also said she was aware of at least ""five raids by ICE throughout the region"" on Monday, including one near her grandson's school. Trump's deployment of the National Guard faces a legal challenge from Newsom. The lawsuit argues that the president was violating the US Constitution and California's sovereignty. Newsom has also threatened to take separate legal action over the Marine deployment.  Trump has argued that the administration of his predecessor, Democratic President Joe Biden, allowed millions of immigrants to enter the country illegally. He has pledged to deport record numbers of undocumented migrants, setting a goal of at least 3,000 daily arrests. Copyright 2025 BBC.

Protesters were filmed on Monday in cities including Boston, Houston and Philadelphia, as demonstrations entered their fourth day in Los Angeles. Trump sent another 2,000 National Guard troops to LA - as well as 700 US Marines - even as protests quietened towards the end of the day. Copyright 2025 BBC.

6/10/2025,Article,News,Everything we know about the LA protests,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/cj93d3r0zz0o,"Dozens of people have been arrested in Los Angeles after days of violent protests, which erupted following immigration raids.  US President Donald Trump deployed 2,000 National Guard troops to the city, triggering outrage from Democrats. Then on Monday he ordered another 2,000 troops and 700 marines to deploy to the city, too.  People began gathering after federal immigration officers arrested large groups of unauthorised immigrants in areas with large Latino populations. While the demonstrations started out as peaceful, some self-driving vehicles were set on fire and a major highway was shut down by protesters over the weekend before the unrest began to calm later on Monday.  The protests began on Friday after it emerged Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers were carrying out raids in areas of the city with prominent Latino populations.  Raids have stepped up after Trump returned to the White House and pledged to crack down on illegal immigration.  The BBC's US partner, CBS News, reported that recent operations took place in the Westlake district as well as in Paramount, south of LA - where the population is more than 82% Hispanic. There were also reports of an ICE raid at a Home Depot shop in Paramount, which officials told the BBC were false. ICE later told CBS that 44 unauthorised immigrants were arrested in a single operation at a job site on Friday. Another 77 were also arrested in the greater LA area on the same day. The protests have been largely limited to downtown LA, which has been declared an ""unlawful assembly"" area by police after days of clashes.  Elsewhere in the sprawling city of LA, life continues as normal - and some areas were closed off over the weekend for the LA Pride parade. On Saturday, Trump deployed 2,000 National Guard members to the Los Angeles area, triggering a political row with state politicians. On Monday evening, he ordered another 2,000 National Guard members to the west-coast city. The Pentagon also called up 700 marines to assist with the efforts. The National Guard acts as a hybrid entity that serves both state and federal interests. Typically, a state's force is activated at the request of the governor.  Trump circumvented that step by invoking a rarely-used federal law, arguing that the protests constituted ""a form of rebellion against the authority of the government of the United States"". This is reportedly the first time the National Guard has been activated without request of the state's governor since 1965. The move has been condemned by California Governor Gavin Newsom and LA Mayor Karen Bass, who said they believed local police could handle the situation.  Newsom accused Trump of an ""illegal"" act that was ""putting fuel on this fire"", and then sued Trump's administration. In its lawsuit filed on Monday, California argued that Trump was going against the US Constitution, which has protections for states' rights , in deploying the guard against the governor's wishes. The 10th amendment says that any power not expressly granted to the federal government in the Constitution goes to the states. California Attorney General Rob Bonta called the deployment an ""inflammatory escalation unsupported by conditions on the ground"" and ""exceeds the federal government's authority"". A CBS News/YouGov poll conducted in early June, before the protests kicked off, found 54% of Americans saying they approved of Trump's deportation policy, and 50% approved of how he is handling immigration. That compares with smaller numbers of 42% who gave approval to his economic policy and 39% for his policy on tackling inflation. The role of the National Guard is to protect federal agents, including ICE and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) personnel, as they carry out their duties.  The troops will not be conducting their own immigration raids or performing regular policing - which remains the role of the (LAPD).  The law generally prohibits domestic use of federal troops for civilian law enforcement, outside of some exceptions like the Insurrection Act.  Although Trump has threatened to invoke that act in the past, during the Black Lives Matter protests of 2020, for example, he has not done so here.  Trump's allies have defended his decision to mobilise the National Guard. Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth also said active-duty US marines stationed at nearby Camp Pendleton would be sent if needed and were on ""high alert"".  The recent raids are part of the president's aim to enact the ""biggest deportation operation"" in US history. Los Angeles, where over one-third of the population is born outside of the US, has been a key target for operations. In early May, ICE announced it had arrested 239 undocumented migrants during a week-long operation in the LA area, as overall arrests and deportations lagged behind Trump's expectations.  The following month, the White House increased its goal for ICE officials to make at least 3,000 arrests per day. Authorities have expanded their search increasingly to include workplaces such as restaurants and retail shops.  The ambitious deportation campaign has included removing migrants to a mega-prison in El Salvador, including at least one who was in the US legally. Many of Trump's actions have been met by legal challenges.  Copyright 2025 BBC.

6/10/2025,Article,News,Four crew members missing as Singapore-flagged cargo ship burns off India coast,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/cd7g9el8q15o,"India's Coast Guard is continuing efforts to douse a fire on a Singapore-flagged cargo ship in the Arabian Sea near the coast of the southern state of Kerala. MV Wan Hai 503, which was heading to India's Mumbai city from Sri Lanka's Colombo, reported an internal container explosion on Monday, resulting in a major fire on board. Eighteen crew members have been rescued, while four are still missing. Singapore has sent a team to assist in the rescue efforts. The Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS) has issued an alert for the coast of Kerala due to potential oil spill and debris from the ship . Footage on Tuesday showed MV Wan Hai 503 emitting large plumes of smoke as the Indian Navy and Coast Guard tried to extinguish the fire onboard. The Coast Guard said fires and explosions continued to be seen on the ship. In a search and rescue operation carried out on Monday, 18 of the ship's 22 crew members were rescued and brought ashore where some of them are being treated for injuries. The crew members had abandoned the ship when the fire broke out and left on a boat after which they were rescued by the Navy, India's defence ministry said. The Singapore Maritime and Port Authority (MPA) said four crew members are still missing - two of them are from Taiwan, one from Myanmar and one from Indonesia. The MPA said that it has sent a team to help with the rescue. Kerala Ports Minister VN Vasavan said that 50 containers from the ship had fallen into the sea. The ship was carrying 100 tonnes of bunker oil, Mathrubhumi News reported. Containers that fell from it were drifting along the coast of Kerala, INCOIS told Manorama News, and could drift towards its coastline in the next three days.  This is the second such incident in three weeks near the Kerala coast. Last month, a Liberian-flagged vessel carrying oil and hazardous cargo leaked and sank in the Arabian Sea, sparking fears that harmful substances could endanger the health of residents and marine life. The state government then banned fishing within a 20-nautical mile radius of the shipwreck and announced compensation for families from fishing communities in four affected districts.  Kerala's coastal stretch is rich in biodiversity and the state is also an important tourist destination.  Follow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook. Copyright 2025 BBC.

6/10/2025,Article,News,Schoolchildren swept away as heavy floods and snow hit South Africa,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/c93lvxglykeo,"A minibus carrying schoolchildren has been swept away by heavy flooding in South Africa, a spokesperson for the Eastern Cape provincial government has told the BBC.  Khuselwa Rantjie said it was unclear how many children were on the bus, but three had so far been found alive. Rescue efforts had been suspended as night had fallen and would resume on Wednesday, she added.  In a separate incident, the bodies of seven people carried away by flood water have been found in the province's OR Tambo district. South Africa has been hit by heavy snow, rains and gale force winds that have claimed the lives of a further five people in a road accident, and have left nearly 500,000 homes without electricity. The Eastern Cape - the birthplace of anti-apartheid icon Nelson Mandela - has been worst-affected by the icy conditions, along with KwaZulu-Natal province.  The bad weather has forced the closure of some major roads in the two provinces to avoid further casualties.  ""This is a devastating reminder of nature's force. We urge everyone to exercise extra caution in areas prone to flooding,"" Eastern Cape premier Oscar Mabuyane said in a statement.  Five people died when a minibus taxi overturned near the coastal city of East London, with the driver saying he had lost control as he was trying to avoid a fallen tree, Eastern Cape transport department spokesperson, Unathi Binqose, told the BBC.  Two people were injured in the accident, he added.  State power utility Eskom said that almost 300,000 homes had been hit by electricity cuts in 14 towns and villages in Eastern Cape. A further 196,000 homes in 24 areas in KwaZulu-Natal were also experiencing power cuts, Eskom spokesperson Daphne Mokwena told the BBC.  KwaZulu-Natal Transport Minister Siboniso Duma said that heavy snow had led to lorries being stuck on roads, causing huge congestion. Grader machines have been stationed on worst-affected roads to clear snow before it reached more than 30cm (12in) in depth.  Meteorologist Lehlohonolo Thobela also warned of strong winds and heavy waves at sea, making navigation for ships difficult.  Both Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal are along the coast.  South Africa regularly receives snowfall during its winter months, from June through August, with temperatures diving below 0C (32F). There is also regular flooding and scientists say that climate change is causing heavier rainfall in the region.  Flash floods and overflowing rivers between 30 April and 2 May caused significant damage to about 4,500 homes, and left 18 people injured.

6/10/2025,Video,News,Syria former prison guard – 'I showed them no mercy',https://www.bbc.com//news/videos/c78034xn2jpo,"Dozens of former officials have spoken to the BBC about their role enforcing the brutality of the Assad regime – including a man who said he tortured detainees, then defected in 2012. The rare first-hand testimony forms part of a BBC investigation into Syria's notorious prisons under its former president, Bashar al-Assad, who was overthrown last December. A UN report earlier this year said detentions and torture under the former regime constitute crimes against humanity. Syrian human rights groups estimate that around 100,000 people disappeared under Assad's 24-year rule. The BBC agreed to conceal the identities of the former regime officials it spoke to on account of the value of their testimonies.

6/10/2025,Article,News,Teaching assistant killed in stabbing outside France school,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/c5y8mgrmdjvo,"A teaching assistant has died after being stabbed by a student outside a school in Nogent, north-east France, officials say. The 31-year-old teaching assistant was stabbed on Tuesday morning outside Françoise Dolto middle school as pupils' bags were being checked by police, the Haute-Marne prefecture said. French media reported a suspect had been taken into custody, with Prime Minister François Bayrou saying the student was 14 years old.  French President Emmanuel Macron said the teaching assistant was a ""victim of a senseless wave of violence"" and declared that ""the nation is in mourning"".  Politicians across parties condemned the attack and called for more action against knife crime. The suspect was not formerly known to police and the motive for the attack remains unconfirmed, local media reported.  Bayrou and French Education Minister Elisabeth Borne said the teaching assistant was stabbed by a student. Borne said she would travel to Nogent to visit the school, adding ""I commend the composure and dedication of those who acted to restrain the attacker"". Bayrou wrote on social media that ""our thoughts go out"" to the victim's ""little boy"", family, loved ones and the entire educational community. ""The threat of bladed weapons among our children has become critical"", Bayrou said, adding it is ""up to us to make this widespread scourge a public enemy"". Opposition politicians pushed back on the government to take more action. Marine Le Pen, leader of the far-right National Rally (RN), denounced what she called the ""trivialisation of ultraviolence, encouraged by the apathy of the public authorities to put an end to it"". ""Not a week goes by without a tragedy striking a school,"" she wrote on social media. Jordan Bardella, president of the RN, criticised Macron for what Bardella said was a ""denial"" of ""savagery"", seizing upon comments Macron made over the weekend. Speaking on Saturday ahead of the UN Conference on Oceans, Macron had said he did ""not want either the government or Parliament to give in to the conveniences of the moment"", criticising those ""who want to make people forget the fight for the climate"" and ""prefer, in the meantime, to brainwash people about the invasion of the country and the latest news"". There have been other recent knife attacks in schools. Last October, a teacher was killed during an attack at a school in the northern city of Arras. Following a stabbing at a high school in Nantes in April, Bayrou called for ""an intensification of controls put in place around and within schools"". At the end of April, the Ministry of National Education reported that 94 bladed weapons had been seized since March in 958 random bag checks at schools. Jean-Remi Girard, president of the National Union of Secondary Schools, said: ""It's impossible to be more vigilant 24 hours a day. We can't say that every student is a danger or a threat, otherwise we'd never get out of bed in the morning."" Copyright 2025 BBC.

6/10/2025,Article,News,Man charged over abortion drug in partner's drink,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/c0r1enk0x0eo,"A man in Texas has been charged with murder after he allegedly slipped an abortion drug into his pregnant girlfriend's drink. Justin Anthony Banta was arrested on Friday after a months-long investigation into his former girlfriend's accusation that he gave her the Plan C pill (known as an abortion drug) without her knowledge, according to police in the US state. Mr Banta's ex-partner said when she disclosed her pregnancy last year, he had offered to cover the cost of an abortion, but she expressed her desire to keep the baby. Police said after meeting with Mr Banta in a coffee shop, she experienced heavy bleeding and visited the emergency room, but lost her baby a few days later. Mr Banta was also charged with tampering with physical evidence and is awaiting prosecution, according to the Parker County Sheriff's Office. Police said Mr Banta's former girlfriend was around six-weeks pregnant when she went for a check up with her doctor, who told her the baby was healthy and had ""a strong heartbeat"" and vital signs. ""Later that same day, the victim reported she met Banta at a coffee shop... where she expressed her suspicion that Banta had secretly added abortion-inducing pills to her drink without her knowledge or permission,"" the sheriff's office said in a statement. Mr Banta's former girlfriend also said he suggested they buy the Plan C abortion drug online after she disclosed her pregnancy. Following an interview with Mr Banta, police collected his mobile phone, but later discovered ""crucial evidence relating to the case"" was deleted, they said. Investigators said they believed Mr Banta, who worked in IT at the US Department of Justice, later accessed his phone remotely and performed a ""reset"". An arrest warrant for him was then obtained, and Mr Banta was charged last week with capital murder and tampering with physical evidence. Police said the cases against Mr Banta remained active and ongoing. Texas has some of the most restrictive abortion laws in the US, banning all abortions except in dire medical circumstances. The state introduced a law in 2022 that carries civil and criminal penalties for those who perform abortions. A law in 2021 also bans the termination of pregnancies after a baby's heartbeat is detected, but does make exceptions for medical emergencies. Copyright 2025 BBC.

6/10/2025,Article,News,Foreign Office staff told to consider resigning if they disagree over Gaza ,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/cy8nzx1475ro,"More than 300 Foreign Office staff who raised concerns about potential UK ""complicity"" in Israel's conduct in Gaza were told if they profoundly disagreed with government policy they could consider resigning. The staff letter, seen by the BBC, was sent to Foreign Secretary David Lammy last month. In it, officials questioned the UK's continued arms sales and what they called a ""stark… disregard for international law"" by Israel. The Foreign Office said it had systems for staff to raise concerns and added the government had ""rigorously applied international law"" in relation to the war in Gaza. The reply to the staff letter was sent from Sir Oliver Robbins and Nick Dyer, the two most senior civil servants in the Foreign Office. They told the signatories: ""[I]f your disagreement with any aspect of government policy or action is profound your ultimate recourse is to resign from the Civil Service. This is an honourable course."" The response was met with ""outrage"" according to one official who signed the letter.  ""[There is] frustration and a deep sense of disappointment that the space for challenge is being further shut down,"" said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity. The officials' letter signed on 16 May was at least the fourth such document sent by concerned civil servants to ministers and Foreign Office managers since late 2023.  The BBC understands the signatories represent a wide range of expertise across Foreign Office departments, embassies and missions including in London and overseas. The letters have reflected the scale of the civilian death toll in Gaza, Israel's restrictions on aid supply and Israeli settlement expansion and settler violence in the occupied West Bank, among other issues.  Staff are also said to feel disquiet that many of their warnings have not been acted on, and those whose jobs it is to implement decisions could be liable in any future legal proceedings against the UK government. The 16 May letter said: ""In July 2024, staff expressed concern about Israel's violations of international humanitarian law and potential UK government complicity. In the intervening period, the reality of Israel's disregard for international law has become more stark."" It went on to list the killing by Israeli forces of 15 humanitarian workers in March and Israel's suspension of all aid to Gaza in the same month ""leading many experts and humanitarian organisations to accuse Israel of using starvation as a weapon of war"".  It said the UK government's position had contributed to ""the erosion of global norms"", citing continued weapons exports and the visit to London in April by Israel's foreign minister Gideon Sa'ar ""despite concerns about violations of international law"".  It added that, ""supported by the Trump administration, the Israeli government has made explicit plans for the forcible transfer of Gaza's population"". In their response on 29 May, Sir Oliver and Mr Dyer told the staff the department wanted to see ""healthy challenge"" as part of the policy-making process and had already set up a ""bespoke Challenge Board"" and regular listening sessions with employees to hear concerns in this policy area.  They wrote that officials were entitled to their personal views, but added it ""might be helpful"" to ""remind"" them of mechanisms available to those uncomfortable with policy.  It went on to list a series of ways staff could raise issues, before adding that resignation was an ""ultimate recourse"" and ""honourable course"" for those with profound disagreements over government policy.  ""[T]he bargain at the heart of the British Civil Service is that we sign up to deliver the policies of the government of the day wholeheartedly, within the limits imposed by the law and the Civil Service Code,"" it said. A former official who saw the correspondence described the response as ""obfuscation"". ""This… simply provides the government with supposed 'plausible deniability' for enabling breaches of international law,"" said the former official who also spoke on condition of anonymity. They said that the FCDO and broader civil service seemed unable to learn the lessons of the past, referring to the 2016 Chilcot Report recommendations following the inquiry into the Iraq war.  Chilcot criticised the emergence of an ""ingrained belief"" within senior levels of the UK policy community over the existence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. His recommendations led to civil service reforms designed to challenge ""groupthink"" and empowering officials to speak out about policy concerns. Mark Smith resigned from the Foreign Office last year in protest at arm sales to Israel.  He told the BBC's World at One there were ""proper pathways and procedures"" for raising concerns but added: ""The reality is that I went through every single one of those procedures and was completely ignored, completely shunned. ""Obviously, we have a duty to respect our democratically elected representatives... however, we also have a duty to hold the government to account.  ""We are one of the pillars of our democracy and it is absolutely beholden to us to say when things are wrong, to say when things are unlawful."" The UK government's position is that Israel is ""at risk"" of breaching humanitarian law. Israel has previously said it operates according to international law. Palestinian rights groups have rejected this, taking evidence to several legal cases brought internationally. In September, Foreign Secretary David Lammy announced the suspension of around 30 arms export licenses to Israel, out of a total of about 350, citing a ""clear risk"" they might be used to commit or facilitate a serious violation of international humanitarian law.  It came weeks before the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued arrest warrants for Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former defence minister Yoav Gallant as well as the military commander of Hamas.  Israel's government has consistently rejected allegations it has committed war crimes in Gaza, calling the ICC's decision ""antisemitic"", while the US Department of State last week announced sanctions against four ICC judges for ""transgressions against the United States and Israel"". In a statement, the FCDO said the job of civil servants was to deliver on government policies and provide professional, impartial advice as set out in the Civil Service Code.  ""There are systems in place which allow them to raise concerns if they have them,"" said the spokesperson. They added: ""Since day one, this government has rigorously applied international law in relation to the war in Gaza. One of our first acts in government was to suspend export licences that could be used by the Israeli Defence Forces in Gaza…  ""We have suspended direct exports of F-35 parts for use by Israel, and we categorically do not export any bombs or ammunition which could be used in Gaza,"" added the spokesperson. On 19 May the UK issued a joint statement with France and Canada threatening ""concrete actions"" against Israel if it did not stop its renewed military offensive and lift aid restrictions.

6/10/2025,Article,News,World Bank predicts worst decade for global growth since 60s,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/cg4v9nr23r7o,"The global economy will see the slowest decade for global growth since the 1960s as the effect of Donald Trump's tariffs are felt, the World Bank has predicted. Nearly two thirds of countries in the world had their growth forecasts cut from the bank's last set of predictions six months ago. The bank predicts global growth of only 2.3% in 2025, which is 0.4% lower than was forecast in January, and for 2027, it predicts growth of 2.6% Japan, Europe and the US were among those downgraded in the bank's twice yearly report. The bank's last set of forecasts in January were made before Donald Trump took office. Since then, his introduction of a universal 10% tariff on all imports into the US, as well as higher tariffs on steel and aluminium, caused financial markets to plunge in early April. A trade ruling found the bulk of his global tariffs to be illegal in May, although the Trump administration won an appeal to keep them in place for now. The World Bank downgraded its growth forecast for the US in both 2025 and 2026, because of escalating trade tensions rattling investor confidence as well as private consumption. However, it not downgrade the US's main rival, China, which the bank said had enough financial stability to weather the ""significant headwinds"" from global political uncertainty. ""Against the backdrop of heightened policy uncertainty and increased trade barriers, the global economic context has become more challenging,"" the report said, adding that more ""sentiment-sapping policy uncertainty"" would come because of the potential for ""further rapid shifts"" in trade-restrictive moves by countries. The bank said there would be further cuts in growth if the US increased tariffs, and warned of rising inflation. Tariffs could lead to ""global trade seizing up in the second half of this year, accompanied by a widespread collapse in confidence, surging uncertainty and turmoil in financial markets,"" the report said. However, it stopped short of predicting a global recession, saying the chances of that were less than 10%. The report comes after the OECD also downgraded its outlook for the world economy. It said global growth is now expected to slow to a ""modest"" 2.9%, down from a previous forecast of 3.1%. In the mean time, a new round of talks aimed at resolving the trade war between the US and China has taken place in central London.  Copyright 2025 BBC.

6/10/2025,Article,News,"We quit our jobs, sold our home twice and spent 10 years fighting for the truth",https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/cdxn5d4dzrwo,"Warning: This article contains upsetting details and reference to suicide There didn't seem to be anything out of the ordinary when Jane Figueiredo spoke to her daughter that night on the phone. ""Alice asked me to bring her some snacks for the next time we visited,"" Jane says. But that call, at 22:15 on 6 July 2015, was the last conversation they ever had. Around three hours later, Jane and her husband, Max, were being driven to hospital in a police car at speed. They had been told their daughter was gravely ill. Alice had got into a communal toilet at Goodmayes Hospital, in Ilford, east London, where she was a mental health patient, and taken her own life. She was just months away from her 23rd birthday. On Monday, almost 10 years later, the North East London NHS Foundation Trust (NELFT), which runs the hospital, and Benjamin Aninakwa, the manager of the ward Alice was on, were found guilty of health and safety failings over her death. The jury decided not enough was done by NELFT, or Aninakwa, to prevent Alice from killing herself. It's taken a decade of battling by Alice's parents to uncover the truth about how the 22-year-old was able to take her own life in a unit where she was meant to be safe. They twice had to sell their home, quit their jobs and have worked full-time on the case. The jury deliberated for 24 days to reach all the verdicts, after which time the Trust was cleared of the more serious charge of corporate manslaughter, while Aninakwa, 53, of Grays, Essex, was cleared of gross negligence manslaughter. During the seven-month trial, we sat a few seats away from the family. They've sometimes been overwhelmed, leaving the court angry or in tears, as they felt their voices - and that of Alice - were not being heard. Now, Jane hopes the verdicts will bring major change to psychiatric care providers around the country. ""You need to do far, far better to stop failing those people who you have a duty of care to,"" she said after the verdict. Weeks earlier, in mid-March this year, the Figueiredos were living in a hotel room in central London. While folding their clothes, they spoke to the BBC during a break in the trial, which was already running months longer than expected. They had been living out of suitcases since the end of October, when court hearings began. Even before the pain of hearing evidence about their daughter's death, they said simply existing like this had been a huge challenge.  For the couple, it was important to be at the Old Bailey every day in person - no matter the cost - because they felt this was their only chance to see the Trust held to account for their daughter's death. Alice was born in 1992, the second of three daughters. She was a bright and energetic child, and often the centre of attention. She loved music, poetry, reading and, in particular, art. Family and friends say she had a big personality. ""She had a really deeply thoughtful, sensitive, caring nature. She was really kind. She was really generous,"" remembers Jane. As a child, Alice started to develop what became an eating disorder, and by 15 she was showing symptoms of severe depression and was admitted to a mental health unit. In the following years she would be hospitalised on many more occasions. In 2012, then 19, she was admitted to the Hepworth Ward, at Goodmayes Hospital, for the first time. It is an inpatient mental health unit for women, run by NELFT. She was admitted there a total of seven times over the following three years. ""She needed safety. She was a risk to herself,"" says Jane. ""It was a question of, somehow managing the crisis and trusting the medical profession to make the right decisions,"" adds Max, Alice's stepfather. Between admissions, Alice had long periods when hospital treatment wasn't needed. She had been applying to go to university and was planning a brighter future. But on 13 February 2015, as her mental health took a serious turn for the worse, Alice was admitted to the Hepworth Ward for what would prove to be the final time. Three days later, Alice was detained on the unit under section three of the Mental Health Act to undergo treatment for her own safety and could not leave without her consultant's permission. Alice was put on one of the highest observation levels, reserved for patients at most risk of harming themselves. It meant a member of staff had to stay within arm's length of her 24-hours-a-day. In a letter to staff just over a month into her admission, Max and Jane wrote: ""She cannot contain the sense of sheer torment, intense depression and overwhelming despair she is experiencing."" The manager for Hepworth Ward at the time was Benjamin Aninakwa. The now 53-year-old had been working on the unit since it opened, in 2011. He was in charge of the unit during each of Alice's previous admissions, so knew her well. But other things on the ward had changed. The nurse and the consultant, who had previously cared for Alice, had both moved on and there was a high level of temporary agency staff filling long-standing gaps in the rota. Her parents say Alice felt unsettled. ""I think it became clear that there was an element of chaos in the ward,"" says Max. Jane, who was a chaplain to the mental health trust, would visit Alice every day; Max, who worked for the NHS as an accountant, would stop by a few times a week, often with food. Alice told her parents that staff weren't carrying out observations properly. On one occasion, within the first fortnight of her admission, she said an agency health care assistant who was supposed to be staying close to her, was instead making a phone call. The family later saw an internal email saying Alice had been left alone while the care worker continued this conversation. In that time, Alice attempted to harm herself using her bedding. The same email said that once the care assistant returned and found Alice she slapped her. ""Nothing was done about that. There was no safeguarding,"" says Jane. During the trial, the court heard that Alice had attempted to harm herself on at least 39 occasions during her admission - many of these involved plastic bags or bin liners. Even though they were in the dark about many of these incidents, her parents became so concerned they started raising it with staff at the hospital, in person and in several emails. On 16 May, three months into Alice's stay, Jane emailed the consultant for Hepworth Ward, Dr Anju Soni, about an incident of self-harm with a plastic bag in which Alice lost consciousness. ""If it had been a few minutes longer before she was found, the outcome could have been very different - she could have died,"" she wrote. The court heard that many of these incidents were not recorded properly by staff, nor communicated to the family. After several months, Alice's depression began to ease. In June, her observation levels were lowered to reflect her progress, and they were eventually reduced to hourly checks. She was able to leave the unit for short periods, even going to a Fleetwood Mac concert with her boyfriend Andrew. But her eating disorder remained a serious challenge, and she was still under section. She asked to be moved to a specialist unit to help her recovery. On 30 June, Alice complained of chest pain and was transferred to nearby King George Hospital. When she came back to Hepworth Ward a couple of days later, the court heard she was told she was too frail to go on planned leave. Her family remember intense fluctuations in her mood around this time. They say she was frustrated that her eating disorder wasn't improving, little progress was being made on her moving to another unit and she was getting bullied by other patients on the ward. On 4 July, three days before Alice died, Jane and Max went to visit her. The eating disorder was taking its toll. They could see their daughter was struggling. ""She sat there almost in silence, tears were rolling down her face,"" remembers Jane. Late on the night of 6 July, Alice and her boyfriend exchanged messages with each other, talking about their love of Bob Dylan's music. At 23:30 he wrote: ""I can't stop thinking about you, x."" The court heard that around that time Alice had asked to speak to a care assistant she got on with. The care assistant was called away to an emergency elsewhere in the hospital. When she returned to Hepworth Ward she looked for Alice. She eventually found her slumped in the communal toilet. Errors by two nurses on duty on Hepworth Ward slowed the arrival of an on-call doctor and paramedics. Alice was eventually taken to another hospital where she died. ""It's a moment where your entire life has changed and will never be the same. That's what we have had to learn to live with,"" says Jane. Still dealing with the devastating shock of losing their daughter, the Figueiredos set about piecing together what had happened to her. The Trust produced a Serious Incident (SI) report. These investigations are meant to help prevent similar incidents happening. But the Figueiredos felt it was incomplete and the Trust was avoiding accepting responsibility for Alice's death. Whatever their concerns, the report contained information that was new and troubling. It mentioned 13 incidents in which Alice had used a plastic bag or bin bag to self-harm. ""I was shocked and horrified when I saw that,"" says Jane. ""I thought, [the Trust] knew this had happened, and [they] still let her carry on doing this, and she died,"" she says. The family felt the risk of plastic bags for patients on an acute mental health ward, particularly Alice, should have been obvious. During a previous admission to Hepworth Ward the year before, Alice tried to harm herself using plastic bags on at least three occasions. In November 2015, sensing there was more to uncover, the couple holed themselves up in a hotel in Lindisfarne, off the Northumbria coast, and started piecing together their suspicions. ""We went very quickly into actually writing our own report and sending it to all the authorities that we knew of,"" says Max. They used their insiders' knowledge from working in the health service, to get their report in front of senior NHS people and regulators. They wrote to Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, then head of London's Metropolitan Police. He wrote back and a police investigation into what happened to Alice was launched. The Nursing and Midwifery Council launched inquiries into several of the nurses involved in Alice's care. Even with the police involved, the Figueiredos kept digging, getting hold of as much documentation as they possibly could. When they weren't able to get documents through official routes, they'd find other ways to get them, working like seasoned investigators. Once they had them, they'd analyse them and produce detailed reports that they sent to the police and regulators. ""If I could discover something that would be helpful to their investigation. I would try to do that. We were a parallel investigation,"" says Jane. All this digging came at a financial cost. ""We were in our 50s, we both stopped working and actually sold our house and lived off that to be able to do this,"" says Jane. The emotional price was even higher. ""You can't underestimate or even find the words to say, the toll that that takes on you. It's profoundly re-traumatising,"" she says. There were further shocks to come in Alice's medical notes, which showed gaps in the hospital's official SI report. They had been told Alice had attempted to self-harm with plastic bags on 13 occasions, in fact it happened at least 18 times. Most of these incidents weren't recorded in logs as they should have been. ""It still shocks us to the core today,"" says Max. On the unit, plastic bags were not used in the bins in patient bedrooms for safety reasons, but they were in a few communal locations, including a toilet that was often left unlocked. Alice used these bags to self-harm on multiple occasions, including the incident that led to her death. The trial heard there was little evidence that ward manager Benjamin Aninakwa made any attempt to restrict access to those bin bags, despite the issue being raised with him, and it appearing in Alice's care plan. He did not appear as a witness in court but told police the toilet door was locked and he had been overruled when he tried to remove the bin bags. The court heard there were no emails or evidence in Alice's clinical notes and records to corroborate this. A Care Quality Commission inspection in April 2016, the year after Alice's death, found bin bags still being used on the unit. The bags were eventually removed. The court heard that around the time Alice was admitted to the hospital for the final time, the Trust was carrying out a ""scoping exercise"", which looked at removing all plastic bin bags from the hospital's wards. It was revealed a bin which didn't need a plastic liner had been considered – it would have cost just £1.26. ""NELFT placed more value on their rubbish bins than they did on my daughter's life,"" says Jane. In a statement, the Trust said: ""Our thoughts are with Alice's family and loved ones, who lost her at such a young age. We extend our deepest sympathy for the pain and heartbreak they have suffered this past 10 years. ""We will reflect on the verdict and its implications, both for the trust and mental health provision more broadly as we continue to work to develop services for the communities we serve."" Jane and Max Figueiredo say they wanted to hold those at the Trust to account, but that they also wanted change for the future. But there will be no celebration at Monday's verdicts. ""Nothing will ever bring Alice back to us and we will never stop thinking of her and missing her,"" says Jane. ""There's always one place empty at our table, one very special voice silent that we long to hear in our conversations.""

6/10/2025,Article,News,Ed Sheeran says he identifies culturally as Irish,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/cn84e5xe4q3o,"Singer-songwriter Ed Sheeran has said he identifies culturally as Irish despite being born and raised in England. Brought up in Suffolk, the Galway Girl singer's dad hails from Belfast. ""I class my culture as Irish. I think that's what I grew up with,"" he told The Louis Theroux Podcast. ""My dad's family is... he's got seven brothers and sisters. We'd spend all of our holidays in Ireland. My first musical experiences were in Ireland, I grew up with trad music in the house. So I identify culturally as Irish, but I was obviously born and raised in Britain.""  ""I don't overthink it but I do feel like my culture is something that I'm really proud of and grew up with and want to express,"" he added. ""And I feel like just because I was born in Britain doesn't necessarily mean that I have to just be (British), there's loads of people I know that are half this or quarter this."" He added: ""I don't think there's any rules to it. It should be how you feel and how you were raised and what you lean into."" Asked if he gets ""a lot of love"" in Ireland, he said: ""I'd say it's basically my second home, musically. I'd say Ireland is the place that I am most successful musically.""  Sheeran is married to Cherry Seaborn and the couple have two children. He also spoke to Theroux about the difficulties of fame and having to have security for his family. He said that for him personally, ""it's kind of the part of the normal of being in the public eye"" but that is was different when it came to his wife and children. ""I'm very, very private about my children's image... I can't take them to zoos or parks or anything really without someone trying to film them. ""There are times where the normal parts of life I kind of mourn for and wish I could push my kid on a swing in a public park and it not be weird, you know?"" He said: ""People go, well that's the trade-off. But my kids have not signed up to that."" He added it was sometimes tricky when he was flying as he usually travels on commercial flights due to environmental concerns. ""We're flying back on Ryanair from a gig in Italy last year but all of my fans who'd been at the gig were flying back! ""I like the environment, I like trees. I'd find it hard to justify. No one's perfect. When we're doing intense promo trips, there will be the odd time [taking a private jet]"", he told Theroux.  Speaking about his music, Sheeran said: ""The two joys of my life professionally are writing songs and performing. I hate releasing music. I find the whole process quite stressful. ""You love the songs so much and then suddenly you're putting them out there, and that might change your relationship with them if other people don't like them. And I'm trying my hardest not to let that happen."" He also mused on his relationship with success. ""I kind of feel I had my peak with [the album] Divide and I'm kind of coasting now. I don't know if I'll ever get back up there again but [when I had] that level of fame, that was my unhappiest [time]. ""I'm much happier with the balance I've got now."" After releasing two acoustic albums in 2023, Sheeran's upcoming pop album, Play, his eighth studio album, will be released in September. Copyright 2025 BBC.

6/10/2025,Article,Culture,Five works that reveal Banksy's hidden philosophy,https://www.bbc.com//culture/article/20250602-five-works-that-reveal-the-philosophy-of-banksy,"Banksy's new mural in Marseille is not the first image he has connected to the history of ideas. From Plato to Foucault, a Banksy expert reveals the philosophy behind these popular artworks. Which is the real you, the person you are now or the one you are capable of becoming? It's a heady question, to be sure, and not one you would expect to be confronted with while strolling down a street in Marseille in the waning days of May. Yet it's precisely the existential dilemma that Banksy, who once asserted ""being yourself is overrated"" – has surreptitiously installed in a cloistered stretch of the quiet Rue Félix Fregier, the site of a new work – the latest installment in the elusive artist's decades-long career as a provocative philosophical prankster.  For more than 30 years, Banksy has spiked many of his most iconic works – from his girl reaching hopelessly for a heart-shaped balloon to his masked rioter hurling a bouquet of flowers – with barbed allusions to Old Masters, from Michelangelo to Monet, Vermeer to Van Gogh. But there's more. Beneath his stealthy stencils lies a deep and deliberate engagement with the history of ideas as well, from classical Stoicism to postmodern deconstructionism. On 29 May, Banksy posted on Instagram a photo of his first new piece in more than five months, piquing the internet's interest by withholding its precise location. Discovered shortly thereafter in the major port city in southern France, Marseille, the mural is, at first glance, deceptively simple: a tall silhouette of a lighthouse spray-painted on to a blank beige urban wall; a rusting street bollard positioned nearby; and a painted shadow stretching across the pavement, joining the real-world object to its augmented, if two-dimensional, echo. Stencilled across the black lighthouse are the words: ""I want to be what you saw in me.""  Anyone keen to find a source for the ideas that inform Banksy's new work needs merely to flip open any history of philosophy to Plato's seminal allegory of the cave (from the Fourth-Century BC treatise The Republic), then flip the ancient metaphor on its head. In Plato's parable, prisoners chained inside a cave mistake shadows on the wall for reality, unaware of the truer forms that cast them outside. But here, Banksy, being Banksy, baits us by switching the set-up, reversing the relationship between essence and shadow. In Banksy's mural, the drab bollard casts not a diminished imitation of itself, but something far grander – a lighthouse, a symbol of illumination and guidance. Here, it's the silhouette, not reality, that's true. Banksy's inversion urges us to ask where reality really resides: in what is, or in what might be? His poignant phrase – ""I want to be what you saw in me"" – is alluringly elastic. Is this the bollard dreaming of being more than it appears? Or the shadow wishing to become light? Or is it all of us – Banksy included – struggling to live up to the better versions imagined by those who believe in us? The answer is surely yes to all of the above. And it's a yes too to the question: 'is this new work a lamp capable of shining light on further levels of meaning in Banksy?' What follows is a brief look back at some of the artist's best-known works and how they too are invigorated by, and often upend, many of the most important philosophical tenets – both social and intellectual – that underwrite who we are and who we might be. Banksy's new mural in Marseille is not the first to be accompanied by an affecting caption connecting the piece to the history of ideas. Among his most famous murals, Girl with Balloon, which portrays a child reaching towards a heart-shaped balloon drifting away from her, first appeared in 2002 in various locations in London, including on the South Bank, alongside the consoling assertion, ""there is always hope"". That conviction, which fuels the ceaseless striving for an ideal that is seemingly unobtainable in the mural (there's no way that balloon is coming back) rhymes richly with aspects of 19th-Century German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer's ideas concerning an unquenchable and irrational ""Will"" as a fundamental force that drives humanity. When, years later, Banksy mischievously concealed a remote-controlled shredder in the frame of a version of Girl with Balloon that came up for auction in 2018, and sensationally destroyed the work before the eyes of aghast auction-goers, he succeeded in upping the ante on Schopenhauer's belief in the futility of desire by boldly manifesting it himself. Where there's a will there's a fray. Banksy's famous mural of a masked man frozen forever in the instant before he unleashes not a brick or a bomb but a bouquet of flowers may seem, at first blush, to exemplify a pacifist's commitment to peaceful disobedience. The work appears to echo the precepts of Mahatma Gandhi's Satyagraha – a philosophy of non-violence that the Indian ethicist coined in 1919. Banksy's fully flexed figure, incongruously armed with a fistful of beauty, appears to epitomise Gandhi's insistence on wielding moral, not physical, strength. Doesn't it? Or has Banksy slyly subverted the philosophical assertion of pacifistic force by portraying his hero as an enraged rioter? The figure's anger has not been tempered by an appeal to the higher ideals of beauty and truth. Instead, those ideals have been weaponised by Banksy. Here, beauty and truth are not disarming, they are devastatingly explosive. Banksy's mural in Marseille employs a tried-and-true technique to ensure the work protrudes into the urban space in which we'll encounter it – elevating its philosophical potential from something flimsy and flat to something undeniably urgent. It's a tactic he used in a 2007 work that appeared near London's Oxford Street in which he depicts a boy atop a precariously high ladder, spray-painting the penetrating observation that we are ""One Nation Under CCTV"" in outlandishly outsized letters. Also portrayed within the mural is a uniformed officer and his obedient police dog who surveil the young vandal, while above them all an actual CCTV camera, presumably recording everything, juts out from the wall. The endless layers of surveillance-within-surveillance to which the work attests – as we watch the state watch an officer watch the boy – captures with uncanny precision the philosophical contours of the vast and all-encompassing prison machine in which the French poststructural philosopher Michel Foucault believed everyone in society was now irredeemably enmeshed. In Foucault's study Discipline and Punish: The Birth of the Prison, he resuscitates a blueprint for a prison proposed by the British utilitarian philosopher Jeremy Bentham at the end of the 18th Century, ""The Panopticon"" (meaning ""all seeing""), and uses it as a menacing metaphor for how no one can escape the perniciously penetrating eye of the panoptical state.  Banksy's witty 2014 work Mobile Lovers shines a chilling light on the state of contemporary relationships. The mural depicts a couple whose almost affectionate embrace is interrupted by the deeper fondness they have for the warm glow of their smartphones. The French existentialist philosopher Simone de Beauvoir, who died in 1986, may not have lived long enough to witness the emergence of mobiles. Yet her profoundly influential 1947 book The Ethics of Ambiguity – published exactly 60 years before the iPhone was launched in 2007 – with its exploration of the devastation that detachment and disconnection can wreak on the realisation of our truest selves, is profoundly proleptic of our modern predicament. To be free, de Beauvoir insisted, requires a deep attentiveness to each other. She believed in the authenticity of human encounters, without which life is a futile performance, dimly lit by disposable devices, rather than something profound and meaningful.  How Banksy Saved Art History by Kelly Grovier, published by Thames & Hudson, is out now. -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.

6/10/2025,Article,Travel,Is there such a thing as American cuisine?,https://www.bbc.com//travel/article/20250606-felicity-cloakes-american-food-odyssey,"For her new book, Peach Street to Lobster Lane, British food writer Felicity Cloake cycles across the US from coast to coast in search of a definition for its national cuisine. Gordon Ramsay famously credits his success in the US to Americans knowing nothing about good food. Felicity Cloake begs to differ.  In her new book, Peach Street to Lobster Lane, the award-winning British food writer sets out to challenge the stereotype of American food as deep-fried and cultureless. ""On this trip, I'm determined to find this unicorn, cover it with ketchup and pickles and have it for lunch,"" she writes.  Over the course of 10 weeks and several thousand kilometres, she cycles coast to coast across the US, discovering independent restaurants, fusion cuisine and an attitude towards food she's seen nowhere else in the world. Her food-filled obsession takes her from San Francisco's most refined sourdough to the home of the hamburger in Columbus, Ohio. Along the way, she explores the source of Tabasco on Avery Island and feasts on crawfish on an accidental stop in Houston.  Her mission? To discover what, if anything, ties American cuisine together and to celebrate the creativity, history and heart she finds everywhere she goes.   We caught up with Cloake to talk about the good, the greasy and the gloriously surprising food that fuelled her adventures. Why did you decide to write a book about American food? I don't think my publisher will mind me saying that they were a bit reluctant, because the theme is a bit tricky. If you don't already love America and its cuisine, it's difficult to see beyond the top-line stereotypes of McDonalds, KFC, ridiculous eating competitions and too much on the plate. It doesn't sound very attractive. BBC.com's World's Table ""smashes the kitchen ceiling"" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future. But I was thinking about the amazing Mexican food and all the different immigrant cuisines there. There's much more of a sense of possibility, fun and flexibility when it comes to cooking in America. They don't feel so hide-bound to tradition for a lot of things as we do in Europe. And that was so exciting to me; uncovering this really playful attitude to food that manifests in potentially fun but unhealthy things like, you know, a cheeseburger that has doughnuts instead of a bun.  There is some fantastic food and fantastic produce in the US, but it just gets sort of swept under the carpet because we only see this cartoonish version. For me, there's always been a glamour about America, which I find hard to shake. It's a sense of ""wow, everything's like it is in the movies"". And it is!  You spent 10 weeks cycling across the US in search of the best food. Why did you decide to travel by bike? I thought: I've cycled in Italy, I've cycled in France. How different can it be? And then when I got closer to the trip, I was more concerned. Everyone I knew tried to put me off. But I actually found that it was a great place to cycle. I did end up riding down a six-lane freeway in LA, but there are lots of little roads too. It's a bit like France in that way; because the country is so vast, the smaller roads tend to be quite quiet. It gave me access to a side of America that I hadn’t seen before because I'd always been in a car, passing through at speed. Did you discover a culinary style that is distinctly American?  Yes! I think it centres around the idea of playfulness and a lack of concern for tradition and the ""right"" way of doing things. That's what annoys so many people from the more established and conservative food cultures about American food; that's why they are so dismissive. It's a fun place to eat and they've got some great produce. They don't overcomplicate it either.  I had some brilliant farm-to-table food in New England in particular. When American food is good, it's up there with the world's best. People need to look beyond the American businesses that are on their local high streets to find real American cuisine. It's a very fun place to eat. What was your favourite meal? I find mashups of unexpected food cultures really exciting. My best meal was at a restaurant in San Antonio where a Taiwanese American chef was making the Tex-Mex food she had grown up with, under Taiwanese influences. So it was things like an orange chicken fried steak and mochi hush puppies. I found that exciting because it's not something that you would ever find somewhere else. Tex-Mex is seen as a mash up in itself, and to add a third culture to the mix just feels mind blowing. There was so much creativity and fun, but it was also delicious. It was clever cooking but it was light-hearted as well, and I love that. What surprised you most about the trip? America is expensive! Ten years ago, travelling in America was very cheap. Food was cheap, motels were cheap. But that is no longer the case – and it was a bit of a shock to the system. I bought a grapefruit in Ohio that cost $2.99 – it would have cost 60p in the UK, and it had surely been grown in Florida. So that was extraordinary. Then the whole tipping culture thing… it's just a really expensive place to be.  What struck you most about the differences between English and American food culture? It was difficult getting food that wasn't processed in some way. It's not that people aren't health conscious, it's more that the stuff being marketed as health food is at odds with what I would regard as healthy food. It's very processed, it's packaged. I found it hard to find an unprocessed fruit or vegetable.  More like this: • The truth about the US' most iconic food • Is the future of French cheese at stake? • Tucson: The US's ancient, underrated culinary capital Then the throwaway nature of everything really bothered me. It's hard to recycle there. And I don't get the same enjoyment from eating from a plastic plate. There are a few issues surrounding food that made me proud of how much British food has changed. What was your biggest learning from the trip? I hadn't appreciated that all stereotypes of American food in my mind – the hotdogs, burgers and ice cream sundaes – were all imports as well. I had thought about Mexican food and Korean food, and then the rest was American food. But I realised that no; all the food bar Native American food heritage – which is being reclaimed these days – all of it is an import. I would love to go to the Lakes region and learn more about that food culture. There's popcorn, jerky and wild rice, although that's more of an ingredient than a dish. Overall, it's a much more exciting cuisine than I imagined it would be. As different waves of people come in and mix, there's more to see and try. It's evolving and changing – it feels like boundless possibility. Is there anything you'd do differently if you had the chance to do it again? I do slightly regret that I didn't eat any really trashy fast food that we don't get here yet. There is a lot more that I could have found. Another odd regret is that I didn't eat more. I was obsessed with the idea that I was going to die if I didn't eat enough vegetables. I ate a lot of salads out of the bag. I think I might have been a bit overanxious with that, looking back. And if it wasn't for my dog, I would have gone for longer. I would have liked to have spent more time in Texas, for sure. There's so much more to explore.

6/10/2025,Article,Travel,Eight rare juices you can only try in the Amazon,https://www.bbc.com//travel/article/20250529-eight-rare-juices-you-can-only-try-in-the-amazon,"Far from smoothie bars and powdered sachets, these wild Amazonian juices are pulped just hours after picking – making them rich in flavour and cultural meaning. The Amazon is not only the world's largest and most biodiverse ecosystem – it's also one of the most delicious. Among the thousands of native species, around 220 trees are known to bear edible fruit, many of which never leave the jungle. Some are too delicate to export, while others are little known beyond the communities that have nurtured them for generations. But along the Amazon River and its tributaries – from Peru's misty highland jungle to the floodplains of northern Brazil – travellers can find market stalls and cafe counters brimming with thick, vibrant juices that capture the flavour of the forest. These are the fruits you're unlikely to find bottled or powdered at home, often pulped just hours after harvest, served chilled in the tropical heat and prized not only for their nutrients but for their rich textures and sharp tangs. Here are eight juices worth seeking out, whether for their bold flavours, cultural significance or the thrill of trying something new. On the eastern slopes of the Andes, where rivers cascade in dramatic waterfalls into the Amazon Basin, travellers will find the aguaje fruit of the Moriche palm. In the small Peruvian city of Tingo Maria, markets are piled high with silver trays of the armadillo-like fruit. Locals soak them in water for a day or two, before peeling the brown armour to reveal an intensely orange flesh. The pulp is soaked, mashed and transformed into aguajina – a thick and custardy drink that tastes like cross between pumpkin pie and flan. BBC.com's World's Table ""smashes the kitchen ceiling"" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future. Some locals say that the fruit contains oestrogen compounds and men should be careful of drinking too much of it, though there is little scientific evidence. ""The aguajina is very useful – for the bone, for the skin, for the complexion – especially for women,"" says Gianina Pujay, an aguajinera who sells the drink across from Tingo Maria's fruit market. In the same region, the cocona fruit, a tropical relative of the common tomato, yields a tangy juice that tastes like a pineapple-papaya hybrid with a thick, almost oily body.  ""Many Amazonian fruits are consumed in juice form because their pulp is acidic, fibrous or difficult to eat raw, like the cocona,"" explains Miluska Carrasco, a researcher and nutritionist at Peru's Instituto de Investigación Nutricional, ""It's also a practical way to use them quickly before they spoil."" Descending from the verdant slopes of the Andes into the Amazon Basin, the rivers slow down and transform into thoroughfares of commercial activity. On the banks of the Ucayali River is the river port city of Pucallpa, the furthest Peru's road system will take you into the centre of the Amazon. Here, where container barges, passenger ships and canoes all move goods around the forest, camu camu is a must-drink juice.  The small, tart, plum-like fruit tastes like a sour strawberry with a hint of peach, and is a favourite of local juice vendors. ""[It] has more vitamin C than oranges,"" says Carrasco, ""[as well as] other bioactive compounds."" Where a navel orange provides about 6mg of vitamin C per 100g, the camu camu contains more than 2,000mg for the same amount of flesh.  The season for camu camu is short, however, typically between January and March, so take advantage of the fresh juice when it's available. Locals also eat the little plums with salt; just spit out the seeds.  In the heart of Brazil's vast Amazonas state, 700 miles east of Pucallpa as the toucan flies (and at least a week or more on a river boat), tucumã palms provide an orange fruit that's only in season from February to August. During this time, it's often eaten for breakfast with cassava flour and is a key ingredient in the state's signature x-caboquinho sandwich, where slices are layered with salty coalho cheese and sweet chunks of fried plantains. To make juice from the notoriously fibrous tucumã, vendors use peelers, blenders and sieves to reduce shavings of the fruit to a pulp and then filter out the lightly nutty liquid. According to Francisco Falcão, a farmer in the community of Bom Jesus in the Tefé National Forest, ""people say that tucumã is good to eat and improves sight and skin"". Indeed, the fruit is rich in both manganese and calcium. Where kiwi, which is relatively high in calcium, contains around 30mg of calcium per 100g, tucumã has been measured to contain around four times as much. Also in the Tefé region, ""there's a palm tree that people eat the fruit of,"" says Falcão. ""Pupunha is a plant that we harvest starting in December and ending February."" Spanish-speaking parts of the Amazon know this oily palm fruit as pejibaye or pijuayo, and it is a key source of natural fats as well as vitamin B1 and vitamin E.   The pupunha grow in clusters of orange and red acorn-shaped fruit. They cannot be eaten raw, but once boiled they make a filling snack akin to an oily sweet potato. The boiled fruits also produce a creamy orange juice once fully pulped. In Peru, forest communities ferment the pulp into a lightly alcoholic drink called chicha or masato – especially during times of harvest.    In Manaus, capital of the Amazonas, reliable refrigeration means locals and visitors can enjoy fruits in various forms. The thick shell of the cupuaçu contains a collection of seeds surrounded by a fleshy white pulp. That pulp can be transformed into silky, tangy juice. But lately, locals have been incorporating its juice into ice cream. Indeed, the rest of Brazil is catching on, with ice cream parlours in Rio de Janeiro now offering the flavour too. More like this: • Spain's 'white gold' super-drink • A decadent avocado smoothie to break the Ramadan fast • The Caribbean's cooling, healthy elixir for summer Cupuaçu tastes like a creamy pineapple – surprising given that it's a close relative of cacao. ""It's the same genus as cacao and people make cupulate [as opposed to chocolate from it],"" says Daniel Tregidgo, a researcher at Brazil's Mamirauá Institute for Sustainable Development. ""When you go to the markets there are huge piles of cupuaçu seeds. I look at that and I say that's hipster chocolate right there."" Why haven’t we heard of cupulate yet? In Tregidgo's opinion, ""It's a matter of investment. If you take something from the middle of Amazon and you try to get it out into the global market without being exploitative, it is a bit tricky."" Bars produced from cupuaçu have the flavour of chocolate but retain some of their citrus piquancy. In the Amazon delta, jenipapo is known for its traditional use as a blue dye and a temporary tattoo ink. The fruit itself, which grows all along Brazil's coast in addition to the Amazon, has a yellowish pulp that's a great source of vitamin B1 and zinc. While jenipapo can be consumed as a fresh juice that tastes a bit like dried apricots, try ordering licor de jenipapo, an infused cachaça liqueur served in small bars and botecos. While açaí has become a global wellness trend, the version served in the Amazon bears little resemblance to the frozen bowls found abroad. What many travellers don't realise is that there are seven distinct açaí palm species. Locals distinguish between açaí-do-Pará, açaí-do-mato and juçara, depending on region. In Belém, for example, vendors use pneumatic presses to extract the berry's thick, purplish pulp – sold in clear bags and consumed straight out of bowls with spoons, as if a purple gazpacho. Outside of its natural range in Brazil, the rest of the country enjoys the pulp prepared in yogurts and ice creams.  -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.  For more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.  Copyright 2025 BBC.

6/10/2025,Article,News,"Oceans cannot become 'wild west', warns UN chief",https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/c057qrd9eejo,"Unregulated mining in the deep sea should not be allowed to go ahead, the head of the United Nations has warned.  ""The deep sea cannot become the Wild West,"" UN Secretary General António Guterres said at the opening of the UN Oceans Conference in Nice, France. His words were echoed by French President Emmanuel Macron, who declared the ""oceans are not for sale"". The remarks appear to refer to the decision by President Trump in April to begin issuing permits for the extraction of critical minerals in international waters. There is increasing interest in extracting precious minerals from what are called metallic ""nodules"" that naturally occur on the seabed. But marine scientists are concerned about the harm that could be caused. ""The ocean is not for sale. We're talking about a common shared good,"" President Macron said. ""I think it's madness to launch predatory economic action that will disrupt the deep seabed, disrupt biodiversity, destroy it."" This issue is one of a number on the agenda in France, including over-fishing, plastic pollution and climate change. Over 2,000 of the world's scientists met last week to review the latest data on ocean health - they recommended to governments meeting this week that deep sea exploration be halted whilst further research be carried out on the impacts. More than 30 countries support this position and are calling for a moratorium - but President Trump has not rowed back on his executive order. A key aim of the UN oceans conference, which runs until Friday, is to get 60 countries to ratify a High Seas Treaty and thus bring it into force.  This agreement was made two years ago to put 30% of international waters into marine protected areas (MPAs) by 2030, in the hope it would preserve and help ecosystems recover. President Macron declared in his opening speech that an additional 15 had ratified but that only brings the total number to 47.  The UK government has not yet ratified the agreement, though on Monday it said a ban on a bottom ""destructive"" type of fishing that drags large nets along the seafloor could be extended across MPAs in England.  Even if enough countries sign there are concerns from environmentalists, including Sir David Attenborough, that there is nothing explicit in the Treaty to ban bottom trawling in these MPAs. Bottom trawling is one of the more destructive fishing practices that can lead to accidentally killing larger marine species.

6/3/2025,Article,News,How political chaos helped forge South Korea's presidential frontrunner,https://bbc.com/news/articles/c4gepwxzeqgo,"Before the events of 3 December 2024, South Korea's new president Lee Jae–myung's path to power was littered with obstacles. Ongoing legal cases, investigations for corruption and allegations of abusing power looked set to derail the former opposition leader's second presidential bid. Then a constitutional crisis changed everything. On that night, former president Yoon Suk Yeol's abortive attempt to invoke martial law set in motion a series of events that cleared the path for Lee. Exactly six months later, South Koreans have handed a win to the liberal Democratic Party candidate who worked his way up from a teenage factory-worker to the country's most powerful office. Lee had been projected to win in the run up to the election, and his final hurdle disappeared after the ruling party's candidate conceded in the early hours of the morning after election day. A rags-to-riches origin story combined with a bullish political style has made Lee into a divisive figure in South Korea. ""Lee Jae-myung's life has been full of ups and downs, and he often takes actions that stir controversy,"" Dr Lee Jun-han, professor of political science and international studies at Incheon National University, told the BBC. These actions typically included attempts at progressive reform – such as a pledge, made during his 2022 presidential campaign, to implement universal basic income scheme – which challenged the existing power structure and status quo in South Korea. ""Because of this, some people strongly support him, while others distrust or dislike him,"" Dr Lee said. ""He is a highly controversial and unconventional figure – very much an outsider who has made a name for himself in a way that doesn't fit traditional Democratic Party norms."" But in this campaign, he has moved closer to the centre, focusing on big business and emphasising the importance of ties with the US, ahead of trade negotiations with President Donand Trump. In a recent memoir, Lee described his childhood as ""miserable"".  Born in 1963 in a mountain village in Andong, Gyeongbuk Province, he was the fifth of five sons and two daughters, and - due to his family's difficult circumstances - skipped middle school to illegally enter the workforce. As a young factory worker, Lee suffered an industrial accident where his fingers got caught in a factory power belt, and at the age of 13 suffered a permanent injury to his arm after his wrist was crushed by a press machine. Lee later applied for and was allowed to sit entrance exams for high school and university, passing in 1978 and 1980 respectively. He went on to study law with a full scholarship, and passed the Bar Examination in 1986. In 1992, he married his wife Kim Hye-kyung, with whom he has two children. He worked as a human rights lawyer for almost two decades before entering politics in 2005, joining the social-liberal Uri Party, a predecessor of the Democratic Party of Korea and the ruling party at the time. While his poor upbringing has drawn scorn from members of South Korea's upper class, Lee's success in building his political career from the ground up has earned him support from working-class voters and those who feel disenfranchised by the political elite. He was elected mayor of Seongnam in 2010, rolling out a series of free welfare policies during his tenure, and in 2018 became governor of the broader Gyeonggi Province.  Lee would go on to receive acclaim for his response to the Covid-19 pandemic, during which he clashed with the central government due to his insistence on providing universal relief grants for all residents of the province. It was also during this time that Lee became the Democratic Party's final presidential candidate for the first time in October 2021 – losing by 0.76 percentage points. Less than a year later, in August 2022, he was elected as the party's leader. From that point on, Dr Lee says, Lee dialled back on the controversial, fire-and-brimstone approach for which he had become notorious – opting instead to play it safe and keep a low profile. ""After [Lee's] term as a governor, his reformist image faded somewhat as he focused more on his presidential ambitions,"" he said. ""Still, on certain issues – like addressing past wrongs [during the Japanese colonial era], welfare and corruption – he has built a loyal and passionate support base by taking a firm and uncompromising stance."" This uncompromising attitude has its detractors, with many members and supporters of the ruling People Power Party (PPP) viewing Lee as aggressive and abrasive in his approach.  Lee's political career has also been marred by a series of scandals – including a drink driving incident in 2004, disputes with relatives in the late 2010s and allegations of an extramarital affair that emerged in 2018. While in other parts of the world voters have shown forgiveness and even support for controversial politicians, in South Korea – a country that is still relatively conservative in what it expects of public figures – such scandals have not played well. In recent years, Lee's political ambitions have been saddled with even more pressing controversies - including the ongoing legal cases that continue to hang over him, threatening to hamstring if not scuttle his career. One of these concerned a string of high-profile charges, including corruption, bribery and breach of trust, associated with a land development project in 2023.  Another, perhaps more critical legal battle involved allegations that Lee made a knowingly false statement during a debate in the last presidential campaign. During the debate, which aired on South Korean television in December 2021, Lee denied personally knowing Kim Moon-ki, a key figure in a corruption-ridden land development scandal who had taken his own life just days earlier. Prosecutors alleged that claim was false, thus violating the Public Official Election Act, and in November 2024 Lee was convicted of the false statements charge and given a one-year suspended prison sentence.  Then, in March, an appeals court cleared him of the charges – only for that ruling to be overturned by South Korea's Supreme Court. At the time of writing, the case is still awaiting a verdict. Other threats against Lee's future political ambitions posed a more fatal danger. In January 2024, while answering questions from reporters outside the construction site of a planned airport in Busan, Lee was stabbed in the neck by a man who had approached him asking for an autograph.  The injury to Lee's jugular vein, though requiring extensive surgery, was not critical - but he campaigned for this election behind bulletproof glass, wearing a bulletproof vest, surrounded by agents carrying ballistic briefcases.  The assailant, who had written an eight-page manifesto and wanted to ensure that Lee never became president, was sentenced to 15 years in prison. The attack raised concerns about deepening political polarisation in South Korea,  embodied perhaps most publicly in the bitter rivalry between Lee and Yoon, and more privately in the country's increasingly extreme online discourse. In December 2023, just weeks before Lee was attacked, a survey sponsored by the newspaper Hankyoreh found that more than 50% of respondents said they felt South Korea's political divide worsening. Some claim that, as Democratic Party leader, Lee played a major role in fuelling the problem, frequently blocking motions by Yoon's government and effectively rendering him a lame-duck president. Such constant stonewalling by the Democratic Party only exacerbated Yoon's leadership struggles - which also included repeated impeachment attempts against administration officials and constant opposition to his budget. Finally, as the pressure against him mounted, the former president took the drastic step of declaring martial law. Yoon's declaration of martial law on 3 December - made in a self-proclaimed bid to eliminate ""anti-state forces"" and North Korea sympathisers - served as the catalyst for Lee to emerge as a leading presidential candidate. Within hours of the declaration, Lee appealed to the public via a livestream broadcast and urged them to assemble in protest outside the National Assembly building in central Seoul. Thousands responded, clashing with police and blocking military units as opposition lawmakers rushed into the assembly building, clambering over fences and walls in a desperate attempt to block Yoon's order. Lee was among them, climbing over the fence to enter the National Assembly and helping to pass the resolution to lift martial law. The Democratic Party later decided to impeach President Yoon - a decision that was unanimously upheld by South Korea's Constitutional Court on 4 April, 2025. It was then that Lee began the path to a full-fledged election bid, announcing his resignation as leader of the Democratic Party on 9 April ahead of his presidential run. In the Democratic Party presidential primary held on April 27, he was selected as the general candidate with overwhelming support. The result of Yoon's abortive martial law attempt was a political maelstrom from which South Korea is still reeling: a constitutional crisis that ended the former president's career and left his PPP in tatters. But of the small few who have managed to leverage that chaos to their advantage, none have benefitted more than Lee. He is now president of South Korea, but his future in the courts is yet to be decided.  They have agreed to postpone his legal hearings until after the election, which means he could be convicted while in office. And that could mean South Korea, having just endured a months-long period of political turmoil, may not be done with upheaval just yet. Copyright 2025 BBC.

6/3/2025,Article,News,Martial law fractured South Korea. Can this election heal the nation?,https://bbc.com/news/articles/c7069pg4zpko,"The striking feature of this election has been the leading opposition candidate, Lee Jae-myung, campaigning in a bullet-proof vest.  At a recent rally, he was escorted to the podium by close protection officers, ready to shield him with their ballistic briefcases. He then addressed the crowd from behind bullet-proof glass, under the gaze of rooftop watchers. This is not South Korean politics as usual. But South Korea has not been itself lately. It is still recovering from the martial law crisis last December, when the president, Yoon Suk Yeol, tried to orchestrate a military takeover.  He failed, because of resistance from the public and politicians, and was impeached, triggering this snap election to choose his successor. But the chaos Yoon unleashed that night has festered.  While stuck in limbo, without a president, the country has become more polarised and its politics more violent.  At street protests earlier this year it became commonplace to chant for various political leaders to be executed. And since launching his presidential bid, Lee has been receiving death threats, and his team say they have even uncovered a credible plot to assassinate him. This election is an opportunity to steer South Korea back onto safer, more stable ground, and heal these fractures. Given this, the ruling party was always going to struggle, marred by President Yoon's self-defeating coup. But rather than break away from the disgraced former president, the conservative People Power Party (PPP) has chosen a candidate who repeatedly defended Yoon and his actions. Kim Moon-soo, Yoon's former labour minister, was the only cabinet member who refused to stand and apologise during a parliamentary hearing into martial law. He said sorry only well into his campaign, after he had won Yoon's public endorsement. This has turned the election into more of a referendum on martial law than anything else. Given most of the public overwhelmingly rejected the move, it has also virtually gilded the path for the opposition leader Lee, who famously livestreamed himself scaling the walls of the parliament complex, to get inside and vote down the president's order. Now the Democratic Party politician portrays himself as the only candidate who can ensure this never happens again. He has said he will change the constitution to make it more difficult for future presidents to declare martial law. ""We must prevent the return of the rebellion forces,"" Lee urged voters at his recent rally from behind fortified glass. Such promises have pulled in people from across the political spectrum. ""I didn't like Lee before, but since martial law I now trust and depend on him,"" said 59-year-old Park Suh-jung, who admitted this was the first time she had attended a political event. One man in his 50s said he was a member of another smaller political party, but had decided to back Lee this time: ""He is the only person who can end Yoon's martial law insurrection. We need to stop those who destroyed our democracy."" Most recent polls put Lee about 10 points ahead of his rival Kim, but he was not always so popular. This is his second time running for president, having lost out to Yoon three years ago. He is a divisive character, who has been embroiled in a series of court cases and political scandals. There are many who do not trust him, who loathe him even. Kim, hoping to capitalise on this, has branded himself ""the fair and just candidate"". It is a slogan his supporters have adopted, many seemingly backing him not for his policies, but because he is not Lee. ""I don't like Kim but at this point there's no real choice. The other candidate has too many issues,"" said one elderly woman who is planning to vote for him. Kim has charted an unusual political path. As a student who campaigned for workers' rights, he was tortured and imprisoned under South Korea's right-wing dictatorship in the 1980s but then moved sharply to the right himself. He was picked by the party base, many of whom are still loyal to Yoon. The party leadership, realising he was not the best choice, tried to replace him at the last minute with a more moderate, experienced politician, only to be blocked by furious members. This has left the party weak and divided, with many suspecting it will splinter into rival factions after voting day. ""Haven't we already imploded?"" one party insider said to me recently, their face crumpled in their hands. ""This is a miserable campaign."" ""Choosing Kim is the biggest mistake the conservative party have made in this election, and they do know that. They will have to be held accountable for this decision,"" said Jeongmin Kim, the executive director of Korea Pro, a Seoul-based news and analysis service. Lee has seized this opportunity to hoover up centrist votes. He has shifted his policies to the right, and even claimed his left-leaning party is, in fact, conservative. This, despite his reputation as a staunch leftist. He grew up in a slum outside Seoul, working in factories rather than attending school, and is someone who has previously quoted US senator Bernie Sanders. But gone are his previous pledges to introduce a universal basic income. This time, he is courting South Korea's powerful conglomerate businesses, the chaebols. He has even incorporated the conservative colour red into his own blue logo, and hits the campaign trail wearing red and blue trainers. He has rebranded his foreign policy too. Typically, his Democratic Party is cautious about Korea's security alliance with the US, preferring to prioritise relations with China and North Korea.  But Lee is casting himself as a ""pragmatist"" who can adapt to a changing security environment. ""The US-Korea alliance is the backbone of our national security. It should be strengthened and deepened,"" he said in a recent televised debate. All this has left voters and diplomats here unsure of what he really stands for, and what he will do if elected - though this seems to be the point. Ms Kim, Korea Pro's analyst, believes his makeover is more genuine than might appear. ""He was already high up in the polls, so he didn't need to work hard to win votes,"" she said. ""I think he is playing a longer game. He wants to be a popular leader, someone who can be trusted by more than half of the country."" Bringing the country together will be the biggest challenge for whoever wins. When people vote on Tuesday, it will be six months to the day since they came out onto the streets to resist a military takeover. After months of chaos, they are desperate to move forward, so the country can start addressing pressing issues that have been on hold, including tariff negotiations with US President Donald Trump.  But more than anything they hope this election can restore their own confidence in their democracy, which has been badly shaken. At a baseball game in the capital Seoul last week – arguably the only place where Koreans are as tribal as they are about politics – both sides were united, acutely aware of this election's importance. ""I'm really concerned about our democracy,"" said Dylan, a data engineer. ""I hope we have the power to save it and make it greater than before. My vote is a piece of power."" ""The next president needs to show people clearly and transparently what he is doing,"" said one man in his mid-20s. ""We need to watch him carefully."" If Lee is to win, and by the margin the polls suggest, he would have a solid mandate, as well as control of parliament, giving him three years to implement major political reforms. That could be good for rebuilding South Korea's stability but would come with its own challenges, said the political analyst Ms Kim. ""If Lee wins, he will have a lot of power. {Given how Yoon behaved} he will need to be very responsible when using it."" Copyright 2025 BBC.

6/3/2025,Article,News,Tesla is 'not interested' in producing cars in India - minister,https://bbc.com/news/articles/ce9vm07k0y7o,"Elon Musk-owned electric vehicle (EV) giant Tesla is ""not interested in manufacturing in India"", the country's heavy industries minister has said. The remarks were made on Monday as the Indian government issued detailed guidelines for a scheme to promote EV manufacturing in the country.  This is the first time that India has publicly admitted that it has not been able to lure investment dollars from Musk, even after unveiling incentives for global EV giants last March.  Minister HD Kumaraswamy confirmed that Tesla would open two showrooms in India and have a retail presence.  ""Mercedes Benz, Skoda-Volkswagen, Hyundai and Kia have shown interest [in manufacturing electric cars in India]. Tesla - we are not expecting from them,"" Kumaraswamy said.  Another official told the Press Trust of India news agency that a Tesla representative had participated in the first round of stakeholder discussions for the manufacturing scheme but  ""was not part of the second and third round"". The comments come on the back of US President Donald Trump saying in February that it would be ""unfair"" for the US if Tesla built a factory in India.  Over the years Tesla has had several rounds of negotiations to enter India. The company's original plans to open a base were shelved in 2022 after the Indian government insisted that Tesla make cars locally. The carmaker had said it wanted to export to India first so that it could test demand. In 2023, Musk said he was ""trying to figure out the right timing"" to invest in the Indian market. Musk met Prime Minister Narendra Modi earlier this year in Washington DC where the two discussed the ""immense potential"" for collaboration in technology and innovation. Last year India cut import taxes on EVs for global carmakers which committed to investing $500m (£369m) and starting local production within three years. This came after Musk complained that high import duties were preventing the carmaker from entering India.  But analysts say the Indian EV market may not be mature enough yet for Tesla to invest locally - EV sales still make up less than 3% of overall passenger vehicle sales in India, and locally made alternatives can cost half of what consumers will have to shell out for Tesla's base model.  Charging infrastructure and local road conditions could be further deterrents.  India's Tata Motors currently leads India's EV market with over 60% market share. MG Motors - jointly owned by India's JSW and a Chinese firm - is second at 22%.  Globally, Tesla has been facing growing competition from Chinese players such as BYD.  Its sales plummeted to their lowest level in three years in the first three months of 2025 after a backlash against Musk and his role in the Trump administration.  Musk announced his departure from his government role last week.  Copyright 2025 BBC.

6/3/2025,Article,News,Mongolia PM resigns after son's luxury holiday stirs public fury,https://bbc.com/news/articles/c5yg8dxv5w9o,"Mongolia's prime minister has resigned after social media photos of his son's lavish lifestyle sparked an anti-corruption investigation and weeks of mass protests. Luvsannamsrain Oyun-Erdene, who has denied wrongdoing, lost a confidence vote in parliament on Tuesday. The viral photos purport to show Oyun-Erdene's son and the son's girlfriend flaunting a black Dior shoulder bag and several shopping bags while on their engagement holiday. Protesters questioned how Oyun-Erdene's family could afford such luxurious living. Local media reported that the country's anti-corruption body had been looking into their finances. The photo of the Dior bag, reportedly posted by the girlfriend, had the caption: ""Happy birthday to me"". Another photo purportedly showed the couple kissing in a swimming pool. The images have been shared on social media and published by local media. During Tuesday's confidence vote, 44 of the 88 lawmakers who took part in the secret ballot voted for Oyun-Erdene, while 38 others voted against him. He needed the support of at least 64 of parliament's 126 members.  ""It was an honour to serve my country and people in times of difficulties, including pandemics, wars, and tariffs,"" he said after the vote. Hundreds of protesters, many of them young people, had been taking to the streets for two weeks before the vote, demanding Oyun-Erdene's resignation. Oyun-Erdene has rejected allegations of corruption, accusing critics of launching a smear campaign against him. According to Transparency International, Mongolia has seen worsening corruption since Oyun-Erdene came into power. Last year, it was ranked 114th out of 180 countries in terms of government transparency. A former communist state sandwiched between Russia and China, Mongolia has been transitioning to democracy since the fall of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s. Corruption is a persistent problem. Last year, US prosecutors sought to forfeit former Mongolian PM Sukhbaatar Batbold's two New York apartments that he allegedly bought using stolen mining funds. Batbold, who served from 2012 to 2015, denied wrongdoing. In recent years, Mongolia has sought to build closer ties with the West, counting the United States and European countries as part of its ""third neighbour"" foreign policy. Copyright 2025 BBC.

6/3/2025,Article,News,India anger over 10-year-old rape victim's death after alleged treatment delay,https://bbc.com/news/articles/cn0gzp0wlrno,"The death of a 10-year-old rape victim in the eastern Indian state of Bihar after an alleged delay in medical treatment has sparked outrage in the country. The girl died on Sunday morning at the state government-run Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH) in the capital Patna.  Her uncle has alleged that the child's condition worsened as she was kept waiting in an ambulance for around four hours on Saturday before being admitted to the hospital. PMCH authorities have denied this, saying that claims of a delay in admission are ""baseless"". The girl's death has made national headlines, with opposition leaders accusing the Bihar government - a coalition led by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Janata Dal United (JD-U) - of gross mismanagement. The government has denied any negligence. The girl is from the Dalit community, which is at the bottom of the Hindu caste hierarchy. Dalits face widespread mistreatment in India despite laws in place to protect them. Following the outrage, the National Human Rights Commission and National Commission for Women have criticised the incident and asked for the hospital's role to be investigated.  Rape victims cannot be named under Indian law. The girl was raped on 26 May, allegedly by a man who lived near her aunt's house in Muzaffarpur. Police have arrested the man and are investigating the crime. The girl went missing while she was playing outside her house. Her family members later found her lying injured near a road. Police officials have told reporters that she had several knife wounds. She was first taken to a local hospital and then to the Sri Krishna Medical College and Hospital (SKMCH), around 85km (53 miles) from Patna. Kumari Vibha, the superintendent of SKMCH, told BBC Hindi that the child had several injuries, including wounds on her chest and neck, but that her condition had stabilised. She was referred to PMCH as she needed reconstruction surgery on her windpipe, Ms Vibha said. But at PMCH, the child's uncle said, they faced a delay in admission while the child waited in the ambulance. ""They [the hospital staff] made us run around for four hours from one hospital department to another one,"" he alleged. She was later admitted to the gynaecology department, he said. The hospital has denied the allegations. IS Thakur, a top hospital official, said that the child's family had initially admitted her to the paediatrics department but that she was sent to the Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) department because of her injuries. ""Since we do not have an ICU in ENT, the child was shifted to the ICU of the gynaecology department,"" he said, adding that the child was brought in an Advance Life Support ambulance, which is equipped to offer critical care. ""The allegations of a delay in getting a hospital bed are baseless,"" Mr Thakur said. The child's plight began making news after a viral video showed members of the opposition Congress party arguing with hospital staff, demanding that she be admitted. Opposition parties in the state have held several protests since the death. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said that the girl's death was ""extremely shameful"" and demanded that strict action be taken against negligent officers. ""The rape victim waited for hours outside PMCH to be admitted... what is the use of the big buildings being built in the name of hospitals when there is chaos, corruption, misbehaviour, lack of resources and insensitivity all around?"" the state's main opposition party Rashtriya Janata Dal said on X. Leaders of the BJP and JD(U) have denied any negligence. Anamika Singh Patel, a BJP spokesperson, called the girl's death ""unfortunate"". ""But I myself run a hospital and I know that getting a bed in a hospital is a process which takes time. People in our government are working responsibly,"" she said. The incident has also brought attention to the condition of Bihar's medical infrastructure, months before the state assembly election is due to be held. Last month, a patient at another government hospital in Patna said that a rat bit his toe while he was asleep. Hospital authorities had launched an investigation into the incident. On Tuesday, in a scathing editorial titled Bihar's Shame, the Times of India newspaper highlighted the sorry state of hospitals in the state. It referenced a recent report that found that only half of all ventilators in government hospitals were functional and that capital Patna had just one government doctor for 11,541 people. That ratio is much worse in rural areas. Follow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook. Copyright 2025 BBC.

6/3/2025,Article,News,Defamation trial begins for MyPillow boss Mike Lindell over election claims,https://bbc.com/news/articles/cgeg8ez54ndo,"A US federal trial has begun for MyPillow chief executive and Donald Trump supporter Mike Lindell, who is accused of defaming a former employee at an electronic voting company in the bitter aftermath of the 2020 election. Mr Lindell is being sued by a former employee of Dominion Voting Systems, who claims Mr Lindell falsely accused him of helping to steal the vote - which was won by Joe Biden. The man says his reputation was ""irreparably tarnished"" by Mr Lindell. Dominion itself has also filed cases against several Trump allies who it claims baselessly alleged that the company's voting machines had been rigged during the vote.  Trump himself asserted that there had been widespread voter fraud – a claim that was labelled ""baseless"" by a select committee report into an attack on the US Capitol on 6 January 2021 by Trump's supporters. Proceedings in Mr Lindell's case began in Denver, Colorado, on Monday with jury selection.  Outside the court, he said: ""We're in a battle of biblical proportions, of evil and good."" He is expected to take the stand to defend himself during the jury trial. Judge Nina Wang, a Biden appointee, will preside. The man who brought the case, Eric Coomer, is a Colorado resident who handled security for Dominion Voting Systems. He filed lawsuits in 2022 against Mr Lindell and two of his companies, My Pillow, Inc and Lindell TV, for an undisclosed amount. A court filing says: ""After more than fifteen years as a respected professional at the top of his field, Dr Coomer's reputation has been irreparably tarnished."" He ""now endures frequent credible death threats and the burden of being made the face of an imagined criminal conspiracy of unprecedented scope in American history"", says the filing. In 2021, several major US shops stopped carrying Mr Lindell's products as he began endorsing election conspiracies. Trump himself has falsely claimed the 2020 election was ""rigged"" by mass voter fraud. Dominion sued Fox News for $1.6bn (£1.2bn) accusing the network of spreading lies about the election. Fox settled out of court for $787.5m. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.  The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites. Read about our approach to external linking.  "
6/3/2025,Article,News,UN aid trucks come under attack in Sudan,https://bbc.com/news/articles/c0j76z5jd1lo,"Five members of a United Nations convoy carrying aid to the war-torn Sudanese city of el-Fasher have been killed in an attack, UN agencies have said. Several people were also injured and multiple trucks burnt in Monday night's assault, which took place near el-Koma in the state of North Darfur, they added. The two sides in Sudan's gruelling civil war - the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) and the regular army - have accused each other of striking the UN convoy with drones. The UN did not say how the attack happened, but called for an urgent investigation and for the perpetrators to be held to account. The convoy was made up of 15 trucks from the UN's food and children's agencies, who said it was ""devastating"" that the aid did not reach ""famine-stricken"" el-Fasher. El-Fasher is the last major location in North Darfur under army control. Civilians and military personnel there have been under attack by the RSF for over a year. The convoy was attempting to reach children and families in the city with life-saving food and nutrition supplies when it was attacked, said the joint statement from the World Food Programme (WFP) and the UN children's agency Unicef.  Following the attack, the el-Koma Emergency Room, a group of local volunteer responders, posted a video of a burnt out truck loaded with sacks of supplies on Facebook. The group blamed the attack on the Sudanese army. El-Koma, which is controlled by the RSF, has previously been the target of frequent attacks in the conflict between the paramilitary group and the army.  Assaults on the city have resulted in civilian deaths and damaged key infrastructure. The el-Koma Emergency Room said at least 89 people were killed or injured after Sudanese army warplanes launched airstrikes in the town on Sunday. The army has not responded to this accusation. According to the Sudan Tribune news website, the planes struck a busy market in el-Koma. The war, which began more than two years ago, has created one of the world's worst humanitarian crises. On Tuesday Eujin Byun, a spokesperson for the UN refugee agency, said more than four million people have fled since the beginning of the conflict. The civil war broke out in 2023 following a vicious struggle for power between the army and the RSF.  The two had jointly staged a coup to derail Sudan's transition to democracy, before their commanders fell out.  Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

6/3/2025,Article,News,Trump tariffs forecast to hurt global growth,https://bbc.com/news/articles/cq69j753egeo,"UK economic growth will suffer because of US tariff barriers and high interest payments on government debt, an influential global policy group has said. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) cut its expectations for UK growth this year to 1.3% from the 1.4% it had predicted in March. The think tank has cut forecasts globally due to trade tensions, but said the UK faced particular issues due to its ""very thin"" buffer in public finances, calling on Chancellor Rachel Reeves to boost tax take and cut spending. In response to the OECD's comments, Reeves said she was ""determined to go further and faster to put more money in people's pockets through our plan for change"". Next week, Reeves will set out her Spending Review where she faces tough choices on allocating departmental budgets. The government has already committed billions of pounds to defence, while the NHS is also expected to be a focus amid Labour's pledge to reduce waiting lists. In March, Reeves was forced to announce £14bn in measures, including £4.8bn in welfare cuts, to restore headroom against her self-imposed fiscal rules. While the OECD highlighted better-than-expected UK economic growth, which strengthened to 0.7% between January and March, it cautioned that ""momentum is weakening"" due to ""deteriorating"" business sentiment. It forecast the UK economy would expand by 1% in 2026, compared to the 1.2% it pencilled in a few months ago. ""The state of the public finances is a significant downside risk to the outlook if the fiscal rules are to be met,"" the OECD said. It suggested that Reeves should adopt a ""balanced approach"" of ""targeted spending cuts"" and tax increases to improve the UK's public finances. ""Strengthening the public finances remains a priority... including through the upcoming Spending Review,"" the OECD said. It suggested closing tax loopholes and re-evaluating council tax bands based on updated property values.  Under the current system, council tax in England is calculated based on the price the property would have sold for in April 1991. For Wales, it is evaluated on property prices in April 2003. Meanwhile, worldwide growth is now expected to slow to a ""modest"" 2.9%, down from a previous forecast of 3.1%, the OECD said. It blamed a ""significant"" rise in trade barriers and warned that ""weakened economic prospects will be felt around the world, with almost no exception"". The OECD's comments come as Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey told a Treasury Select Committee on Wednesday that the global system of trade agreements had been ""blown up to a considerable degree"" by global trade tensions.  Since US President Donald Trump returned to the White House, a long list of countries have been targeted by tariffs, but Trump's unpredictable approach to implementing the measures has created widespread uncertainty.  ""We are forecasting basically a downgrade for almost everybody,"" Alvaro Pereira, the OECD's chief economist told the BBC.  ""We'll have a lot less growth and job creation than we had forecasted in the past."" The group also slashed the outlook for the US economy this year from 2.2% to 1.6% and predicted growth would slow again in 2026. It warned that the US was at risk from rising inflation, something that Trump repeatedly promised would fall during his presidential campaign. Prior to the release of the OECD report on Tuesday, Trump wrote on social media: ""Because of Tariffs, our Economy is BOOMING!"" However, the most recent official data showed the US economy shrank at an annual rate of 0.2% in the first three months of this year, the first contraction since 2022.  Copyright 2025 BBC.

6/3/2025,Article,News,TikTok Shop food listings 'putting people at risk',https://bbc.com/news/articles/c9djwv3q6w9o,"TikTok users are selling food without listing allergen information, the BBC has found. Listings on TikTok Shop show people selling snacks and sweets without highlighting they contain one of the 14 main allergens that UK businesses are legally required to declare. When the BBC brought these listings to TikTok's attention, it deleted them and said: ""TikTok Shop is committed to providing a safe and trustworthy shopping experience."" Simon Williams, chief executive of Anaphylaxis UK, warned allergy suffers: ""If the ingredient and allergen information isn't there, don't buy it. You're putting your life in grave danger."" A TikTok spokesperson said: ""We have policies and processes in place with our sellers to ensure the safety of food and beverages sold on our platform and we will remove products that breach these policies."" However, it is currently possible to sell food on TikTok Shop without providing any ingredient or allergy information. The BBC found one seller, Mega Buy UK, selling a sweet treat related to the popular Netflix show Squid Game and listed the ingredients and allergens as ""not applicable"". Another UK-based seller called The Nashville Burger listed a burger-making kit that contained milk - one of the 14 allergens food businesses in the UK are required to declare on labels. It also contained wheat - which should be listed as an allergen under cereals containing gluten. However, on TikTok Shop, the allergen information was given as ""spices"" and the ingredient description simply said ""flour"". The BBC also found a seller called UK Snack Supply advertising lollipops and crisps with no ingredient or allergen information. TikTok has deleted the adverts the BBC highlighted, but all three companies are still on TikTok Shop selling other products without providing full allergen information. The BBC has approached all of these sellers for comment but could not independently verify that the sellers were all listed in the UK. However, allergy charities say regardless of where the firms are based more should be done to keep consumers safe. TikTok is a place where food trends go viral - from the pickle challenge which involved eating a hot pickle wrapped in a fruit roll-up - to Dubai chocolate which sparked a shopping frenzy. And while users consume the videos TikTok has also become a platform to buy and sell a bite of the action. Kate Lancaster's two children both have milk allergies and she regularly posts advice on TikTok as The Dairy Free Mum. She thinks TikTok has a responsibility to ensure all products sold on its shopping platform meet safety and labelling standards. ""It's completely unacceptable and really worrying. Failing to provide ingredient information is potentially very dangerous, and it feels like a complete disregard for the safety of those living with food allergies,"" she said. Tanya Ednan-Laperouse co-founded The Natasha Allergy Research Foundation in the name of her daughter who died after an allergic reaction to a Pret a Manger sandwich. She said: ""'TikTok should be responsible for ensuring that all their UK food sellers meet legislative requirements to sell food products on their app.  ""Any that don't should be immediately removed from the app and investigated, but ideally this should not happen if their checks and balances are rigorous and in place."" After her daughter's death, new safety rules, known as ""Natasha's Law"",  were introduced which require full ingredient and allergen labelling on all food made on premises and pre-packed for direct sale. Kate believes TikTok is allowing sellers to ""swerve"" basic food labelling requirements as the app allows people not to list any ingredients at all and thinks the platform should penalise those who don't provide the correct information. ""Since Natasha's Law has come into effect I feel that, in general, allergy labelling has improved, but it's frightening that a huge platform like TikTok does not have adequate measures to ensure that labelling is in place,"" she said. ""The thought of someone with a food allergy, or an allergy parent, buying items that they assume are safe, when in fact they may not be, is really scary."" Mr Williams from Anaphylaxis UK says the ultimate responsibility lies with the seller but does think TikTok could do more. ""At the moment it's being used as a platform to sell things that may not be safe. They [TikTok] do need to do more,"" he said, ""There's a lot of people making a lot of money, great side hustle, but they're putting people at risk."" Dr James Cooper, deputy director of food policy at the Food Standards Agency (FSA), which is responsible for food safety in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, said: ""Wherever people buy their food, it needs to be safe and what it says it is. ""Food businesses in the UK must be registered with their local authority and follow food law. All food businesses have a legal responsibility to sell safe food and provide allergen information."" The FSA website says that if food is sold online or over the phone through ""distance selling"" then allergen information must be provided at two different stages in the order process. This usually means providing allergy information in the online description and then also on the packaging so a buyer has two opportunities to check if their allergy could be triggered.

6/3/2025,Article,News,One death every seven minutes: The world's worst country to give birth,https://bbc.com/news/articles/c5yk8ek86kdo,"At the age of 24, Nafisa Salahu was in danger of becoming just another statistic in Nigeria, where a woman dies giving birth every seven minutes, on average. Going into labour during a doctors' strike meant that, despite being in hospital, there was no expert help on hand once a complication emerged. Her baby's head was stuck and she was just told to lie still during labour, which lasted three days. Eventually a Caesarean was recommended and a doctor was located who was prepared to carry it out. ""I thanked God because I was almost dying. I had no strength left, I had nothing left,"" Ms Salahu tells the BBC from Kano state in the north of the country. She survived, but tragically her baby died. Eleven years on, she has gone back to hospital to give birth several times and takes a fatalistic attitude. ""I knew [each time] I was between life and death but I was no longer afraid,"" she says. Ms Salahu's experience is not unusual. Nigeria is the world's most dangerous nation in which to give birth. According to the most recent UN estimates for the country, compiled from 2023 figures, one in 100 women die in labour or in the following days. That puts it at the top of a league table no country wants to head. In 2023, Nigeria accounted for well over a quarter - 29% - of all maternal deaths worldwide.  That is an estimated total of 75,000 women dying in childbirth in a year, which works out at one death every seven minutes. Warning: This article contains an image depicting a newly born child. The frustration for many is that a large number of the deaths – from things like bleeding after childbirth (known as postpartum haemorrhage) – are preventable. Chinenye Nweze was 36 when she bled to death at a hospital in the south-eastern town of Onitsha five years ago. ""The doctors needed blood,"" her brother Henry Edeh remembers. ""The blood they had wasn't enough and they were running around. Losing my sister and my friend is nothing I would wish on an enemy. The pain is unbearable."" Among the other common causes of maternal deaths are obstructed labour, high blood pressure and unsafe abortions. Nigeria's ""very high"" maternal mortality rate is the result of a combination of a number of factors, according to Martin Dohlsten from the Nigeria office of the UN's children's organisation, Unicef. Among them, he says, are poor health infrastructure, a shortage of medics, costly treatments that many cannot afford, cultural practices that can lead to some distrusting medical professionals and insecurity. ""No woman deserves to die while birthing a child,"" says Mabel Onwuemena, national co-ordinator of the Women of Purpose Development Foundation. She explains that some women, especially in rural areas, believe ""that visiting hospitals is a total waste of time"" and choose ""traditional remedies instead of seeking medical help, which can delay life-saving care"". For some, reaching a hospital or clinic is near-impossible because of a lack of transport, but Ms Onwuemena believes that even if they managed to, their problems would not be over. ""Many healthcare facilities lack the basic equipment, supplies and trained personnel, making it difficult to provide a quality service."" Nigeria's federal government currently spends only 5% of its budget on health – well short of the 15% target that the country committed to in a 2001 African Union treaty. In 2021, there were 121,000 midwives for a population of 218 million and less than half of all births were overseen by a skilled health worker. It is estimated that the country needs 700,000 more nurses and midwives to meet the World Health Organization's recommended ratio. There is also a severe lack of doctors. The shortage of staff and facilities puts some off seeking professional help. ""I honestly don't trust hospitals much, there are too many stories of negligence, especially in public hospitals,"" Jamila Ishaq says. ""For example, when I was having my fourth child, there were complications during labour. The local birth attendant advised us to go to the hospital, but when we got there, no healthcare worker was available to help me. I had to go back home, and that's where I eventually gave birth,"" she explains. The 28-year-old from Kano state is now expecting her fifth baby. She adds that she would consider going to a private clinic but the cost is prohibitive. Chinwendu Obiejesi, who is expecting her third child, is able to pay for private health care at a hospital and ""wouldn't consider giving birth anywhere else"". She says that among her friends and family, maternal deaths are now rare, whereas she used to hear about them quite frequently.  She lives in a wealthy suburb of Abuja, where hospitals are easier to reach, roads are better, and emergency services work. More women in the city are also educated and know the importance of going to the hospital. ""I always attend antenatal care… It allows me to speak with doctors regularly, do important tests and scans, and keep track of both my health and the baby's,"" Ms Obiejesi tells the BBC.  ""For instance, during my second pregnancy, they expected I might bleed heavily, so they prepared extra blood in case a transfusion was needed. Thankfully, I didn't need it, and everything went well."" However, a family friend of hers was not so lucky. During her second labour, ""the birth attendant couldn't deliver the baby and tried to force it out. The baby died. By the time she was rushed to the hospital, it was too late. She still had to undergo surgery to deliver the baby's body. It was heart-breaking."" Dr Nana Sandah-Abubakar, director of community health services at the country's National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA), acknowledges that the situation is dire, but says a new plan is being put in place to address some of the issues. Last November, the Nigerian government launched the pilot phase of the Maternal Mortality Reduction Innovation Initiative (Mamii). Eventually this will target 172 local government areas across 33 states, which account for more than half of all childbirth-related deaths in the country. ""We identify each pregnant woman, know where she lives, and support her through pregnancy, childbirth and beyond,"" Dr Sandah-Abubakar says. So far, 400,000 pregnant women in six states have been found in a house-to-house survey, ""with details of whether they are attending ante-natal [classes] or not"". ""The plan is to start to link them to services to ensure that they get the care [they need] and that they deliver safely."" Mamii will aim to work with local transport networks to try and get more women to clinics and also encourage people to sign up to low-cost public health insurance. It is too early to say whether this has had any impact, but the authorities hope that the country can eventually follow the trend of the rest of the world. Globally, maternal deaths have dropped by 40% since 2000, thanks to expanded access to healthcare. The numbers have also improved in Nigeria over the same period - but only by 13%. Despite Mamii, and other programmes, being welcome initiatives, some experts believe more must be done – including greater investment. ""Their success depends on sustained funding, effective implementation and continuous monitoring to ensure that the intended outcomes are achieved,"" says Unicef's Mr Dohlsten. In the meantime, the loss of each mother in Nigeria - 200 every day - will continue to be a tragedy for the families involved. For Mr Edeh, the grief over the loss of his sister is still raw. ""She stepped up to become our anchor and backbone because we lost our parents when we were growing up,"" he says. ""In my lone time, when she crosses my mind. I cry bitterly.""

6/3/2025,Article,News,"Glastonbury stage times revealed for Olivia Rodrigo, Charli XCX and more",https://bbc.com/news/articles/cx2jd8e6918o,"With just three weeks to go, Glastonbury Festival has unveiled its full line-up and stage times for 2025 - complete with gaps for secret sets. The 1975, Neil Young and Olivia Rodrigo will headline the Pyramid Stage, with other highlights including Charli XCX, Doechii, Rod Stewart, Loyle Carner, The Prodigy and Wolf Alice. Irish rap trio Kneecap remain on the line-up, after being removed from Glasgow's TRNSMT festival following a well-publicised row over their political statements. And, as always, there are surprises in store. Several slots are marked ""TBA"", with rumoured guests including festival stalwarts like Haim and Pulp; alongside more far-fetched options such as Lady Gaga and Radiohead. Lady Gaga last played Glastonbury at the start of her career in 2009. Asked what it would take for her to return to the festival earlier this year, she replied: ""Not much"".  Eagle-eyed fans will also spot that an unknown band called ""Patchwork"" are billed on the main stage on Saturday afternoon - calling to mind the 2023 festival, when the mysteriously named ""ChurnUps"" turned out to be the Foo Fighters. The festival will kick off with two opening ceremonies on Wednesday 25 June, including a theatre and circus show - including high wire walkers and acrobats - in the Pyramid field, followed by a fireworks display at 22:45 BST. At the same time, a 1,000-voice choir will unite in what organisers call ""a powerful mantra for peace"", around the Flame of Hope - which unites 15 sacred flames from around the world.

6/3/2025,Article,Travel,How a little town became Japan's unexpected art haven,https://bbc.com/travel/article/20250529-the-japanese-island-that-was-saved-by-art,"Once polluted and suffering from depopulation, Naoshima has become Japan's hottest contemporary art enclave – and there are signs that life there may be finally rebounding. Shinichi Kobayashi has idyllic memories of growing up on Naoshima, one of the nearly 3,000 islands scattered across Japan's Seto Inland Sea. ""We would go clam digging,"" said the 75-year-old, who became the island's mayor in 2018. ""During the summer, I would spend entire days swimming in the sea, catching turban shells and fish, getting deeply tanned."" ""I don't recall seeing any foreign visitors,"" he added. Kobayashi's home island is no longer off the tourist radar – thanks to the power of modern art. Since the 1989 launch of what has become Benesse Art Site Naoshima  – a multi-island art initiative initiated by billionaire Sōichirō Fukutake – more than 500,000 visitors now flock annually to Naoshima, whose fishing villages, rice fields and craggy coastlines have become the canvas for mesmerising art installations and ambitious museums. In 2010, the Setouchi Triennale launched. The contemporary art festival – which is now one of Japan's foremost international art events – attracts roughly one million visitors to the region each Triennale season. The sixth edition kicked off on 18 April this year and will run until 9 November; the longest Setouchi Triennale ever. Forty years ago, few would have imagined such a transformation. In the early 20th Century, Naoshima had cemented its reputation as a copper smelting hub, but by the 1980s, it was heavily polluted; the raw, rocky land around the Mitsubishi Materials industrial plant denuded of vegetation. The population dwindled dramatically as the young left to seek opportunities in larger cities.  Fukutake's father, publishing magnate Tetsuhiko Fukutake, and Naoshima's then-mayor, Chikatsugu Miyake, aspired to revitalise the bleak area by founding a children's campground. Tetsuhiko died before the project was completed, leaving it to his son. Shocked by Naoshima's pollution, the younger Fukutake purchased a large swathe of the island's unblighted south side. His new plan: to transform the region by erecting attractive museums against its serene coastal landscapes. To enact his vision, he tapped Osaka-born architect Tadao Andō, who had become known for designing buildings that blended seamlessly into their surroundings. ""I was surprised by the idea and thought it would be difficult to achieve,"" Andō said in a 2018 interview where he and Fukutake discussed the project's origins. ""It was so inconvenient! Who would come here?"" ""This project began as an act of resistance,"" explained Fukutake in the interview. ""It was my conscious intention to build a kind of heaven on Earth – the very first paradise that harmonises art, nature and the local community.""   In 1989, Andō designed the Naoshima International Camp, fulfilling the elder Fukutake's vision. In 1992 came the Benesse House Museum, a hotel and contemporary art museum housing works by luminaries including Bruce Nauman, Frank Stella and Hiroshi Sugimoto.   Naoshima was named one of BBC Travel's 25 best places to visit in 2025, a list highlighting destinations that are not only welcoming visitors, but using tourism as a force for good. See the full list here. The island's evolution into a globally renowned open-air museum and international contemporary arts hub was all but assured in 1994, when Yayoi Kusama's yellow and black-spotted Pumpkin was added to the landscape's growing collection of public artworks. This iconic work has since become emblematic of Naoshima itself. ""[The] initial goal wasn’t to promote tourism,"" said Soichiro Fukutake's son, Hideaki, who now helms the Fukutake Foundation. ""But rather to revitalise the region through art and help locals feel a renewed sense of pride in their hometown."" But the mission hasn't just been about building anew. Since 1998 and the start of the Art House Project in the nearby fishing village of Honmura, ""using what exists to create what is to be"" has been a guiding principle, leading to many defunct buildings on Naoshima and the neighbouring islands of Teshima and Inujima to be reborn as art. These include two projects by artist Shinrō Ōtake: Haisha, an old dentist's building transformed with collage, reclaimed materials and a partial giant copy of the Statue of Liberty; and Naoshima Bath ""I♥︎湯"", a public bathhouse now plastered in a patchwork of patterned tiles on the exterior to the full-scale model of an elephant striding across the dividing wall between the male and female bathing sections. Some locals were initially sceptical about the general appeal of such artworks. In the 1980s Toshio Hamaguchi worked for Naoshima's town office and guided executives from Fukutake's company around the island when the International Camp was first being planned. ""I did not expect that we would attract many people by such a project, and particularly by art,"" recalls the retiree. ""However, we have so many visitors thanks to art now."" Since his initial commissions on Naoshima, Andō has designed nine other projects on the island, including the Chichu Art Museum, of which a large portion is built directly into the earth; and the Naoshima New Museum of Art, opening 31 May, which will showcase contemporary art from Japan and Asia. The inaugural exhibition – titled From the Origin to the Future – will feature works by the likes of Japan's Takashi Murakami and Makoto Aida, Cai Guo-Qiang from China and the Korean artist Do Ho Suh. Like the Chichu Art Museum, the Naoshima New Museum of Art blends seamlessly with the environment by burying two of its three storeys beneath the ground. ""It's one of the most ambitious and exciting projects we've undertaken,"" said Hideaki Fukutake. Get there: From Kansai International Airport, take the Shinkansen to Okayama. Get the local JR line to Uno and catch the Naoshima ferry at Uno Port. (~ 4 hours). Where to stay: Indulge at Benesse House and the luxury contemporary ryokan Roka, or rough it at beachside camp Tstutsuji-sō. Book well in advance, particularly during festival times. Alternatively, stay in Takamatsu on Shikoku or Uno on Honshū; frequent ferries connect to the island. Where to eat: The Museum Restaurant Issen at Benesse House serves kaiseki made with island seafood. Also try Naka-Oku and Apron Café in Honmura for delicious, healthy meals. Tickets: Book online for timed visits to Naoshima's key art sites. The success of Benesse Art Site Naoshima in attracting visitors to a once-neglected location has been an inspiration for similar projects in other rural parts of Japan. Art Base Momoshima on the island of Momoshima is helmed by renowned conceptual artist Yukinori Yanagi, while on Ōmi-shima, another Inland Sea island, architect Toyō Itō has established the Toyō Itō Museum of Architecture. As mayor, Kobayashi notes the economic benefits: ""Thanks to the increasing number of visitors, guesthouses and restaurants have flourished, helping make everyday life more vibrant for the locals."" He added: ""That said, we've also seen some changes, like more people locking their doors, which wasn't common in the past… For me, what matters most is that the residents can live cheerfully, energetically and happily."" Threatening this is the island's persistent issue of depopulation: Naoshima currently has 3,000 residents, around half the number it had in the 1980s. ""Personally, I strongly wish to increase it,"" said Kobayashi. ""Even if just by one person."" More like this:  • How the bullet train transformed Japan • How Japan's tsunami-ravaged coastline is being transformed by hope • Japan's 97-year-old cherry blossom guardian   However, there are glimmers of hope; a 2024 Asahi Shimbun article cited that though the island's population was in decline in 2022, the number of newcomers has risen slightly but steadily each year since. Over the past five years, 500 people – mainly married urban couples in their 30s and 40s – moved to the island, attracted by its unique artsy beauty. Many Benesse Art Site Naoshima staff have relocated to the island while others have come to fill jobs in the booming hospitality industry – so much so that Naoshima is now facing a housing shortage. Mitsubishi Materials has also significantly cleaned up its copper smelting operations, improving the overall quality of life. Speaking at a conference on Naoshima in 2023, Eriko Ōsaka, a respected curator and general director of The National Art Center, Tokyo, credited Benesse Art Site Naoshima organisers with changing the island's image ""from being a negative one to a positive one through the power of art"". In Ōsaka’s opinion, visitors to Naoshima ""can experience serendipity that they can find nowhere else and discover something unknown within themselves"". For her, the success of Benesse Art Site Naoshima means that some of those islanders who have moved away ""will come back one day"". -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.  For more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.

6/3/2025,Article,Travel,The women saving Japan's vanishing cuisine,https://bbc.com/travel/article/20250530-the-women-saving-japans-vanishing-cuisine,"For 450 years, the little-known Ryukyu Kingdom thrived in what is now Japan. Now, after nearly vanishing, its unique fusion cuisine is being revived. ""You can learn a lot about a person by looking at their tongue,"" Yukie Miyaguni tells me in the kitchen-classroom of her second-storey apartment in Uruma, a city on the Japanese island of Okinawa. I've taken a few cooking classes over the years, but this is the first time anyone's ever asked to examine my tongue. With my mouth agape, Miyaguni – a Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) practitioner and Ryukyuan chef – gives my tongue a long look before drawing its likeness on a whiteboard and offering a prescription: ""More cacao at night, honey in the morning and more butter,"" she concludes, noting it will help improve my blood circulation and dry skin.  I didn't come to Okinawa for a diagnosis per se, but in many ways, it was my taste buds that led me to Miyaguni's kitchen. I had been hoping to learn more about the island's elusive and indigenous Ryukyuan cuisine, which can be traced back to the 12th Century when the Ryukyu Islands began trading with other East Asian states. The Ryukyu Islands stretch more than 1,100km, from the southern tip of Kyushu to north-eastern Taiwan. From 1429-1879, the archipelago flourished as a semi-autonomous state known as the Ryukyu Kingdom and was an important cross-section of maritime trade during its 450-year history. Over time, the islands developed a distinctive cultural and culinary identity that blended endemic ingredients like bitter melon, shikuwasa (a lime-like citrus fruit), beni-imo (purple sweet potatoes) and mozuku seaweed with non-native cooking techniques and ingredients. Siamese (modern-day Thai) traders brought indica rice; the Chinese introduced a variety of herbs, teas and pork; and Korean merchants taught residents how to pickle and ferment seafood and vegetables. BBC.com's World's Table ""smashes the kitchen ceiling"" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future. As Miyaguni explained, when the Kingdom's royal family welcomed visiting envoys and magistrates, they did so with a refined style of cooking and customs called ""court cuisine"" (Ukwanshin Ryori), in which portions of hana-ika (sliced squid), minudaru (steamed pork in seasame sauce), gunbomachi (burdock root wrapped in pork) and more were presented in a Ryukyuan lacquerware called a tundabun. When Japan annexed and renamed the island chain Okinawa in 1879, court cuisine spread from the upper echelons of Ryukyuan society to the countryside. Everyday households continued to pass down home-cooked recipes from the islands' more relaxed ""folk cuisine"" as well. But when US forces occupied Okinawa for several decades after World War Two, a mixture of American fast food influence, a rapid assimilation to Japanese culture, food shortages and economic hardships led to the near disappearance of the islands' ancient fusion food culture. Now, thanks to a growing contingent of women like Miyaguni, a resurgence of Ryukyuan cuisine is quietly underway. ""This was the food of our ancestors,"" Miyaguni says, slicing into a pimply green bitter gourd called goya and tossing it into a small mixing bowl along with tofu, eggs and pork to make a traditional style of stir fry called champaru. Meaning ""to mix together"", champaru dishes are often considered the spirit of Okinawa because they reflect the islands' diverse influences. ""By cooking this way,"" Miyaguni continued, ""we honour their [memories] and keep this ancient culture alive."" As with traditional Japanese cuisine on the mainland, Ryukyuan food is rooted in locally sourced and seasonal ingredients. Dishes and ingredients like goya champaru, jimami (peanut) tofu, slow-boiled agu (pork) and umibudo (sea grapes) served in tundabun or Okinawan pottery called yachimun are integral to keeping the traditions of Ryukyuan court cuisine and folk cuisine alive. ""Ryukyuan cuisine is not colourful, so using these plates and lacquerware helped make the food look more vivid,"" Miyaguni explained, pointing to the fire engine-red tundabuncontaining each dish on the table. After we finished kneading the dough for chinsuko (a traditional Okinawan shortbread made of lard, flour and sugar) and placed it in the oven, we sat down to enjoy the fruits of our labour. As I savoured delicate bites of buttery soft peanut tofu, slices of black sesame-coated pork loin and mung bean rice balls wrapped in banana leaves, Miyaguni explained the health benefits of Ryukyuan food. She said ingredients like bitter melon and purple sweet potatoes are high in antioxidants and help lower blood sugar and aid digestion, while awamori, a locally distilled spirit, can aid in gut health. Miyaguni's interest in preserving Ryukyuan food culture is rooted in the Chinese philosophy of food as medicine. After retiring as a nutritionist at a hospital in Okinawa in 2008, Miyaguni encountered TCM and began to learn about its ""deep connection"" to Ryukyuan cuisine. For the last 10 years, Miyaguni has been teaching locals and visitors about the health components of Ryukyuan cuisine from her home. In 2018, she was selected as a representative of Ryukyuan cuisine by the Okinawa Prefectural Governor. ""Until now, Okinawa has been the pride of the world as the island of longevity. However, now the health of the people is deteriorating,"" Miyaguni said. Miyaguni explained that even after the islands were annexed, Ryukyuan folk cuisine was still governed by the Chinese philosophy of ishoku dogen, which emphasises the importance of using high-quality, seasonally available ingredients. Homemade tofu, mugwort soup, purple potato and bitter melon remained staples of folk cuisine, along with the Confucian belief of using all parts of the pig. ""Everything but the oink,"" Miyaguni said. Today, Miyaguni still keeps a book in her kitchen called Gozen Honzō (Edible Plants of Ryukyu), which was written by a chief physician to the king of the Ryukyuan Kingdom. ""Gozen Honzō… explains the types of and used of edible plants, animals and many other foods and a number of sections describe methods of preparing them,"" Miyaguni said. ""We've lost the Ryukyuan language because it isn't taught, but understanding how our ancestors cooked, and teaching these traditions is how we will continue to protect the Ryukyuan culture for future generations,"" she added. While Miyaguni's interest in preserving Ryukyuan cuisine stems from her medicinal background, Kazumi Kayo, a Ryukyuan cooking instructor and food culture ambassador for the Okinawa Prefecture, says her interest in reviving these culinary traditions goes back to her mother. ""When I was young, I was not interested in Ryukyuan cuisine,"" Kayo said. ""However, the memory of the taste that my mother made for me since I was a child came back to me, and I wanted to maintain a cooking method that brought out the taste of these simple ingredients, so I specialised in cooking, obtained a qualification and started a cooking class.""  But Kayo is aware that the region's famous longevity – which many believe is inextricably linked to its diet – is increasingly in peril.  ""For a long time, Okinawa prefecture has maintained the world's longest life expectancy, but with the Westernisation of food, that ranking has dropped, and now the number of people suffering from lifestyle-related diseases is increasing, which is a problem for the prefecture,"" Kayo said.  In 2016, Okinawa's prefectural government developed a programme called Ryukyuan Cuisine Masters to help preserve Ryukyuan food while also addressing rising health concerns. ""About five years ago, we strengthened training for chefs in the food and beverage industry and nutrition associations, provided them with qualifications and started activities to pass on and popularise Ryukyuan cuisine, including traditional cooking methods,"" Kayo added. ""I think the residents of the prefecture will realise the goodness of Ryukyuan cuisine again.""  Now in her 18th year as a Ryukyuan cooking instructor, Kayo runs the Yonner Food Cooking Studio, whose classes start by taking locals and visitors to Makishi Public Market in downtown Naha. ""Yonnerfood' means 'slow food' in Okinawan dialect, and by having a leisurely chat while shopping and taking a cooking class, I hope to help people learn about Okinawa's food culture and develop a love for Okinawa,"" Kayo said.  More like this: • Japan's spectacular bike ride through six remote islands • The eight Asian sauces to keep in your pantry • Japan's 97-year-old cherry blossom guardian In 2019, in an effort to further prevent the decline of Ryukyuan cuisine, the non-profit Ryukyu Cuisine Preservation Association was established to safeguard and promote the culinary heritage of the Ryukyu Kingdom. The same year, ""The Unbroken Legacy of the Ryukyu Kingdom"" and its unique food culture was registered as a national heritage of Japan. In addition to educational cooking classes like Miyaguni's and Kayo's, a handful of Ryukyuan restaurants and food tours have also cropped up across the islands.  Local tour guide Junko Yokoo's Blue Zone Okinawa Home Cooking Tour takes guests to the home of Hiromi Nerome, another certified Ryukyuan cuisine specialist and chef whose own cooking class is based out of her home in the seaside village of Nakijin. ""I started offering this tour in 2022 in response to tourists' interest in Okinawa's 'longevity' cuisine,"" Yokoo tells me. ""Locally grown vegetables like bitter melon and purple sweet potato are quite different from mainland Japan, so people are curious to taste them and learn about what makes Okinawan food so healthy."" In 2024, Suitenrou opened in downtown Naha and offers a mix of Ryukyuan folk and court cuisine along with traditional music and dancing. For a more formal court cuisine-inspired affair, Kuninda also in downtown Naha serves classic dishes like stewed pork cubes in white miso and sea grapes topped with freshly grated wasabi. But if you ask Miyaguni or Kayo, they will tell you that the key to preserving Ryukyuan food culture starts in the kitchen and is best learned through hands-on experience. ""I think that if we can spread the word and attract attention outside the prefecture and abroad, the people of the prefecture will once again realise the goodness of Ryukyuan cuisine,"" Kayo said. ""If Ryukyuan cuisine disappears, we will lose the identity of Okinawa, so we must preserve it.""  -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.  For more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.

6/3/2025,Article,Travel,Africa's ice cream cafe that nurtures self-esteem,https://bbc.com/travel/article/20250521-africas-ice-cream-cafe-that-nurtures-self-esteem,"Tapi Tapi makes ice cream with a deep mission: to soothe the collective souls of African people by sharing folk traditions, rituals and cultures through food. Located in Cape Town's artistic centre of Observatory, Lower Main Road offers a fascinating array of thrift stores, cafes and restaurants best explored on foot. Among them is an unassuming ice cream cafe called Tapi Tapi (a Bantu ideophone [nyaudzosingwi] that means ""sweet sweet"") whose calligraphy-clad, alley-style entrance serves as an invitation to simply pay attention.  That's because Tapi Tapi is no ordinary ice cream cafe. With a firm focus on rehabilitating the collective self-esteem of African people by sharing folk traditions, rituals and cultures through food practices, all its ice creams are handmade in small batches with ingredients typically communally sourced from the gardens of friends and patrons.  Over the course of each month, you may find a curated menu of ice cream flavours that includes amagwinya (a deep-fried dough from South Africa), kelewele (an ensemble of caramelised plantain, ginger and fire-roasted peanut from Ghana), and nhopi (a roasted pumpkin and dark chocolate pairing common in Zimbabwe). In the next month, the menu might feature flavours like thiakry (a millet couscous and sour milk pairing from West Africa), mbwire mbwire (roasted sorghum biscuits from Zimbabwe), and mowa, an amaranth greens and yellow plum vegan dish that is enjoyed across the continent. No flavours are ever repeated.  Founder Tapiwa Guzha says that Tapi Tapi started as a ""self-imposed dare"" that was largely inspired by childhood memories of lingering in his grandmother's kitchen whenever desserts were being prepared. Born and raised in Zimbabwe, Guzha moved to South Africa in 2005 to study at the University of Cape Town and went on to earn his PhD in molecular biology in 2014. The following year, he began his postdoctoral fellowship in Stellenbosch, a wine oasis in South Africa's Western Cape province, where he recalls seeing a trilingual sign for the first time. ""The default is Afrikaans and English for building signs, room names and that kind of thing,"" he says, ""but the first time I saw a third language was Xhosa [a Bantu language], and it was a 'trespassers will be prosecuted' sign.""    This sparked an internal dialogue in which Guzha began to process the realities of being a black person in South Africa, where despite more than 80% of the population being black, the minority white population still holds the majority of all economic power. This led to increasingly nuanced explorations of different worldviews, which prize Western knowledge systems and food cultures over those of Indigenous people, and simultaneously, interrogations into the parallels between African cosmology and Western science. ""I remember thinking about the difference between a rainmaker [a spiritual intermediary in various African traditions who requests rain through ritual] and a meteorologist. I don't necessarily believe in the ability to conjure up rain from nowhere, but I do believe in the ability to understand weather patterns and using that knowledge to drive a narrative in whatever context – but one system is not as valued as the other one,"" he says.   BBC.com's World's Table ""smashes the kitchen ceiling"" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future. Guzha remembers traveling from Cape Town to Stellenbosch and witnessing the lush vineyard and cascading mountain landscapes of the Cape Winelands, and the contrasting, painful realities of the wine labourers working on the farms. Simultaneously, he was finding himself feeling increasingly disillusioned by the academy and sensibilities of modern science. He found that the cities he was visiting for his postdoctoral research were repeatedly pointing him away from science and more toward the abundance of Indigenous agriculture and knowledge systems. Following his grandmother's funeral in 2018, Guzha returned to Cape Town, having decided to leave academia and instead do something in food. He had been making ice cream at home for eight years, and charged himself with a mission to turn his skills into a potential business. At first, he experimented with fermented and alcohol-infused ice cream, but then he came across snacks from his home country of  Zimbabwe at a local restaurant and decided to try adding them to ice cream. The snacks included maputi (popped maize), Mazoe orange crush (an orange cordial, sometimes also used in cocktails and fruit punches), baobab (a large pulpy fruit with a citrus-like flavour), small and tangy masau fruit, and nyii, a sweet berry that can be eaten fresh, dried or candied. ""It was the first time I ate ice cream that really connected with who I am. It was nostalgic and made me think of happy times. I connected with it beyond its delicious flavour.""  Guzha officially opened Tapi Tapi as a direct-delivery service in 2018 and has since gone on to ground his continental storytelling through ice cream into a brick-and-mortar cafe. The walls are adorned with Kasvikiro art, a self-taught Afro calligraphy inspired by his keen interest in alphabet systems and handwriting. A reminder also hangs on the entrance wall: ""This is your home, the land of your people. Nourish yourself from it and tend to it so that others may enjoy it too. Remember, our lives, stories and histories don't begin in 1488 [when the first European rounded the southern tip of Africa]. You come from a time and place most ancient. We have been here from the very beginning.""  Since then, Guzha has gone on to collaborate with poets, conservationists, yogis and professors across a range of disciplines to host a range of educational experiences, including tasting menus and foraging hikes. Zandile Finxa, South African chef, consumer scientist, recipe developer and founder of The Sorghum Agenda digital campaign, explained how a visit to Tapi Tapi prompted a series of conversations about their different approaches to food. More like this: • A West African ode to a spicy and tangy chicken dish • The ancient lore of the humble Nigerian yam • Jollof Wars: Who does West Africa's iconic rice dish best? ""I started talking to Guzha about cultural sociology, Indigenous foods and sustainability, and for me, he encompassed all of that,"" they say. For Finxa, engaging with Guzha allowed them to explore the academic side of Indigenous foods and customs drawing on Guzha's scientific background, while also learning from Guzha's cultural exchanges during his travels. Guzha and Finxa's conversations culminated in a collaboration in which Finxa developed a sorghum brownie that Guzha paired with his sorghum blondies ice cream.  Many of the ingredients and ice cream flavours found at Tapi Tapi may not be readily recognisable to people outside Africa. However, this is the idea behind every scoop: to celebrate flavours that are, as Guzha says, ""familiar, nostalgic, local and seasonal, homegrown, common and representative"" of African people without any impositions based on legacies from elsewhere. ""We are not the 'black version of [insert European inspired name here]',"" says Guzha. ""There's a lot of that going around. We don't use 'African sage' in our gelato, we use imphepho. So when you see a name you don't recognise in our flavours, Google it and get to know it for what it is and not for what it approximately represents in your food vocabulary."" For those who cannot get to Tapi Tapi for the ice cream, Guzha offers a range of recipes using ingredients that can be found in the pantries of many African homes, including cookies coated in maize, millet or teff, celebrating grains that would not ordinarily be used to make sweet treats. He serves the cookies with the ice cream.  For Guzha, with a little curiosity and willingness to play and experiment, we can take what have long been simple staples and turn them into delicious desserts. ""There's a lot of magic around us all the time, pay attention and often the land provides. Don't wait on agriculture to feed you when there's bounty abound,"" he says. -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.  For more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.  Copyright 2025 BBC.

6/3/2025,Article,Future,Why China is betting big on salt batteries,https://bbc.com/future/article/20250530-how-electric-scooters-are-driving-chinas-salt-battery-push,"The country is racing ahead of the rest of the world in bringing sodium-ion batteries to the mass market. This time, through scooters. Dozens of glitzy electric mopeds are lined up outside a shopping mall in the city of Hangzhou in eastern China, drawing passersby to test them. But these Vespa-like scooters, which sell for between £300 and £500 ($400 and $660), are not powered by the mainstream lead-acid or lithium-ion cells, commonly used in electric two-wheelers. Instead, their batteries are made from sodium, an abundant element that can be extracted from sea salt. Next to the scooters stand a few fast-charging pillars, which can replenish the vehicles' power level from 0% to 80% in 15 minutes, according to Yadea, the major Chinese two-wheeler manufacturer holding this promotional event in January 2025 for its newly launched mopeds and charging system. There is also a battery-swapping station, which enables commuters to drop in their spent cells in exchange for fresh ones with a scan of a QR code. (Read more about China's battery swap stations for electric vehicles here.) Yadea is one of many companies in China trying to build a competitive edge in alternative battery technologies, a trend that shows just how fast the country's clean-technology industry is developing. Even as the rest of the world tries to close its gap with China in the race to make cheap, safe and efficient lithium-ion batteries, Chinese companies have already taken a head-start towards mass producing sodium-ion batteries, an alternative that could help the industry reduce its dependence on key raw minerals. Chinese carmakers were the first in the world to launch sodium-powered cars. But the impact of these models – all of them tiny with short ranges – has been low so far. In April 2025, the world's largest battery manufacturer, China's CATL, announced its plan to mass-produce sodium-ion batteries for heavy-duty trucks and cars this year under a new brand Naxtra. China's grid operators have also started to build energy storage stations using sodium-ion batteries to help the grid absorb renewables. This is an area considered by many researchers spoken to by the BBC as the main playground for the emerging technology. Chinese companies' multi-pronged strategy in driving sodium-ion batteries will put it in a leading position of a global race – should there be one, says Cory Combs, who researches critical minerals and supply chains at Beijing-based consultancy Trivium China. He says it remains to be seen whether sodium-ion batteries will really take off. But one segment that is betting big on sodium-ion batteries is the two-wheeler, a fast-growing and highly competitive market in China. Yadea has brought three sodium-powered models to the market so far and is planning to launch more. It has also established the Hangzhou Huayu New Energy Research Institute to research emerging battery chemistries, particularly sodium-ion. ""We want to bring technology from the lab to customers fast,"" Zhou Chao, the company's senior vice president, said in January during a talk show on China Central Television in January. Two-wheelers are an extremely popular mode of transport in many Asian countries, including Vietnam and Indonesia. In China, they are ubiquitous, carrying their owners to shops, offices, metro stations and everywhere in between. Because they are practical and versatile, the Chinese have given them an endearing nickname: ""little electric donkeys"". ""Two-wheeled vehicles typically operate over shorter distances and at lower speeds [than cars], making them less demanding in terms of energy density and power output,"" says Chen Xi, who researches energy storage materials and devices at Xi'an-Jiaotong Liverpool University in China. A sodium-ion battery carries significantly less energy than a lithium-ion battery of the same size, which means it has a lower energy density. For two-wheelers, sodium-ion batteries' main rivals are lead-acid ones, whose energy density and rechargeable cycles are even lower. Their only advantage is that they are cheaper than both sodium and lithium-ion batteries currently, Xi says. The sheer number of two-wheelers in Asia paves a promising pathway to achieving economies of scale. In China alone, around 55 million electric two-wheelers were sold in 2023 – nearly six times the number of all pure, hybrid and fuel-cell electric cars combined sold in the country that year – according to Shanghai-based consultancy iResearch. Scale production was the goal of Yadea. Zhou said at the talk show that the firm was seeking to bring sodium batteries to tens of millions of ordinary commuters by not only fitting them into two-wheelers, but also building a charging ecosystem to enable people to use these models without stress. To test the waters, in 2024 Yadea began a pilot programme with 150,000 food delivery couriers working in Shenzhen, a mega city of 17.8 million people in southern China, reported Shenzhen News. The goal was to enable them to hand in a spent Yadea sodium-ion batteries at its partners' battery-swapping stations in exchange for a fully charged one within 30 seconds, Yadea said. Yadea and other companies, such as battery-swapping firm Dudu Huandian, have grown so rapidly in Shenzhen the city now aims to become a ""battery-swapping city"". It aims to install 20,000 charging or swapping pods for various types of batteries for electric scooters in 2025, and 50,000 by 2027, according to Shenzhen Electric Bicycle Industry Association, a trade body that is working with the Shenzhen government to promote battery swapping. The city – which already has a ""battery-swapping park"" – will build a vast network of battery swapping facilities to enable residents to find a station every five minutes, the trade body says. Sodium-ion and lithium-ion batteries have similar structures. The main difference is the ions they use – the particles shuttling back and forth between a battery's positive and negative sides to store and release energy. Sodium is widely dispersed in the sea and the Earth's crust, making it about 400 times more abundant than lithium. Sodium-ion cells are therefore more accessible and potentially cheaper to produce at scale. They could also free the battery industry from choking points in current supply chains. Lithium ore is currently predominantly mined in Australia, China and Chile, but the processing of the mineral is concentrated in China, which has nearly 60% of the world's lithium-refining capacity. Sodium-ion batteries are not a recent invention. Their fate has been intertwined with that of lithium-ion batteries. The research and development of both cells began about half a century ago, with Japan leading the global effort. But after Japanese electronics company Sony launched the world's first lithium-ion battery in 1991, its huge commercial success led the development of sodium-ion technology to be largely paused – until the beginning of this decade. By then, China had become the dominant battery force worldwide through years of an industrial push by the government. More like this: • Where EV batteries go to die – and be reborn • The batteries made from cement • Renewable energy's trouble with 'wind theft' 2021 proved to be a turning point for sodium-ion batteries. The global prices for battery-grade lithium skyrocketed, multiplying over fourfold in a year due to strong demand for electric vehicles (EV) and the Covid-19 pandemic. Battery and EV manufacturers began to look for alternatives. CATL launched its first-ever sodium-ion battery in July that year, and the move ""triggered high industry interest"", says Phate Zhang, founder of the Shanghai-based EV news outlet CnEVPost. Lithium's prices continued to soar in 2022, driving more cost-conscious Chinese companies towards sodium, he notes. ""The relative abundance of sodium and China's interest in a resilient battery supply chain has been a central factor in driving research and development efforts,"" says Kate Logan, a director at the Asia Society Policy Institute in Washington DC who focuses on China's climate and clean energy policies. Around the time of the mineral's price hike, the country imported roughly 80% of the lithium ore it refined, mainly from Australia and Brazil. But the price of lithium started to plunge in late 2022 and is at a fraction of its peak level today. One reason is that major Chinese battery makers such as CATL and Gotion have expanded their lithium-processing capacity, Zhang says. China has also boosted efforts to find and develop domestic lithium reserves. As a result, the ""frenzy"" around sodium-ion in the last couple of years has ""relaxed"", Combs notes. ""Lithium is pretty squarely back in the leadership role again within China."" For many, though, there are other good reasons to take up sodium-ion batteries. One is safety. In 2024, China was shocked by a wave of battery fires, mostly triggered by the self-combustion of lithium-ion batteries in two-wheelers. Globally, fire risks at energy storage stations have become a concern. In a recent example, a blaze broke out at one such facility inside a major battery plant in California in January 2025. Some industry insiders believe that sodium-ion batteries are safer. They are less prone to overheating and burning compared to lithium-ion ones because sodium's chemical traits are more stable, according to some studies. But others warn that it is still too early to be certain about their safety due to a lack of relevant research. Cold weather also makes a difference. The energy a lithium-ion battery can store and the times it can be recharged drop at sub-zero temperatures. Sodium-ion batteries are less affected by harsh conditions. ""Compared to lithium ions, sodium ions move more easily through the liquid inside the battery. This gives them better conductivity and means they need less energy to break free from the surrounding liquid,"" says Tang Wei, a professor of chemical engineering at China's Xi'an Jiaotong University. Tang and his team have developed a new type of battery liquid they say can enable sodium-ion batteries to achieve more than 80% of their room-temperature capacity at −40C (-40F). They are working with Chinese battery firms to apply the technology onto vehicles and energy storage stations in the country's cold regions. Sodium-ion batteries are also expected to reduce the environmental impact of manufacturing the metals used in lithium-ion cells, particularly cobalt and nickel – heavy metals that can negatively impact humans and nature. A 2024 study concluded that sodium-ion batteries can help the world avoid excessive mining and possible depletion of critical raw materials, but that the production process generates similar volumes of greenhouse gas emissions to lithium-ion cells. As these batteries are still being developed, ""their production processes, lifespans and energy density can all be improved"", says Zhang Shan, the study's lead author and a researcher at Chalmers University of Technology in Gothenburg. ""Their impact on the climate may be lower than that of lithium-ion batteries in the future."" Two of the earliest electric cars powered by sodium batteries rolled off the assembly lines in December 2023. So far, all available models have been ""microcars"", officially classified as A00 in China. But their sales only made up a tiny number of the tens of millions of EVs sold in 2024 in China, says Xing Lei, an independent analyst of the Chinese auto industry (one report found just 204 were sold in 2024). A big downside of sodium-ion batteries is their low energy density: a 2020 study found it is at least 30% lower than their lithium counterparts. This means cars using them typically cannot travel very far on a single charge, Zhang says. ""And range is a big deciding factor for people when they buy an EV."" Sodium-ion batteries have yet to achieve mass production and currently ""cannot compete with lithium-ion batteries on price or performance"" in four-wheelers, making large-scale use in the next two or three years difficult, says Chen Shan, a Shanghai-based analyst on battery markets at Norwegian consultancy Rystad Energy. The uptake of sodium scooters across China has been gradual but encouraging. A spokesperson from Yadea – which sold more than 13 million electric bikes and mopeds globally in 2024 – told the BBC that the sales of its sodium two-wheelers reached nearly 1,000 in the first three months of 2025. The company intends to build around 1,000 fast-charging pillars specifically designed for sodium-ion batteries this year in Hangzhou enabling commuters to find a station every 2km (1.2 miles), Zhou said at the talk show. Yadea is not alone in its sodium push. Another Chinese scooter manufacturer, Tailg, has been selling sodium-powered models since 2023. FinDreams, the battery arm of EV major BYD, is building a plant in east China's Xuzhou to make sodium batteries in partnership with Huaihai Group, a manufacturer of two and three-wheelers, according to local media. Although lead-acid batteries will continue to dominate this industry, the market share of sodium-ion batteries has been projected to grow rapidly over the next five years. By 2030, 15% of China's electric scooters will be powered by them, compared to 0.04% in 2023, according to an analysis by the Shenzhen-based Starting Point Research Institute, which assesses China's battery industry. In fact, a bigger market for sodium-ion batteries may be energy storage stations, which absorb power produced at one time so it can be used later. When they are installed in fixed locations, the disadvantages of using sodium-ion batteries in vehicles disappear. ""You can just make a slightly bigger energy storage plant. It's not moving anywhere. The weight [of the batteries] doesn't matter,"" Combs says. Energy storage is expected to be an enormous and a rapidly growing market as countries across the globe aim to reach their climate goals. The world's grid-scale energy storage capacity will need to grow nearly 35-fold between 2022 and 2030 if it is to achieve net-zero by 2050, according to International Energy Agency (IEA). ""This is going to be a really important market in the future, especially as renewables become more present on the grid. You'll have more need for storage systems to balance out the variability in electricity generation, "" says Ilaria Mazzocco, a senior fellow with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington DC-based non-profit. Using sodium-ion batteries in energy storage stations also means that these facilities are not competing with auto companies for batteries, she notes.  China, which has seen breakneck growth of wind and solar power plants, leads the world in using energy storage to support renewables. In May 2024, it switched on its first energy storage station powered by sodium-ion batteries. Situated in southern China's Guangxi, the plant can hold 10 megawatt-hours of power in one go, equivalent to the daily electricity needs of 1,500 households, according to Chinese state media. It is the first phase of a sodium-ion energy storage station 10 times its size. The Guangxi project was quickly followed by another sodium-ion energy storage site in central China's Hubei province. In fact, roughly one-fifth of the capacity of all energy storage projects planned by China's state-run companies last year used sodium technology, according to Chinese outlet Beijixing, which tracks the power industry. But for sodium-ion batteries to succeed in mass production the main question is whether companies can make them cheaper than lithium-ion cells, according to Zheng Jiayue, a consultant with research and consulting firm Wood Mackenzie who specialises in the energy storage supply chain. Currently, the unit price of sodium-ion batteries for energy storage is about 60% higher than that of lithium-ion ones, but the gap is projected to narrow, China Central Television reported, citing analysis by the China Energy Storage Alliance, a Beijing-based non-profit. Some entrepreneurs and researchers believe that sodium is a shortcut for other countries to reduce their battery dependence on China. But it is Chinese companies that are poised to lead global production if the technology breaks into the mass market. Major Chinese battery makers have included it in their strategies to stay competitive in the long run, says Combs, meaning sodium-ion batteries are no longer a way to bypass their stronghold. The ""biggest difference"" between companies in China and other countries is that the former can bring a technology from the lab to mass production much faster, Zheng says. And because of the similarities between the two types of cells, says Logan, existing manufacturing infrastructure for lithium-ion batteries can be adapted to produce sodium-ion batteries, reducing the time and cost for commercialisation in China. ""The same synergies don't necessarily hold true for other battery chemistries,"" however, she adds.   One example is the all-solid-state batteries, which do not use liquid electrolyte to transport ions, the principle driving the current generation of batteries, says Mo Ke, founder and chief analyst of Beijing-based battery-research firm, RealLi Research. Therefore, it will have less reliance on the current industrial chain, Mo says. A fleet of large factories devoted to making sodium-ion cells are now being built in China, some already in operation. In 2024, Chinese manufacturers announced plans to build 27 sodium-ion battery plants with a combined capacity of 180 GWh, according to Chinese thinktank Gaogong Industrial Research, including BYD's upcoming 30GWh plant in Xuzhou. The planned global sodium-ion battery capacity will exceed 500 GWh by 2033, and China is projected to account for more than 90% of that, Zheng says, citing Wood Mackenzie analysis. Outside China, Natron Energy in the US and Faradion in the UK are forerunners. But it typically takes foreign companies much longer to build production lines and it will be hard for their capacities to compete with China's, Zheng says. In 2023 alone, Chinese firms collectively spent more than 55 billion yuan (£5.7bn, $7.6bn) on the research and development of sodium-ion batteries, according to Alicia García Herrero, an economist and senior fellow at Brussels-based think tank Bruegel. This beats the $4.5bn (£3.4bn, $4.5bn) raised by all US battery start-ups cumulatively by 2023 on non-lithium battery solutions, she says. Chinese companies' incentive is simple, according to Combs: ""Don't lose market share, and future markets are included."" Yadea is already expanding operations in Southeast Asia, Latin America and Africa, where electric scooters are also popular, Zhou said in the talk show. Yadea's goal is clear: to mass-produce sodium-ion batteries and improve scooter charging infrastructure, according to Zhou, ""so as to enable hundreds of millions of people to enjoy green transport"". -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.

6/4/2025,Article,News,South Korea's new president has a Trump-shaped crisis to avert,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpvkxxerln1o,"South Korea's new president, Lee Jae-myung, has secured a storming victory, but his honeymoon will barely last the day. The former opposition leader is not getting to enjoy the two-month transition period usually afforded to new leaders, so they can build their team and nail down their vision for the country.  Instead he is entering office immediately, to fill the hole left by the impeachment of the former president, Yoon Suk Yeol, who last December tried and failed to bring the country under martial law. In electing Lee, with almost 50% of the vote , South Koreans have vehemently rejected the military dictatorship that was almost forced upon them. Lee campaigned on the promise that he would strengthen South Korea's democracy and unite the country, after a divisive and tumultuous six months. But that will have to wait. First, he has a Donald Trump shaped crisis to avert. In the coming months, Trump has the power to destabilise South Korea's economy, its security, and its volatile relationship with North Korea. South Koreans were dismayed when Trump slapped 25% tariffs on all Korean imports in April, after already hitting the country with aggressive tariffs on its core industries – steel and cars. They had assumed that being longstanding military allies from the days of the Korean War, and having a free-trade agreement with the US, would spare them. If these tariffs take effect ""they could trigger an economic crisis"", a seasoned advisor to Lee's Democratic Party, Moon Chung-in, said.  Before Trump's announcements, South Korea's economy was already slowing down. The martial law chaos constricted it further. Then, in the first quarter of this year, it contracted. Fixing this has been voters' number one demand, even above fixing their beleaguered democracy. But without a president, talks with Trump have been on hold. They cannot be put off any longer. And there is much more than South Korea's economy at stake in these negotiations. The US currently guarantees South Korea's security by promising to come to its defence with both conventional and nuclear weapons were it to be attacked by its nuclear-armed neighbour, North Korea. As part of this deal there are 28,500 US troops stationed in the South. Yet Trump has made clear he does not plan to differentiate between trade and security when negotiating with the country, signalling that Seoul is not pulling its weight in either area. In a post on his Truth Social platform in April, Trump said that during initial tariff talks with South Korea he had ""discussed payment for the big time military protection we provide"", calling it ""beautiful and efficient one-stop shopping"". This approach makes Seoul uniquely vulnerable.  Evans Revere, a former senior US diplomat based in Seoul, fears a crisis is coming. ""For the first time in our lifetime we have a US president who does not feel a moral and strategic obligation towards Korea"". In his first term as president, Trump questioned the value of having US forces stationed in Korea and threatened to withdraw them unless Seoul paid more to have them. It seems likely he will demand more money this time around. Seoul may not want to pay more, but it can afford to. A bigger problem is that Trump's calculations, and that of his defence department, seem to have changed. This is no longer just about the money. Washington's top priority now in Asia is not just stopping North Korea attacking the South, it is also to contain China's military ambitions in the region and against Taiwan. Last year, a now-senior US defence official, Elbridge Colby, said that South Korea was going to have to take ""overwhelming responsibility for its own self-defence against North Korea"", so the US could be ready to fight China. One option is that the troops stationed here would switch their focus to constraining China. Another, touted by a couple of US defence officials last month, is that thousands of soldiers would be removed from the peninsula altogether and redeployed, and that Seoul's military would also have to play a role in deterring Beijing. Not only could this put South Korea in a dangerous military predicament, but it would also create a diplomatically difficult one. President Lee, who historically has been sceptical of Korea's alliance with the US, wants to use his presidency to improve relations with China, South Korea's powerful neighbour and trading partner. He has stated several times that South Korea should stay out of a conflict between China and Taiwan. ""We must keep our distance from a China-Taiwan contingency. We can get along with both"", he said during a televised debate last month. The political advisor Mr Moon, who once served as national security advisor, reiterated Lee's concerns. ""We are worried about America abandoning us, but at the same time we are worried about being entrapped in American strategy to contain and encircle China"", he said. ""If the US threatens us, we can let [the forces] go"", he said. For Mr Revere, the former US diplomat, this combination of Lee, Trump and China threatens to create ""the perfect storm"". ""The two leaders may find themselves on very different pages and that could be a recipe for a problematic relationship. If this plays out, it would undermine peace and stability in North East Asia"". In Pyongyang, Kim Jong Un will no doubt be watching closely, keen to exploit the shifting ground. His nuclear weapons programme is more dangerous than ever, and nothing or no-one has been able to convince him to wind it down - including Donald Trump who, during his first term, was the first US president to ever meet a North Korean leader. Since returning to office Trump has indicated he would like to resume talks with Kim, which ended without agreement in 2019. In Seoul, there is real concern that this time the pair could strike a deal that is very bad for South Korea. The fear is that Trump would take an ""America first"" approach, and ask Kim to stop producing his intercontinental ballistic missiles that threaten the US mainland, without addressing the multiple short-range nuclear weapons pointed at Seoul. And in return, Kim could demand a high price. Kim has far more leverage than he did in 2019. He has more nuclear warheads, his weapons are more advanced, and the sanctions that were supposed to put pressure on his regime have all but collapsed, thanks largely to Vladimir Putin. The Russian leader is providing Kim with economic and military support in return for North Korea's help fighting the war in Ukraine. This therefore gives Kim the cover to make more audacious requests of the US. He could ask Trump to accept North Korea as a nuclear weapons state, and agree to a deal that would reduce Pyongyang's weapons count rather than get rid of them altogether. Another of his requests could likely be for the US to remove some of the security it provides South Korea, including the troops. ""North Korea is in the driver's seat now. The only curveball is how much risk President Trump will take"", said Sydney Seiler, who was involved in the 2019 negotiations on the US side. ""The idea there might be some sort of troop withdrawal [included in a deal] is really not that far-fetched"". Mr Seiler stressed that the US would ""not leave South Korea in the dust,"" but advised South Korea's new president to ""establish a relationship with Trump early on"", and be clear they expect to be part of any process, if talks materialise. The new president must move quickly on all fronts, added Mr Revere, arguing that Lee's first homework assignment should be to come up with a list of 10 reasons why South Korea is an indispensable partner and why American dollars are being well spent; reasons that can convince a sceptical and transactional Trump. One Ace card South Korea is hoping to play is its shipbuilding prowess. It builds more vessels than any other country bar China, which is now the world's dominant ship builder and home to the largest naval fleet. This is a frightening prospect for the US whose own industry and navy are in decline. Last month I visited South Korea's flagship shipyard in Ulsan on the south coast - the largest in the world – where Hyundai Heavy Industries builds 40-50 new ships a year, including naval destroyers. Sturdy cranes slotted together sheets of metal, creating vessels the size of small villages. Seoul is hoping it can use this expertise to build, repair and maintain warships for the US, and in the process convince Washington it is a valuable partner. ""US shipbuilding difficulties are affecting their national security"", said Jeong Woo Maan, head of strategy for Hyundai's naval and ship unit. ""This is one of the strongest cards we have to negotiate with"". In his campaign for president, Lee Jae-myung declared he did not want to rush into any agreements with Trump. Now in office, he could quickly find himself without this luxury.  Copyright 2025 BBC.

6/4/2025,Article,News,Deadly mushroom lunch cook tells court she threw up toxic meal,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yx7vewn75o,"An Australian woman on trial for murder says she threw up the toxic mushroom meal which killed her relatives, after binge eating dessert. Erin Patterson has pleaded not guilty to four charges - three of murder and one of attempted murder - over the beef Wellington lunch at her regional Victorian house in July 2023. Prosecutors allege Ms Patterson deliberately served toxic death cap mushrooms, but only to her guests. Her defence team say the contaminated meal was a tragic accident, and argue it had made their client sick too. Ms Patterson told the court she had only eaten a small part of lunch but later consumed two-thirds of a cake, before becoming ""over-full"" and vomiting. Doctors have previously told the trial Ms Patterson did not have the same intense symptoms as the other people who'd eaten at her house. On her third day of wide-ranging testimony, Ms Patterson also admitted she had lied about a cancer diagnosis - which prosecutors say she used to coax the guests to her house - instead of revealing she was actually planning to undergo weight-loss surgery. She said she had dumped a food dehydrator and wiped her phone in the days after the incident out of fear of being blamed for her relative's deaths, telling the court her estranged husband had accused her of poisoning them. Three people died in hospital in the days after the meal, including Ms Patterson's former in-laws, Don Patterson, 70, and Gail Patterson, 70, as well as Gail's sister, Heather Wilkinson, 66. A single lunch guest survived, 71-year-old local pastor Ian Wilkinson, after weeks of treatment in hospital. The Victorian Supreme Court trial - which started almost six weeks ago - has heard from more than 50 witnesses, and attracted huge global attention. In the Morwell courthouse, Ms Patterson gave a detailed account of the fatal lunch, saying she had invited her guests under the premise she wanted to talk about health issues.  The 14-member jury heard that Ms Patterson went through ""quite a long process of trying to decide what to cook"" for the lunch before choosing to make beef Wellington. The dish - usually prepared with a long strip of fillet steak, wrapped in pastry and mushrooms - was something Ms Patterson's mother made when she was a child, to mark special occasions, she said. After deciding the mushrooms she'd prepared tasted ""bland"", she said she'd added some dried ones - bought from an Asian grocer in Melbourne months earlier - from a container in her pantry.  Asked if that container may have had other types of mushrooms in it, Ms Patterson, choking up, said: ""Now I think there was a possibility that there were foraged ones in there as well."" Yesterday, the court heard that Ms Patterson had started hunting for mushrooms in locations close to her Leongatha home in 2020, and her long-standing love for fungi had expanded to include wild varieties as they had ""more flavour"".  Ms Patterson told the jury she had served up the food when it was ready, and instructed her guests to grab a plate themselves as she finished preparing gravy. There were no assigned seats or plates, she said. Mr Wilkinson previously told the trial the guests had each been given grey plates while Ms Patterson had eaten off an orange one. Ms Patterson on Wednesday said she didn't have any grey plates. During the lunch, Ms Patterson recalled that she didn't eat much of her food - ""a quarter, a third, somewhere around there"" - because she was busy talking.  She conceded she had told her guests she had cancer, but in court explained she told this lie to make sure she had help with childcare when she underwent gastric bypass surgery. ""I remember thinking I didn't want to tell anybody what I was going to have done. I was really embarrassed by it,"" she said. After the guests left, she cleaned up the kitchen and ate a slice of orange cake Gail had brought. ""[I ate] another piece of cake, and then another piece,"" she said, before finishing the rest of the dessert. ""I felt sick… over-full so I went to the toilets and brought it back up again."" ""After I'd done that, I felt better."" Yesterday, the court heard that Ms Patterson had secretly struggled with bulimia since her teens and was prone to regularly binge eating and vomiting after meals.  Ms Patterson told the court that she started to develop gastro-like symptoms hours after the lunch and took herself to hospital to ""get some fluids"" two days later. She was ""shocked but confused"" when medical staff asked if she could have eaten death cap mushrooms. While in hospital for observation overnight, Ms Patterson said her former husband Simon asked her about a dehydrator she owned. ""Is that how you poisoned my parents?"" she told the trial he'd said to her - something Mr Patterson denies.  After this encounter, she'd been ""frantic"", Ms Patterson said, and upon being sent home had disposed of her food dehydrator at the local tip. ""I had made the meal and served it and people had got sick."" ""I was scared that they would blame me for it."" The court also heard that Ms Patterson erased the data on one of her phones several times - including while police were searching her house - because she did not want detectives to see her photos of mushrooms and the dehydrator. Ms Patterson will continue giving evidence on Thursday, before prosecutors will have the opportunity to cross-examine her.  Copyright 2025 BBC.

6/4/2025,Article,News,The Indian pilot set for a historic space journey on Axiom-4,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce80glkl7nno,"The Axiom Mission 4 (Ax-4), set to take off from Nasa's Kennedy Space Center in Florida next week, will be piloted by an Indian as it soars towards the International Space Station (ISS). Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla of the Indian air force is among the four-member multi-country crew of Ax-4 that will be spending two weeks on the ISS. The flight, scheduled for 10 June at 08:22 EDT (12:22GMT; 17:52IST), has generated a huge interest in India as Group Captain Shukla will only be the second Indian ever to travel to space and the first to visit the ISS. The trip comes 41 years after cosmonaut Rakesh Sharma became the first Indian to fly to space aboard a Russian Soyuz in 1984. He spent nearly eight days there. Ax-4 is led by former Nasa astronaut Peggy Whitson - a space veteran who has been commander of ISS twice, spent hundreds of days in space and done 10 space walks.  The team also includes Slawosz Uznanski-Wisniewski from Poland and Tibor Kapu from Hungary - just like the Indian astronaut, they will also be taking their countries back to space after more than four decades.  Experts say the pilot's role is key, as he would serve as second-in-command to the mission commander, assisting with spacecraft operations during launch, docking, undocking and return to Earth. The astronauts, who have been in quarantine since 25 May to prepare for the trip, addressed a press conference on Tuesday night where they showed-off Joy - a small, white toy swan they said would be ""the fifth crew member"" on Ax-4. ""We are good for the launch, we have completed all the training and the team has bonded well,"" Commander Whitson said. Describing the past year as ""nothing short of transformative"" for him, Group Captain Shukla said he did not have words to describe his excitement. ""It has been an amazing journey so far, but the best is yet to come,"" he said.  ""As I go into space, I carry not just instruments and equipment, I carry hopes and dreams of a billion hearts. ""I request all Indians to pray for the success of our mission,"" he added. The 39-year-old was among four Indian air force officers shortlisted last year to travel on the country's first-ever human space flight, scheduled for 2027. The Gaganyaan mission aims to send three astronauts to an orbit of 400km and bring them back after three days. India has also announced ambitious plans to set up a space station by 2035 and send an astronaut to the Moon by 2040. India's space agency Isro has been carrying out a number of tests to prepare for Gaganyaan. In December, it plans to send a female humanoid robot to space as part of the tests. So, officials say the mission comes as a ""unique exciting opportunity"" for Isro and has generated a lot of interest in India. The trip to ISS aboard Ax-4 - a commercial flight operated by Houston-based private company Axiom Space - is a collaborative effort between Nasa, Isro and European Space Agency (Esa). Tuesday's flight will be launched using the SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule on a Falcon 9 rocket.  Isro, which has paid 5bn rupees ($59m; £43m) to secure a seat for Group Captain Shukla and his training, says the experience he will gain during his trip to the ISS will help India immensely. ""The benefit we will get from this mission is phenomenal in terms of the training, exposure to the facilities and the experience of jointly conducting experiments in space,"" Isro Chairman V Narayanan recently said. Sudeesh Balan, Isro project director, said Group Captain Shukla had been training since August last year.  ""He's undergone rigorous training, including physical and psychological assessments, to prepare for the journey."" Born on 10 October 1985 in the northern city of Lucknow, Group Captain Shukla joined the Indian air force as a fighter pilot in 2006.  According to Axiom Space, he has over 2,000 hours of flying experience and has flown MiGs, Sukhois, Dorniers, Jaguars and Hawks. His sister Shuchi Mishra, however, told the BBC that his entry into the air force was ""accidental"". ""When he was 17 and in high school, his friend got a form to apply to the National Defence Academy. But this friend was slightly overage so he was not qualified. Not wanting to waste the form, Shubhanshu filled it up,"" Ms Mishra said. ""He was selected - and has never looked back."" Ms Mishra says their family ""is thrilled as one of ours has been chosen out of India's 1.4 billion people"" for this mission. ""We all feel so privileged and proud that he's a part of our family and that we've been a part of his journey."" Her brother, she says, is undertaking this journey for his country - for the next generation. ""He always tells people to dream big, to do something for the nation. We are hoping that his trip will inspire the next generation."" Besides piloting the mission, the Indian astronaut will have a busy schedule during his time on ISS. Considering the huge interest in the flight, Isro has said they are organising events for him to interact with Indian students and answer their questions while floating in space. ""We believe it will motivate our young minds to become passionate about space tech,"" Mr Balan said. But most of the time, the four-member crew will be conducting 60 scientific experiments, seven of which come from India.  Former Nasa scientist Mila Mitra says Isro's experiments will help improve our understanding of space and its effects on biology and micro-gravity. One of the key experiments, she explains, will investigate the impact of spaceflight on six varieties of crop seeds.  ""This project aims to help understand how crops may be grown in space for future exploration missions. After the mission, seeds will be grown for multiple generations and plants showing preferred traits will be selected for genetic analyses."" Another Isro experiment involves growing three strains of microalgae which could be used as food, fuel or even in life support systems and this will help identify the most suitable ones for growing in microgravity, she says. The Isro projects would also investigate how tardigrades - micro-animals on Earth that can survive extreme environments - would fare in space.  ""The project will examine the revival of dormant tardigrades, count the number of eggs laid and hatched during a mission, and compare space-flown versus ground control populations,"" Ms Mitra says. The other experiments aim to identify how muscle loss occurs in space and how it can be treated; and the physical and cognitive impact of using computer screens in microgravity.  ""The research will study how gaze fixation and rapid eye movements are affected by being in space, and how this may affect an astronaut's stress and wellbeing. The results could influence future spacecraft computer design and interaction,"" she says. Follow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook. Copyright 2025 BBC.

6/4/2025,Article,News,"Teen TikTok star shot dead after man broke into her home, police say",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g7v1evrmdo,"A 22-year-old man has been arrested in Pakistan and confessed to the murder of 17-year-old social media influencer Sana Yousaf, according to police.  Authorities say they believe Umar Hayat murdered Ms Yousaf at her home in Islamabad on Monday after she rejected what they called his ""offers of friendship"". He allegedly also repeatedly tried, and failed, to meet her.  They say he broke into her home, fired two shots, stole her phone and fled.  Ms Yousaf's father, Syed Yousaf Hassan, told the BBC she was his only daughter, and was ""very brave"". Her family have gathered in Chitral, where Ms Yousaf has been buried. Mr Yousaf said she had never mentioned Hayat, nor any threatening behaviour, before she was killed.  He said Ms Yousaf's aunt was at the family home when the suspect broke in, and that he had also threatened to shoot her before fleeing.  Ms Yousaf died before she could be taken to the hospital. Police said the ""brutal"" murder caused ""a wave of concern"" across the country, and that there was ""immense"" pressure to find the killer.  They raided locations across the capital and the province of Punjab and scanned footage from 113 CCTV cameras.  The suspected murder weapon and Ms Yousaf's phone have since been recovered. Ms Yousaf already had a wide following in Pakistan, with half a million fans on Instagram before her death. Condolences have flooded her social media pages.  Her TikTok account gained hundreds of thousands of followers overnight, and now stands at more than a million. Her last video on Instagram, posted last week, showed her surrounded by balloons and cutting a cake for her birthday. Given her high profile in Pakistan, news of Ms Yousaf's death spread quickly in local news media and on social media platforms. It's also ignited a fierce debate about women on social media. While many have shared their outrage at news of Ms Yousaf's death, there has also been backlash towards her work as an influencer. Digital rights advocacy group Bolo Bhi has been monitoring the online reaction, and its director Usama Khilji said such criticism had been coming from a small portion of mostly male internet users - some of whom have cited religious grounds.  ""They're asking why she was putting up all this content, and even suggesting the family should take down her Instagram and TikTok accounts because they add to her 'sins',"" Mr Khilji explained. Dr Farzana Bari, a prominent human rights activist, argued the reaction is ""misogynistic"" and ""patriarchal"". She said Ms Yousaf had ""her own voice"", and that the discourse online is a reminder that social media has become a ""very threatening place for female content creators"" in Pakistan. The Inspector General of Police for Islamabad, Syed Ali Nasir Rizvi, said women who choose to become social media influencers ""deserve our encouragement and support"". He added Ms Yousaf's murder was ""tragic"". Dr Bari said authorities condemning the incident publicly was a positive sign that could lead to change. The arrested suspect is the son of a former public servant. He is from the town of Faisalabad, in the province of Punjab, according to police. Copyright 2025 BBC.

6/4/2025,Article,News,Musk calls Trump's tax bill a 'disgusting abomination' ,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0j76djzgpvo,"Elon Musk hit out at US President Donald Trump's signature tax and spending bill again on Wednesday, calling on Americans to tell their representatives in Washington to ""kill the bill"".  The budget, which includes huge tax breaks and more defence spending, was passed by the House of Representatives last month and is now being considered by senators. The tech billionaire wrote on X earlier this week that the bill would add to the US budget deficit and saddle Americans with ""crushing"" debt. On Tuesday, he described it as a ""disgusting abomination"", in a widening rift between the two. The bill has the backing of Trump and would be the legislative linchpin of his second-term agenda if it passes Congress.  ""Shame on those who voted for it,"" Musk said on Tuesday, hinting that he may try to unseat the politicians responsible at next year's midterm elections.  Musk left the administration abruptly last week after 129 days working to cut costs with his team, known as Doge. The comments mark his first public disagreement with Trump since leaving government, after having previously called the plan ""disappointing"".  Soon after Musk's tweet on Wednesday, the White House sent out a ""myth buster"" statement, calling any assertion that the bill would lead to higher deficits a ""hoax"". ""By every honest metric, President Donald J Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill dramatically improves the fiscal trajectory of the United States and unleashes an era of unprecedented economic growth,"" the statement reads.  It made no mention of Musk or his tweets. The BBC has contacted the White House for comment.  The South African-born tech billionaire's time in the Trump administration came to an end on 31 May, although Trump said that ""he will, always, be with us, helping all the way"".   In its current form, the bill - which Trump refers to as the ""big beautiful bill"" - has been estimated to increase the budget deficit (the difference between what the government spends and the revenue it receives) by about $600bn (£444bn) in the next fiscal year. In a series of posts on X on Tuesday, Musk said that the ""outrageous, pork-filled"" spending bill will ""massively increase the already gigantic budget deficit to $2.5 trillion (!!!) and burden America [sic] citizens with crushingly unsustainable debt"". In US politics, ""pork"" refers to spending on projects in lawmakers' constituencies. Musk has previously vowed to fund campaign challenges against any Republican that votes against Trump's agenda. But on Tuesday, he fired a warning to those who backed the bill.  ""In November next year, we fire all politicians who betrayed the American people,"" he wrote. Asked about Musk's comments soon after the first post, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said ""the president already knows where Elon Musk stood on this bill"".  ""This is one, big, beautiful bill,"" she added. ""And he's sticking to it.""  The legislation also pledges to extend soon-to-expire tax cuts passed during the first Trump administration in 2017, as well as an influx of funds for defence spending and to fund the administration's mass deportations of undocumented immigrants.  To the dismay of fiscal conservatives, it would lift the limit on the amount of money the government can borrow, known as the debt ceiling, to $4tn.  The comments from Musk reflect wider tensions among Republicans over the plan, which faced stiff opposition from different wings of the party as it worked its way through the House.  The Senate has now taken it up, and divisions are already emerging in that chamber, which is also narrowly controlled by Republicans. Kentucky Senator Rand Paul has said over the last few days he will not support the bill if it raises the debt ceiling. ""The GOP [the Republican Party] will own the debt once they vote for this,"" he told CBS News, the BBC's US partner, over the weekend.  Trump responded to Paul with a series of social media posts, accusing him of having ""very little understanding of the bill"" and saying that the ""people of Kentucky can't stand him"".  ""His ideas are actually crazy,"" Trump wrote.  Republican lawmakers pushed back on Musk's comments, with Senate majority leader John Thune saying the party plans to ""proceed full speed ahead"" despite ""a difference of opinion"".   Thune and other senators met Trump for a ""positive discussion"" on Wednesday, he told reporters at the White House. He downplayed Musk's posts, saying it would do little to scupper the work of lawmakers.  ""We are moving forward,"" he said, also adding that ""the wheels are in motion,"" and that ""failure is not an option"". Mike Johnson - the Republican Speaker who has ushered the legislation through the House - told reporters on Capitol Hill that ""my friend Elon is terribly wrong"".  ""It's a very important first start. Elon is missing it,"" Johnson said.  Johnson said he had a 20-minute phone call with the tycoon about the bill on Monday, adding that its phasing out of electric vehicle tax credits could ""have an effect"" on Tesla, Musk's firm.  ""I lament that,"" Johnson said, expressing surprise that Musk criticised the bill despite their call. ""I just deeply regret he's made this mistake.” Among the issues that upset Musk involved air traffic control at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), according to Axios.  Musk was hoping it would be run on his Starlink satellite system, but he was denied because of issues relating to the technology and the appearance of a conflict of interest, the political outlet reported.  Some Democrats welcomed Musk’s comments despite their previous criticism of him and the work of Doge.  ""Even Elon Musk, who's been part of the whole process, and is one of Trump's buddies, said the bill is bad,"" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said. ""We can imagine how bad this bill is.""  Trump and Republicans in Congress have set a deadline of 4 July to get the measure passed and signed into law. Musk supported Trump in last year's November election with donations of more than $250m.  To make peace with spending hawks, Trump is also asking Congress to pass a plan that would reduce current spending by $9.4bn, a figure derived from Doge's work. It would mainly slash funding for foreign aid, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and for broadcasters NPR and PBS.

6/4/2025,Article,News,Indigenous lawyer leads race for chief justice in Mexico,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c14k56dmxx7o,"An indigenous lawyer, Hugo Aguilar, looks set to become Mexico's new chief justice following Sunday's ground-breaking judicial election. Mexicans were asked to choose the country's entire judiciary by direct ballot for the first time after a radical reform introduced by the governing Morena party. With almost all the votes for the Supreme Court counted, Mr Aguilar was in the lead for the top post. President Claudia Sheinbaum declared the elections a success, even though turnout was low at around 13%.  Electoral authorities said Mr Aguilar, who is a member of the Mixtec indigenous group, was ahead of Lenia Batres, the candidate who had the backing of the governing Morena party.  Hugo Aguilar has long campaigned for the rights of Mexico's indigenous groups, which make up almost 20% of the population according to the 2020 census in which people were asked how the identified themselves.   For the past seven years, the 51-year-old constitutional law expert has served as the rights co-ordinator for the National Institute of Indigenous Peoples (INPI). He was also a legal advisor to the Zapatista Army of National Liberation (EZLN) - an indigenous guerrilla group which staged a short-lived uprising in southern Chiapas state in 1994 - during the EZLN's negotiations with the government in 1996. During his campaign for the post of chief justice he had said that it was ""the turn of the indigenous and Afro-Mexican peoples to take a seat in the Supreme Court"", accusing the highest court of being stuck in the past and wedded to ""principles which don't drive real change for the people"". Candidates with links to the governing Morena party look set to win the majority of the remaining eight posts on the Supreme Court, according to early results. Critics of the judicial reform which led to the direct election of all the country's judges say the dominance of the governing party is undermining the judiciary's independence. Those who backed the reform argued that it would make the judiciary more democratic and beholden to voters. However, the turnout was the lowest in any federal vote held in Mexico, suggesting that there was little enthusiasm among voters for choosing members of the judiciary directly.  Copyright 2025 BBC.

6/4/2025,Article,News,Analysis: Tariff relief for UK but new clock ticking on US deal,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy6xz76z32o,"It is hard to argue the UK exemption from the doubling of US tariffs on imported steel from 25 to 50% is not good news.  It was not a given that the UK would get this carve-out despite having done a deal on 8 May to reduce tariffs on the metals to zero. That agreement is not yet in force, however, and speaking to steel industry leaders and government officials right up until Tuesday night's announcement, their working assumption was that the UK would be in the same boat as everyone else - facing tariffs of 50% until that deal was finalised.  There was a palpable sense of relief from UK trade officials when the exemption was included in President Donald Trump's latest executive order. Up until that point, the UK government didn't actually know whether it would receive special treatment. It found out the same time everyone else did, and managed to avoid what would have been a somewhat diplomatically embarrassing episode after hailing the tariff pact as ""historic"". Having said that there is now a new clock ticking. Tuesday's announcement contained a provision that if the deal is not finalised by 9 July, the UK's steel tariff rate would be hiked to 50%.  So now you have an uncertain period when businesses on both sides of the Atlantic don't know if the tariff will be zero or 50% in five weeks' time - which anecdotally is having a corrosive effect on business. There is no reason to assume the deal won't come into force. The government said that Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer agreed that both would work faster so customers in US and UK benefit from the agreement. However, there is a second-order effect - that international steel earmarked for the US could now be diverted to the UK and create a glut of the metal and undercut domestic steelmakers.  The industry has been quick to voice such concerns and wants the government to implement barriers of its own to prevent that. The UK exemption and ultimate deal is not a free lunch. The UK government agreed to cut tariffs cut on some US beef products and ethanol - a renewable fuel made from crops. It has created a crisis in the UK ethanol market, which in turn is a big customer of wheat farmers. It is possible that UK efforts to protect these industries could be viewed by the US as backsliding on the deal they struck with the UK. It's a reminder that these deals have complex and sometimes underestimated knock on effects. Copyright 2025 BBC.

6/4/2025,Article,News,TikTok blocks searches for extreme thinness 'skinnytok' hashtag,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gr6q6256do,"TikTok is preventing users searching for ""skinnytok"" - a hashtag which critics say directs people towards content which ""idolises extreme thinness."" Content associated with the hashtag includes videos showing people's work-out routines or what they eat in a day.  TikTok said it had ""blocked search results for #skinnytok since it has become linked to unhealthy weight loss content."" People using the hashtag will now be redirected to mental health support resources instead. Tom Quinn, from the eating disorder charity, Beat, welcomed the move saying ""skinnytok"" and related content could have ""devastating"" impacts on ""struggling"" people. However, he stressed there was more to do. ""We know that users will very often find workarounds to content blocks and there will still be damaging content which isn't shared under the ""skinnytok"" umbrella, which TikTok and other social media platforms must now address,"" he told BBC News. According to the US-based National Alliance for Eating Disorders, the skinnytok hashtag has more than half a million posts associated with it. It says the hashtag includes content such as low-calorie recipes which on the face of it appear to promote healthy lifestyle advice. But the organisation says, in reality, it ""glorifies thinness and vilifies weight gain"" and ""promotes disordered eating behaviours."" The  trend has caused particular alarm in France, where experts have warned of how social media can push vulnerable young people towards developing eating disorders. ""The patients are completely indoctrinated -- and my 45-minute weekly consultation is no match for spending hours every day on TikTok,"" the nutritionist Carole Copti told the AFP news agency. The blocking of the hashtag has been celebrated by France's digital minister, who wrote on social media that ""skinnytok is over"" thanks to lobbying by European politicians.  In its statement, TikTok said it regularly reviewed its safety measures to ""address evolving risks"". ""We continue to restrict videos from teen accounts and provide health experts and information in TikTok Search,"" it added. It is not the first time TikTok has been forced to take action over content which raised body image concerns. In March, it blocked so-called ""chubby filters"" - a viral tool which made people appear overweight. Sign up for our Tech Decoded newsletter to follow the world's top tech stories and trends.

6/4/2025,Article,News,'I need a hug' - Singer Jessie J says she has breast cancer,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy3ve0rrlro,"Singer Jessie J says she has been diagnosed with early breast cancer. The star, 37, revealed the diagnosis on Instagram saying she was planning on having surgery after her performance at Capital's Summertime Ball, a mini-festival at London's Wembley Stadium, later this month. The Price Tag singer noted she had been ""in and out of tests"" in recent times. ""Cancer sucks in any form, but I'm holding on to the word 'early',"" she said in a video message. ""It's a very dramatic way to get a boob job,"" she joked. ""I am going to disappear for a bit after Summertime Ball to have my surgery, and I will come back with massive tits and more music."" The Essex singer, who was announced on Tuesday as one of the acts on the bill at September's Radio 2 in the Park music festival, added that she was going public with the diagnosis in order to help her to process it, and also to show solidarity with others going through something similar. ""I just wanted to be open and share it,"" she continued. ""One, because, selfishly, I do not talk about it enough. I'm not processing it because I'm working so hard. ""I also know how much sharing in the past has helped me with other people giving me their love and support and also their own stories. I'm an open book. ""It breaks my heart that so many people are going through so much similar and worse - that's the bit that kills me."" The performer, who gave birth to a son in 2023, went on to say the diagnosis had given her ""incredible perspective"". ""But honestly I need to process it and talk about it and, I need a hug,"" she told fans. ""You have loved me through all my good and hard times. And I don't want this to be any different."" TV and radio presenter Gaby Roslin replied in the comments, offering ""so much love and enormous hugs"". Fellow pop star Rita Ora replied: ""You're literally my favourite person and I'm praying for you, you've got this. ""My mother had it and I know the surgery and any treatment on this matter is mentally tough so I'm here for you. X."" The likes of Leigh-Anne Pinnock, Leona Lewis, Rochelle and Marvin Humes also offered their support, as well as Wretch 32 and Paloma Faith. CEO of Breast Cancer UK, Thalie Martini, told BBC News that Jessie J's ""openness is inspiring and offers a powerful reminder of the importance of early detection, education and prevention."" ""We fully support those who take further preventative measures due to early diagnosis or a genetic predisposition,"" she added; while urging people to reduce their risk by ""maintaining a healthy diet, staying active and reducing alcohol consumption"". Breast cancer is the most common type of cancer in women in the UK. According the NHS website: ""It's important to check your breasts regularly so you know what's normal for you. ""This makes it easier to notice any changes in the size, look or feel of your breasts."" Jessie J has had health issues throughout her life, being diagnosed with a heart condition as a child before going on to have a stroke as a teenager and briefly going deaf in 2020 due to Meniere's disease. Last year she revealed she had been diagnosed with ADHD and OCD. The singer's latest announcement comes after she recently told BBC Radio 2 breakfast show host Scott Mills she had turned down a major Broadway role, playing Sally Bowles in Cabaret. ""I recently got offered a huge role on Broadway but I turned it down because it wasn't the right time,"" she explained. ""My son was too young and I just couldn't.""  Underlining her background and training in musical theatre, she added: ""I will do it at some point, and it was an amazing audition process and I was so proud that I got it."" Copyright 2025 BBC.

6/4/2025,Article,News,Meghan shares new photos of Lilibet to mark fourth birthday,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cewd79ey270o,"The Duchess of Sussex has posted a video of her dancing while pregnant with Princess Lilibet four years ago to mark her daughter's birthday.  The video features Meghan and the Duke of Sussex dance and gyrate in a hospital room.  The couple were recreating a TikTok challenge which sees pregnant women and their partners dance to a song called Baby Mama Dance.  She wrote on Instagram: ""Four years ago today, this also happened. Both of our children were a week past their due dates... so when spicy food, all that walking, and acupuncture didn't work - there was only one thing left to do!"" It is not known if the dance challenge, created by comic Cameron Henderson in 2013 and includes the lyrics ""been pregnant for way too long"", did indeed induce Meghan's labour.  The post came after a series of posts by the duchess sharing intimate family photos of four-year-old Princess Lilibet.  Meghan shared a black-and-white snap of her cuddling her daughter, who is sitting on her lap, with the pair both sporting windswept hair, appearing to be on a boat.  The second image shows Meghan tenderly cradling the princess as a newborn following her birth in 2021.  Meghan wrote: ""Happy birthday to our beautiful girl! Four years ago today she came into our lives – and each day is brighter and better because of it. ""Thanks to all of those sending love and celebrating her special day!"" The duchess also released an image of a newborn Princess Lillibet looking up at her father.  Another image shows the duke and his daughter in a dress walking bare feet in the sand, with their backs turned to the camera, surrounded by palm trees.  ""The sweetest bond to watch unfold,"" she said of the pictures. ""Daddy's little girl and favourite adventurer. Happy birthday Lili!"" Meghan usually only shares photos of the princess pictured from behind to protect her privacy, but in one of the newly released photos you can see Lilibet's eyes and top half of her face, with the bottom half covered by Meghan's arms as she hugs her daughter.  The princess - the youngest child of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex - was born on 4 June 2021, a year after her parents stepped back from being senior royals and moved to the US. She became a princess when her grandfather the King became monarch.  The couple also share Prince Archie, aged six.   On Tuesday, Meghan said she wondered about launching a future business with her daughter as she chatted to Beyonce's mother Tina Knowles on her podcast Confessions Of A Female Founder.  ""I wonder if one day I'll be in business with Lili and we'll be building something,"" the duchess said, with Knowles adding: ""That's the best."" Last week, the duchess shared a clip of her and the princess beekeeping in protective suits, writing: ""Like mother, like daughter; she's even wearing my gloves.""  Lilibet is named after her great-grandmother Queen Elizabeth II.  The nickname was coined when then-Princess Elizabeth was a toddler and could not pronounce her own name properly.  Her grandfather King George V would affectionately call her Lilibet, imitating her attempts to say her name. It stuck and came to be used by close relatives.

6/4/2025,Article,Culture,Five works that reveal Banksy's hidden philosophy,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20250602-five-works-that-reveal-the-philosophy-of-banksy,"Banksy's new mural in Marseille is not the first image he has connected to the history of ideas. From Plato to Foucault, a Banksy expert reveals the philosophy behind these popular artworks. Which is the real you, the person you are now or the one you are capable of becoming? It's a heady question, to be sure, and not one you would expect to be confronted with while strolling down a street in Marseille in the waning days of May. Yet it's precisely the existential dilemma that Banksy, who once asserted ""being yourself is overrated"" – has surreptitiously installed in a cloistered stretch of the quiet Rue Félix Fregier, the site of a new work – the latest installment in the elusive artist's decades-long career as a provocative philosophical prankster.  For more than 30 years, Banksy has spiked many of his most iconic works – from his girl reaching hopelessly for a heart-shaped balloon to his masked rioter hurling a bouquet of flowers – with barbed allusions to Old Masters, from Michelangelo to Monet, Vermeer to Van Gogh. But there's more. Beneath his stealthy stencils lies a deep and deliberate engagement with the history of ideas as well, from classical Stoicism to postmodern deconstructionism. On 29 May, Banksy posted on Instagram a photo of his first new piece in more than five months, piquing the internet's interest by withholding its precise location. Discovered shortly thereafter in the major port city in southern France, Marseille, the mural is, at first glance, deceptively simple: a tall silhouette of a lighthouse spray-painted on to a blank beige urban wall; a rusting street bollard positioned nearby; and a painted shadow stretching across the pavement, joining the real-world object to its augmented, if two-dimensional, echo. Stencilled across the black lighthouse are the words: ""I want to be what you saw in me.""  Anyone keen to find a source for the ideas that inform Banksy's new work needs merely to flip open any history of philosophy to Plato's seminal allegory of the cave (from the Fourth-Century BC treatise The Republic), then flip the ancient metaphor on its head. In Plato's parable, prisoners chained inside a cave mistake shadows on the wall for reality, unaware of the truer forms that cast them outside. But here, Banksy, being Banksy, baits us by switching the set-up, reversing the relationship between essence and shadow. In Banksy's mural, the drab bollard casts not a diminished imitation of itself, but something far grander – a lighthouse, a symbol of illumination and guidance. Here, it's the silhouette, not reality, that's true. Banksy's inversion urges us to ask where reality really resides: in what is, or in what might be? His poignant phrase – ""I want to be what you saw in me"" – is alluringly elastic. Is this the bollard dreaming of being more than it appears? Or the shadow wishing to become light? Or is it all of us – Banksy included – struggling to live up to the better versions imagined by those who believe in us? The answer is surely yes to all of the above. And it's a yes too to the question: 'is this new work a lamp capable of shining light on further levels of meaning in Banksy?' What follows is a brief look back at some of the artist's best-known works and how they too are invigorated by, and often upend, many of the most important philosophical tenets – both social and intellectual – that underwrite who we are and who we might be. Banksy's new mural in Marseille is not the first to be accompanied by an affecting caption connecting the piece to the history of ideas. Among his most famous murals, Girl with Balloon, which portrays a child reaching towards a heart-shaped balloon drifting away from her, first appeared in 2002 in various locations in London, including on the South Bank, alongside the consoling assertion, ""there is always hope"". That conviction, which fuels the ceaseless striving for an ideal that is seemingly unobtainable in the mural (there's no way that balloon is coming back) rhymes richly with aspects of 19th-Century German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer's ideas concerning an unquenchable and irrational ""Will"" as a fundamental force that drives humanity. When, years later, Banksy mischievously concealed a remote-controlled shredder in the frame of a version of Girl with Balloon that came up for auction in 2018, and sensationally destroyed the work before the eyes of aghast auction-goers, he succeeded in upping the ante on Schopenhauer's belief in the futility of desire by boldly manifesting it himself. Where there's a will there's a fray. Banksy's famous mural of a masked man frozen forever in the instant before he unleashes not a brick or a bomb but a bouquet of flowers may seem, at first blush, to exemplify a pacifist's commitment to peaceful disobedience. The work appears to echo the precepts of Mahatma Gandhi's Satyagraha – a philosophy of non-violence that the Indian ethicist coined in 1919. Banksy's fully flexed figure, incongruously armed with a fistful of beauty, appears to epitomise Gandhi's insistence on wielding moral, not physical, strength. Doesn't it? Or has Banksy slyly subverted the philosophical assertion of pacifistic force by portraying his hero as an enraged rioter? The figure's anger has not been tempered by an appeal to the higher ideals of beauty and truth. Instead, those ideals have been weaponised by Banksy. Here, beauty and truth are not disarming, they are devastatingly explosive. Banksy's mural in Marseille employs a tried-and-true technique to ensure the work protrudes into the urban space in which we'll encounter it – elevating its philosophical potential from something flimsy and flat to something undeniably urgent. It's a tactic he used in a 2007 work that appeared near London's Oxford Street in which he depicts a boy atop a precariously high ladder, spray-painting the penetrating observation that we are ""One Nation Under CCTV"" in outlandishly outsized letters. Also portrayed within the mural is a uniformed officer and his obedient police dog who surveil the young vandal, while above them all an actual CCTV camera, presumably recording everything, juts out from the wall. The endless layers of surveillance-within-surveillance to which the work attests – as we watch the state watch an officer watch the boy – captures with uncanny precision the philosophical contours of the vast and all-encompassing prison machine in which the French poststructural philosopher Michel Foucault believed everyone in society was now irredeemably enmeshed. In Foucault's study Discipline and Punish: The Birth of the Prison, he resuscitates a blueprint for a prison proposed by the British utilitarian philosopher Jeremy Bentham at the end of the 18th Century, ""The Panopticon"" (meaning ""all seeing""), and uses it as a menacing metaphor for how no one can escape the perniciously penetrating eye of the panoptical state.  Banksy's witty 2014 work Mobile Lovers shines a chilling light on the state of contemporary relationships. The mural depicts a couple whose almost affectionate embrace is interrupted by the deeper fondness they have for the warm glow of their smartphones. The French existentialist philosopher Simone de Beauvoir, who died in 1986, may not have lived long enough to witness the emergence of mobiles. Yet her profoundly influential 1947 book The Ethics of Ambiguity – published exactly 60 years before the iPhone was launched in 2007 – with its exploration of the devastation that detachment and disconnection can wreak on the realisation of our truest selves, is profoundly proleptic of our modern predicament. To be free, de Beauvoir insisted, requires a deep attentiveness to each other. She believed in the authenticity of human encounters, without which life is a futile performance, dimly lit by disposable devices, rather than something profound and meaningful.  How Banksy Saved Art History by Kelly Grovier, published by Thames & Hudson, is out now. -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.

6/4/2025,Article,Travel,Road-tripping Canada's forgotten coastline,https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20250603-the-great-iceberg-hunt-on-canadas-epic-new-road,"A sweeping new highway – nearly 25 years and C$1bn in the making – is reshaping life in Newfoundland and Labrador and opening up Canada's iceberg coast. Standing on a windswept outcrop on the island of Newfoundland's northern coast, I scanned the churning, blue-steel sea for icebergs. Somewhere beyond the restless waves lay the glaciers of Greenland and the ice fields of Arctic Canada. I was hoping to glimpse their offspring – behemoths calved from ancient ice shelves, carried south over two or three years by the Baffin Island and Labrador Currents into a region known as Iceberg Alley, a stretch of water between the southern coast of Labrador and the south-eastern shore of Newfoundland. Squinting, I caught sight of a solid white shape; a still patch in the Labrador Sea. For a heartbeat, I thought I'd found one. Then it vanished in a burst of froth and spray. My husband Evan and I continued along the rocky trail, ducking out of the wind behind a patch of tangled tuckamore. Made up of hardy, slow-growing boreal trees like balsam fir and black spruce, the wind-contorted forest barely reached my chin. Up ahead, Evan pointed out an osprey, fragile and exposed, as it spread its wings to dry. Beyond it, the ocean vista was punctuated by sea stacks, sculpted cliffs and a small, curved bay dotted with abandoned homes. Despite the blue sky and warmth of late spring, life in Newfoundland and Labrador demands ingenuity and resilience. Like the meadow grasses and wildflowers clinging to the salt-laced soil, the people here have only ever held a precarious grip on this wondrous place. I inhaled deeply, marvelling at the austere beauty – then another glint of white caught my eye. ""Only a boat,"" Evan said, following my gaze. One week into a two-week road trip across Newfoundland, we had yet to spot an iceberg. They were out there; each morning, the iceberg-tracking map showed giants drifting to our west. The problem was geography. Newfoundland and Labrador's pleated coastline means a berg 50km away by water could be 400km by road – and this season, they were clustered in the southern bays of Labrador, a region that was, until recently, among the hardest to reach. The Open Road is a celebration of the world's most remarkable highways and byways, and a reminder that some of the greatest travel adventures happen via wheels. In a place where the ocean long served as the main highway, roads came late. When Newfoundland joined Canada in 1949, there were just 195km of pavement for a province with more than 29,000km of coastline. The obvious solution was to build roads, with the goal of improving access to jobs, schools and healthcare. But this came at a cost. Building takes time and the initial roadways bypassed many small coastal settlements, leading to the abandonment of more than 300 outport communities. ""But a new road can change everything,"" Keith Pike, the city manager in Red Bay, an outport on Labrador's southern coast told me, after I'd continued my trip west. Just 80km north of the Quebec border and the Newfoundland-Labrador ferry terminal in Blanc-Sablon, Red Bay hugs the edge of the Strait of Belle Isle. Not long ago it also marked the end of the old gravel road; isolation that forced Pike to leave the place his family had called home for generations. But with the recent completion of the Trans-Labrador Highway – known as Expedition 51 for the latitude it follows – he has returned, and is hopeful others might do the same. The 1,200km highway, nearly 25 years and C$1bn in the making, threads across Labrador's sweeping terrain, linking inland towns, distant outports and more than 9,000 years of human history. It's the kind of rugged drive that road-trippers dream of, forming a loop through Quebec, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and even touching into the US and the French islands of St Pierre and Miquelon. While only a few people are expected to drive the entire circuit, Pike sees the road's greatest legacy in its promise. ""People like me are able to come home because of the opportunities it's creating,"" he said. In simple terms: the places Newfoundlanders and Labradorians call home have proven to be alluring to travellers looking for wild landscapes and meaningful cultural encounters. And along Expedition 51, visitors aren't just welcome, they're needed. It's a place where thoughtful tourism can help sustain places that have endured against the odds. In Indigenous communities, the road is already sparking new ventures. Barbara Young, marketing coordinator for the Newfoundland and Labrador Indigenous Tourism Association, says local entrepreneurs are building businesses rooted in tradition. From guided hikes with Kaumanik Adventure Tours in Port Hope Simpson to Inuit art at Caribou Place in Mary's Harbour, these stops invite travellers to engage with cultures that have thrived here since time immemorial. History, too, is central to Red Bay's story. A major Basque whaling station in the 1500s, the long-abandoned settlement grew out of the whale oil that once lit Europe's lamps. Today, Parks Canada and the townspeople are betting on the new highway drawing more visitors to the Red Bay National Historic Site. They've invested in a new interpretive centre, expanded boardwalks through Saddle Island's archeological sites and improved hikes like the Boney Shore Trail where whale bones still line the coast. More like this: • Canada's remote (but accessible) dark-sky sanctuary • A cutting-edge tourism model in Newfoundland • The only land disputed between the US and Canada As Evan and I chased icebergs, I realised Expedition 51 is also opening more of Iceberg Alley. New operators like Whaler's Quest Ocean Adventures now offer boat tours out of Red Bay, often with a side of traditional music by locals like Pike. It may seem ironic that a seafaring province closely associated with the Titanic – just one of the more than 600 documented ship-iceberg collisions that have claimed more than 3,400 lives over the past two centuries – is embracing iceberg tourism. Back when most communities relied on the cod fishery, the massive bergs that drifted by each spring were deadly navigational hazards. But as coastal populations dwindled, the icy giants offered a glimmer of hope. Twillingate was one of the first to embrace the shift. Straddling two islands linked by a narrow tickle, and just 100km from Gander's airport, Twillingate gained road access in the 1970s. After the cod fishery collapsed in the 1990s, the town began to reinvent itself. Locals transformed old footpaths – once used to reach now-abandoned communities or favourite berry-picking patches – into hiking trails, launched iceberg tours and started businesses like Great Auk Winery, which uses iceberg water in its products. Drawn to the now-famous town, Evan and I continued our daily scan of iceberg-tracking sites. Even though the icebergs drifted stubbornly west, locals helped us build a very Newfoundland bucket list. We were directed to puffin and whale lookouts, tipped off about the perfect fog-free window for visiting the lighthouse, told where to buy fresh-caught lobster, sent to see several root cellars and urged to visit the Beothuk Interpretation Centre to learn about the tragic demise of the Indigenous Beothuk people. On the hiking trails, we reflected on the empty outports and watched for untracked icebergs. ""They've given people a reason to come home,"" an employee at Great Auk Winery told us as we sampled a flight of wines. The bakeapple iceberg wine – infused with golden-orange berries handpicked from nearby bogs – offered a honeyed apricot note. Blended with harvested iceberg water, it showcased how seafaring traditions are being reimagined. We bought a bottle; even if we didn't spot one of the elusive giants, we could still savour the taste of 50,000-year-old water. In a typical year, 700 to 800 icebergs drift through Iceberg Alley; some years, none appear at all. I had nearly given up when I glimpsed my first one at Red Bay. Floating offshore from Expedition 51, the glittering hulk told the story of a snowflake's improbable journey from cloud to glacier to sea to tourist attraction. It had taken thousands of years to get here – but without the new highway, I wouldn't have seen it at all. -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.   For more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.  Copyright 2025 BBC.

6/4/2025,Article,Travel,Africa's ice cream cafe that nurtures self-esteem,https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20250521-africas-ice-cream-cafe-that-nurtures-self-esteem,"Tapi Tapi makes ice cream with a deep mission: to soothe the collective souls of African people by sharing folk traditions, rituals and cultures through food. Located in Cape Town's artistic centre of Observatory, Lower Main Road offers a fascinating array of thrift stores, cafes and restaurants best explored on foot. Among them is an unassuming ice cream cafe called Tapi Tapi (a Bantu ideophone [nyaudzosingwi] that means ""sweet sweet"") whose calligraphy-clad, alley-style entrance serves as an invitation to simply pay attention.  That's because Tapi Tapi is no ordinary ice cream cafe. With a firm focus on rehabilitating the collective self-esteem of African people by sharing folk traditions, rituals and cultures through food practices, all its ice creams are handmade in small batches with ingredients typically communally sourced from the gardens of friends and patrons.  Over the course of each month, you may find a curated menu of ice cream flavours that includes amagwinya (a deep-fried dough from South Africa), kelewele (an ensemble of caramelised plantain, ginger and fire-roasted peanut from Ghana), and nhopi (a roasted pumpkin and dark chocolate pairing common in Zimbabwe). In the next month, the menu might feature flavours like thiakry (a millet couscous and sour milk pairing from West Africa), mbwire mbwire (roasted sorghum biscuits from Zimbabwe), and mowa, an amaranth greens and yellow plum vegan dish that is enjoyed across the continent. No flavours are ever repeated.  Founder Tapiwa Guzha says that Tapi Tapi started as a ""self-imposed dare"" that was largely inspired by childhood memories of lingering in his grandmother's kitchen whenever desserts were being prepared. Born and raised in Zimbabwe, Guzha moved to South Africa in 2005 to study at the University of Cape Town and went on to earn his PhD in molecular biology in 2014. The following year, he began his postdoctoral fellowship in Stellenbosch, a wine oasis in South Africa's Western Cape province, where he recalls seeing a trilingual sign for the first time. ""The default is Afrikaans and English for building signs, room names and that kind of thing,"" he says, ""but the first time I saw a third language was Xhosa [a Bantu language], and it was a 'trespassers will be prosecuted' sign.""    This sparked an internal dialogue in which Guzha began to process the realities of being a black person in South Africa, where despite more than 80% of the population being black, the minority white population still holds the majority of all economic power. This led to increasingly nuanced explorations of different worldviews, which prize Western knowledge systems and food cultures over those of Indigenous people, and simultaneously, interrogations into the parallels between African cosmology and Western science. ""I remember thinking about the difference between a rainmaker [a spiritual intermediary in various African traditions who requests rain through ritual] and a meteorologist. I don't necessarily believe in the ability to conjure up rain from nowhere, but I do believe in the ability to understand weather patterns and using that knowledge to drive a narrative in whatever context – but one system is not as valued as the other one,"" he says.   BBC.com's World's Table ""smashes the kitchen ceiling"" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future. Guzha remembers traveling from Cape Town to Stellenbosch and witnessing the lush vineyard and cascading mountain landscapes of the Cape Winelands, and the contrasting, painful realities of the wine labourers working on the farms. Simultaneously, he was finding himself feeling increasingly disillusioned by the academy and sensibilities of modern science. He found that the cities he was visiting for his postdoctoral research were repeatedly pointing him away from science and more toward the abundance of Indigenous agriculture and knowledge systems. Following his grandmother's funeral in 2018, Guzha returned to Cape Town, having decided to leave academia and instead do something in food. He had been making ice cream at home for eight years, and charged himself with a mission to turn his skills into a potential business. At first, he experimented with fermented and alcohol-infused ice cream, but then he came across snacks from his home country of  Zimbabwe at a local restaurant and decided to try adding them to ice cream. The snacks included maputi (popped maize), Mazoe orange crush (an orange cordial, sometimes also used in cocktails and fruit punches), baobab (a large pulpy fruit with a citrus-like flavour), small and tangy masau fruit, and nyii, a sweet berry that can be eaten fresh, dried or candied. ""It was the first time I ate ice cream that really connected with who I am. It was nostalgic and made me think of happy times. I connected with it beyond its delicious flavour.""  Guzha officially opened Tapi Tapi as a direct-delivery service in 2018 and has since gone on to ground his continental storytelling through ice cream into a brick-and-mortar cafe. The walls are adorned with Kasvikiro art, a self-taught Afro calligraphy inspired by his keen interest in alphabet systems and handwriting. A reminder also hangs on the entrance wall: ""This is your home, the land of your people. Nourish yourself from it and tend to it so that others may enjoy it too. Remember, our lives, stories and histories don't begin in 1488 [when the first European rounded the southern tip of Africa]. You come from a time and place most ancient. We have been here from the very beginning.""  Since then, Guzha has gone on to collaborate with poets, conservationists, yogis and professors across a range of disciplines to host a range of educational experiences, including tasting menus and foraging hikes. Zandile Finxa, South African chef, consumer scientist, recipe developer and founder of The Sorghum Agenda digital campaign, explained how a visit to Tapi Tapi prompted a series of conversations about their different approaches to food. More like this: • A West African ode to a spicy and tangy chicken dish • The ancient lore of the humble Nigerian yam • Jollof Wars: Who does West Africa's iconic rice dish best? ""I started talking to Guzha about cultural sociology, Indigenous foods and sustainability, and for me, he encompassed all of that,"" they say. For Finxa, engaging with Guzha allowed them to explore the academic side of Indigenous foods and customs drawing on Guzha's scientific background, while also learning from Guzha's cultural exchanges during his travels. Guzha and Finxa's conversations culminated in a collaboration in which Finxa developed a sorghum brownie that Guzha paired with his sorghum blondies ice cream.  Many of the ingredients and ice cream flavours found at Tapi Tapi may not be readily recognisable to people outside Africa. However, this is the idea behind every scoop: to celebrate flavours that are, as Guzha says, ""familiar, nostalgic, local and seasonal, homegrown, common and representative"" of African people without any impositions based on legacies from elsewhere. ""We are not the 'black version of [insert European inspired name here]',"" says Guzha. ""There's a lot of that going around. We don't use 'African sage' in our gelato, we use imphepho. So when you see a name you don't recognise in our flavours, Google it and get to know it for what it is and not for what it approximately represents in your food vocabulary."" For those who cannot get to Tapi Tapi for the ice cream, Guzha offers a range of recipes using ingredients that can be found in the pantries of many African homes, including cookies coated in maize, millet or teff, celebrating grains that would not ordinarily be used to make sweet treats. He serves the cookies with the ice cream.  For Guzha, with a little curiosity and willingness to play and experiment, we can take what have long been simple staples and turn them into delicious desserts. ""There's a lot of magic around us all the time, pay attention and often the land provides. Don't wait on agriculture to feed you when there's bounty abound,"" he says. -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.  For more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.  Copyright 2025 BBC.

6/4/2025,Article,Future,Why China is betting big on salt batteries,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20250530-how-electric-scooters-are-driving-chinas-salt-battery-push,"The country is racing ahead of the rest of the world in bringing sodium-ion batteries to the mass market. This time, through scooters. Dozens of glitzy electric mopeds are lined up outside a shopping mall in the city of Hangzhou in eastern China, drawing passersby to test them. But these Vespa-like scooters, which sell for between £300 and £500 ($400 and $660), are not powered by the mainstream lead-acid or lithium-ion cells, commonly used in electric two-wheelers. Instead, their batteries are made from sodium, an abundant element that can be extracted from sea salt. Next to the scooters stand a few fast-charging pillars, which can replenish the vehicles' power level from 0% to 80% in 15 minutes, according to Yadea, the major Chinese two-wheeler manufacturer holding this promotional event in January 2025 for its newly launched mopeds and charging system. There is also a battery-swapping station, which enables commuters to drop in their spent cells in exchange for fresh ones with a scan of a QR code. (Read more about China's battery swap stations for electric vehicles here.) Yadea is one of many companies in China trying to build a competitive edge in alternative battery technologies, a trend that shows just how fast the country's clean-technology industry is developing. Even as the rest of the world tries to close its gap with China in the race to make cheap, safe and efficient lithium-ion batteries, Chinese companies have already taken a head-start towards mass producing sodium-ion batteries, an alternative that could help the industry reduce its dependence on key raw minerals. Chinese carmakers were the first in the world to launch sodium-powered cars. But the impact of these models – all of them tiny with short ranges – has been low so far. In April 2025, the world's largest battery manufacturer, China's CATL, announced its plan to mass-produce sodium-ion batteries for heavy-duty trucks and cars this year under a new brand Naxtra. China's grid operators have also started to build energy storage stations using sodium-ion batteries to help the grid absorb renewables. This is an area considered by many researchers spoken to by the BBC as the main playground for the emerging technology. Chinese companies' multi-pronged strategy in driving sodium-ion batteries will put it in a leading position of a global race – should there be one, says Cory Combs, who researches critical minerals and supply chains at Beijing-based consultancy Trivium China. He says it remains to be seen whether sodium-ion batteries will really take off. But one segment that is betting big on sodium-ion batteries is the two-wheeler, a fast-growing and highly competitive market in China. Yadea has brought three sodium-powered models to the market so far and is planning to launch more. It has also established the Hangzhou Huayu New Energy Research Institute to research emerging battery chemistries, particularly sodium-ion. ""We want to bring technology from the lab to customers fast,"" Zhou Chao, the company's senior vice president, said in January during a talk show on China Central Television in January. Two-wheelers are an extremely popular mode of transport in many Asian countries, including Vietnam and Indonesia. In China, they are ubiquitous, carrying their owners to shops, offices, metro stations and everywhere in between. Because they are practical and versatile, the Chinese have given them an endearing nickname: ""little electric donkeys"". ""Two-wheeled vehicles typically operate over shorter distances and at lower speeds [than cars], making them less demanding in terms of energy density and power output,"" says Chen Xi, who researches energy storage materials and devices at Xi'an-Jiaotong Liverpool University in China. A sodium-ion battery carries significantly less energy than a lithium-ion battery of the same size, which means it has a lower energy density. For two-wheelers, sodium-ion batteries' main rivals are lead-acid ones, whose energy density and rechargeable cycles are even lower. Their only advantage is that they are cheaper than both sodium and lithium-ion batteries currently, Xi says. The sheer number of two-wheelers in Asia paves a promising pathway to achieving economies of scale. In China alone, around 55 million electric two-wheelers were sold in 2023 – nearly six times the number of all pure, hybrid and fuel-cell electric cars combined sold in the country that year – according to Shanghai-based consultancy iResearch. Scale production was the goal of Yadea. Zhou said at the talk show that the firm was seeking to bring sodium batteries to tens of millions of ordinary commuters by not only fitting them into two-wheelers, but also building a charging ecosystem to enable people to use these models without stress. To test the waters, in 2024 Yadea began a pilot programme with 150,000 food delivery couriers working in Shenzhen, a mega city of 17.8 million people in southern China, reported Shenzhen News. The goal was to enable them to hand in a spent Yadea sodium-ion batteries at its partners' battery-swapping stations in exchange for a fully charged one within 30 seconds, Yadea said. Yadea and other companies, such as battery-swapping firm Dudu Huandian, have grown so rapidly in Shenzhen the city now aims to become a ""battery-swapping city"". It aims to install 20,000 charging or swapping pods for various types of batteries for electric scooters in 2025, and 50,000 by 2027, according to Shenzhen Electric Bicycle Industry Association, a trade body that is working with the Shenzhen government to promote battery swapping. The city – which already has a ""battery-swapping park"" – will build a vast network of battery swapping facilities to enable residents to find a station every five minutes, the trade body says. Sodium-ion and lithium-ion batteries have similar structures. The main difference is the ions they use – the particles shuttling back and forth between a battery's positive and negative sides to store and release energy. Sodium is widely dispersed in the sea and the Earth's crust, making it about 400 times more abundant than lithium. Sodium-ion cells are therefore more accessible and potentially cheaper to produce at scale. They could also free the battery industry from choking points in current supply chains. Lithium ore is currently predominantly mined in Australia, China and Chile, but the processing of the mineral is concentrated in China, which has nearly 60% of the world's lithium-refining capacity. Sodium-ion batteries are not a recent invention. Their fate has been intertwined with that of lithium-ion batteries. The research and development of both cells began about half a century ago, with Japan leading the global effort. But after Japanese electronics company Sony launched the world's first lithium-ion battery in 1991, its huge commercial success led the development of sodium-ion technology to be largely paused – until the beginning of this decade. By then, China had become the dominant battery force worldwide through years of an industrial push by the government. More like this: • Where EV batteries go to die – and be reborn • The batteries made from cement • Renewable energy's trouble with 'wind theft' 2021 proved to be a turning point for sodium-ion batteries. The global prices for battery-grade lithium skyrocketed, multiplying over fourfold in a year due to strong demand for electric vehicles (EV) and the Covid-19 pandemic. Battery and EV manufacturers began to look for alternatives. CATL launched its first-ever sodium-ion battery in July that year, and the move ""triggered high industry interest"", says Phate Zhang, founder of the Shanghai-based EV news outlet CnEVPost. Lithium's prices continued to soar in 2022, driving more cost-conscious Chinese companies towards sodium, he notes. ""The relative abundance of sodium and China's interest in a resilient battery supply chain has been a central factor in driving research and development efforts,"" says Kate Logan, a director at the Asia Society Policy Institute in Washington DC who focuses on China's climate and clean energy policies. Around the time of the mineral's price hike, the country imported roughly 80% of the lithium ore it refined, mainly from Australia and Brazil. But the price of lithium started to plunge in late 2022 and is at a fraction of its peak level today. One reason is that major Chinese battery makers such as CATL and Gotion have expanded their lithium-processing capacity, Zhang says. China has also boosted efforts to find and develop domestic lithium reserves. As a result, the ""frenzy"" around sodium-ion in the last couple of years has ""relaxed"", Combs notes. ""Lithium is pretty squarely back in the leadership role again within China."" For many, though, there are other good reasons to take up sodium-ion batteries. One is safety. In 2024, China was shocked by a wave of battery fires, mostly triggered by the self-combustion of lithium-ion batteries in two-wheelers. Globally, fire risks at energy storage stations have become a concern. In a recent example, a blaze broke out at one such facility inside a major battery plant in California in January 2025. Some industry insiders believe that sodium-ion batteries are safer. They are less prone to overheating and burning compared to lithium-ion ones because sodium's chemical traits are more stable, according to some studies. But others warn that it is still too early to be certain about their safety due to a lack of relevant research. Cold weather also makes a difference. The energy a lithium-ion battery can store and the times it can be recharged drop at sub-zero temperatures. Sodium-ion batteries are less affected by harsh conditions. ""Compared to lithium ions, sodium ions move more easily through the liquid inside the battery. This gives them better conductivity and means they need less energy to break free from the surrounding liquid,"" says Tang Wei, a professor of chemical engineering at China's Xi'an Jiaotong University. Tang and his team have developed a new type of battery liquid they say can enable sodium-ion batteries to achieve more than 80% of their room-temperature capacity at −40C (-40F). They are working with Chinese battery firms to apply the technology onto vehicles and energy storage stations in the country's cold regions. Sodium-ion batteries are also expected to reduce the environmental impact of manufacturing the metals used in lithium-ion cells, particularly cobalt and nickel – heavy metals that can negatively impact humans and nature. A 2024 study concluded that sodium-ion batteries can help the world avoid excessive mining and possible depletion of critical raw materials, but that the production process generates similar volumes of greenhouse gas emissions to lithium-ion cells. As these batteries are still being developed, ""their production processes, lifespans and energy density can all be improved"", says Zhang Shan, the study's lead author and a researcher at Chalmers University of Technology in Gothenburg. ""Their impact on the climate may be lower than that of lithium-ion batteries in the future."" Two of the earliest electric cars powered by sodium batteries rolled off the assembly lines in December 2023. So far, all available models have been ""microcars"", officially classified as A00 in China. But their sales only made up a tiny number of the tens of millions of EVs sold in 2024 in China, says Xing Lei, an independent analyst of the Chinese auto industry (one report found just 204 were sold in 2024). A big downside of sodium-ion batteries is their low energy density: a 2020 study found it is at least 30% lower than their lithium counterparts. This means cars using them typically cannot travel very far on a single charge, Zhang says. ""And range is a big deciding factor for people when they buy an EV."" Sodium-ion batteries have yet to achieve mass production and currently ""cannot compete with lithium-ion batteries on price or performance"" in four-wheelers, making large-scale use in the next two or three years difficult, says Chen Shan, a Shanghai-based analyst on battery markets at Norwegian consultancy Rystad Energy. The uptake of sodium scooters across China has been gradual but encouraging. A spokesperson from Yadea – which sold more than 13 million electric bikes and mopeds globally in 2024 – told the BBC that the sales of its sodium two-wheelers reached nearly 1,000 in the first three months of 2025. The company intends to build around 1,000 fast-charging pillars specifically designed for sodium-ion batteries this year in Hangzhou enabling commuters to find a station every 2km (1.2 miles), Zhou said at the talk show. Yadea is not alone in its sodium push. Another Chinese scooter manufacturer, Tailg, has been selling sodium-powered models since 2023. FinDreams, the battery arm of EV major BYD, is building a plant in east China's Xuzhou to make sodium batteries in partnership with Huaihai Group, a manufacturer of two and three-wheelers, according to local media. Although lead-acid batteries will continue to dominate this industry, the market share of sodium-ion batteries has been projected to grow rapidly over the next five years. By 2030, 15% of China's electric scooters will be powered by them, compared to 0.04% in 2023, according to an analysis by the Shenzhen-based Starting Point Research Institute, which assesses China's battery industry. In fact, a bigger market for sodium-ion batteries may be energy storage stations, which absorb power produced at one time so it can be used later. When they are installed in fixed locations, the disadvantages of using sodium-ion batteries in vehicles disappear. ""You can just make a slightly bigger energy storage plant. It's not moving anywhere. The weight [of the batteries] doesn't matter,"" Combs says. Energy storage is expected to be an enormous and a rapidly growing market as countries across the globe aim to reach their climate goals. The world's grid-scale energy storage capacity will need to grow nearly 35-fold between 2022 and 2030 if it is to achieve net-zero by 2050, according to International Energy Agency (IEA). ""This is going to be a really important market in the future, especially as renewables become more present on the grid. You'll have more need for storage systems to balance out the variability in electricity generation, "" says Ilaria Mazzocco, a senior fellow with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington DC-based non-profit. Using sodium-ion batteries in energy storage stations also means that these facilities are not competing with auto companies for batteries, she notes.  China, which has seen breakneck growth of wind and solar power plants, leads the world in using energy storage to support renewables. In May 2024, it switched on its first energy storage station powered by sodium-ion batteries. Situated in southern China's Guangxi, the plant can hold 10 megawatt-hours of power in one go, equivalent to the daily electricity needs of 1,500 households, according to Chinese state media. It is the first phase of a sodium-ion energy storage station 10 times its size. The Guangxi project was quickly followed by another sodium-ion energy storage site in central China's Hubei province. In fact, roughly one-fifth of the capacity of all energy storage projects planned by China's state-run companies last year used sodium technology, according to Chinese outlet Beijixing, which tracks the power industry. But for sodium-ion batteries to succeed in mass production the main question is whether companies can make them cheaper than lithium-ion cells, according to Zheng Jiayue, a consultant with research and consulting firm Wood Mackenzie who specialises in the energy storage supply chain. Currently, the unit price of sodium-ion batteries for energy storage is about 60% higher than that of lithium-ion ones, but the gap is projected to narrow, China Central Television reported, citing analysis by the China Energy Storage Alliance, a Beijing-based non-profit. Some entrepreneurs and researchers believe that sodium is a shortcut for other countries to reduce their battery dependence on China. But it is Chinese companies that are poised to lead global production if the technology breaks into the mass market. Major Chinese battery makers have included it in their strategies to stay competitive in the long run, says Combs, meaning sodium-ion batteries are no longer a way to bypass their stronghold. The ""biggest difference"" between companies in China and other countries is that the former can bring a technology from the lab to mass production much faster, Zheng says. And because of the similarities between the two types of cells, says Logan, existing manufacturing infrastructure for lithium-ion batteries can be adapted to produce sodium-ion batteries, reducing the time and cost for commercialisation in China. ""The same synergies don't necessarily hold true for other battery chemistries,"" however, she adds.   One example is the all-solid-state batteries, which do not use liquid electrolyte to transport ions, the principle driving the current generation of batteries, says Mo Ke, founder and chief analyst of Beijing-based battery-research firm, RealLi Research. Therefore, it will have less reliance on the current industrial chain, Mo says. A fleet of large factories devoted to making sodium-ion cells are now being built in China, some already in operation. In 2024, Chinese manufacturers announced plans to build 27 sodium-ion battery plants with a combined capacity of 180 GWh, according to Chinese thinktank Gaogong Industrial Research, including BYD's upcoming 30GWh plant in Xuzhou. The planned global sodium-ion battery capacity will exceed 500 GWh by 2033, and China is projected to account for more than 90% of that, Zheng says, citing Wood Mackenzie analysis. Outside China, Natron Energy in the US and Faradion in the UK are forerunners. But it typically takes foreign companies much longer to build production lines and it will be hard for their capacities to compete with China's, Zheng says. In 2023 alone, Chinese firms collectively spent more than 55 billion yuan (£5.7bn, $7.6bn) on the research and development of sodium-ion batteries, according to Alicia García Herrero, an economist and senior fellow at Brussels-based think tank Bruegel. This beats the $4.5bn (£3.4bn, $4.5bn) raised by all US battery start-ups cumulatively by 2023 on non-lithium battery solutions, she says. Chinese companies' incentive is simple, according to Combs: ""Don't lose market share, and future markets are included."" Yadea is already expanding operations in Southeast Asia, Latin America and Africa, where electric scooters are also popular, Zhou said in the talk show. Yadea's goal is clear: to mass-produce sodium-ion batteries and improve scooter charging infrastructure, according to Zhou, ""so as to enable hundreds of millions of people to enjoy green transport"". -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.

6/5/2025,Article,News,Trump and Musk enter bitter feud - and Washington buckles up,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/c3wd2215q08o,"What happens when the richest person and the most powerful politician have a knock-down, drag-out fight? The world may be about to find out. A disagreement between Elon Musk and Donald Trump started at a simmer last week, began bubbling on Wednesday and is now in full-on boil. And like everything these two men do, it is all spilling out into public view. These two men have two of the world's biggest megaphones, and they clearly enjoy using them. In remarks at the Oval Office on Thursday afternoon, Trump sounded a bit like a spurned lover. He expressed surprise at Musk's criticism of his ""big, beautiful"" tax and spending legislation. He pushed back against the notion that he would have lost last year's presidential election without Musk's hundreds of millions of dollars in support. And he said Musk was only changing his tune now because his car company, Tesla, will be hurt by the Republican push to end electric vehicle tax credits. Musk took to his social media site, X, with a very Generation X response for his 220 million followers: ""Whatever"". He said he didn't care about the car subsidies, he wanted to shrink the national debt, which he says is an existential threat to the nation. He called Trump ""ungrateful"" for his help last year and insisted that Democrats would have prevailed without him. Musk and Trump had formed a powerful but unlikely alliance , culminating in the tech billionaire having a key position of budget-slashing authority in the Trump administration. Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, or Doge, became one of the biggest stories of Trump's first 100 days, as it shuttered entire agencies and dismissed thousands of government workers. It wasn't long, however, before speculation began over when – and how - the two outsized personalities would ultimately fall out. For a while, it seemed like those predictions were off the mark. Trump stood by Musk even as the latter's popularity dropped, as he feuded with administration officials and as he became a liability in several key elections earlier this year. Every time it appeared there would be a break, Musk would pop up in the Oval Office, or the Cabinet room or on the president's Air Force One flight to Mar-a-Lago. When Musk's 130 days as a ""special government employee"" ended last week, the two had a chummy Oval Office send-off, with hints that Musk might someday return. It's safe to say that any invitation has been rescinded. ""Elon and I had a great relationship,"" Trump said on Thursday – a comment notable for its use of the past tense. There had been some thought that Trump's surprise announcement on Wednesday night of a new travel ban, additional sanctions on Harvard and a conspiracy-laced administration investigation of former President Joe Biden were all efforts to change the subject from Musk's criticism. The White House and its allies in Congress seemed careful not to further antagonise him after his earlier comments. Then Trump spoke out and … so much for that. Now the question is where the dispute goes next. Congressional Republicans could find it harder to keep their members behind Trump's bill with Musk providing rhetorical – and, perhaps financial – air for those who break ranks.  Trump, who takes pride in being a devastating counterpuncher, will have plenty of opportunity to lay into Musk. What will happen to Musk's Doge allies still in the Trump administration or government contracts to Musk-related companies or Biden-era investigations into Musk's business dealings? ""The easiest way to save money in our budget, billions and billions of dollars, is to terminate Elon's governmental subsidies and contracts,"" Trump posted menacingly on his own social media website. If Trump turns the machinery of government against Musk, the tech billionaire will feel pain. Tesla's stock price slipped on Thursday.  But Musk also has near limitless resources to respond, including by funding insurgent challengers to Republicans in next year's elections and primaries. He may not win a fight against the whole of Trump's government, but he could exact a high political price. Meanwhile, Democrats are on the sidelines, wondering how to respond. Few seem willing to welcome Musk, a former donor to their party, back into the fold. But there's also the old adage that the enemy of an enemy is a friend. ""It's a zero-sum game,"" Liam Kerr, a Democratic strategist, told Politico. ""Anything that he does that moves more toward Democrats hurts Republicans."" At the very least, Democrats seem happy to stand back and let the two men exchange blows. And until they abandon this fight, the din is likely to drown out everything else in American politics. But don't expect this spat to end anytime soon. ""Trump has 3.5 years left as president,"" Musk wrote on X, ""but I will be around for 40-plus years."" Copyright 2025 BBC.

6/5/2025,Article,News,"Trump's new ban dodges pitfalls faced by last attempt, experts say",https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/cd7gp8l1241o,"US President Donald Trump has issued a sweeping new travel ban for people from 12 countries, revisiting a hallmark policy of his first term in office. There are some key differences, however. The original travel ban suffered a series of legal defeats. This time, the policy appears to have been designed to avoid the same pitfalls. Its predecessor, which targeted seven predominantly Muslim countries and was dubbed the ""Muslim ban"" by critics, was ordered just a week after Trump took office in 2017, during his first term in the White House. The ban was amended twice to overcome court challenges, after opponents argued it was unconstitutional and illegal because it discriminated against travellers based on their religion. A scaled-back version was eventually upheld by the US Supreme Court in 2018, which this new ban closely resembles. Legal experts told the BBC that it appeared Trump had learned lessons from his first attempt. Christi Jackson, an expert in US immigration law at the London firm Laura Devine Immigration, said the new ban was more legally robust as a result. While the first lacked ""clarity"", the new restrictions were ""wider in scope"" and had ""clearly defined"" exemptions, she said. While there are some similarities in the nations chosen by the 2017 ban and the 2025 ban, Muslim-majority states are not the express target of the latest order. Barbara McQuade, professor of law at the University of Michigan and former US attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan, told the BBC World Service's Newshour programme that, on this basis, it seemed likely to win the approval of the Supreme Court if it was ever referred up to that level. The 12 countries subject to the harshest restrictions from 9 June are mainly in the Middle East, Africa and the Caribbean, including Afghanistan, Iran and Somalia. There will be partial restrictions on travellers from another seven countries, including Cuban and Venezuelan nationals. Trump said the strength of the restrictions would be graded against the severity of the perceived threat, including from terrorism. But besides Iran, none of the 12 countries hit by the outright ban are named on the US government's state sponsors of terrorism list. Trump cited Sunday's incident in Boulder, Colorado, in which a man was accused of throwing Molotov cocktails at demonstrators attending a march for Israeli hostages, in a video announcing the ban on X. The alleged attacker was an Egyptian national. However, Egypt does not appear on either list.  Trump also specified high rates of people overstaying their visas as a reason for listing certain countries. However, Steven D Heller, an immigration lawyer based in the US, said there was a ""lack of clarity"" over what threshold had to be met by a country's overstaying rate in order for that country to be placed on Trump's ban list. That could be the basis for a successful legal challenge, he suggested. ""If they're relying on this notion of excessive overstay rates... they have to define what that actually means,"" he told the BBC. But he noted that existing US law gave the president broad powers over immigration policy. Unlike the first ban, which was to last for only 90 to 120 days, today's order has no end date. It has been met with dismay in the targeted countries.  Venezuela has described the Trump administration as ""supremacists who think they own the world"", though Somalia has pledged to ""engage in dialogue to address the concerns raised"". The original ban spurred mass protests and sowed chaos at US airports.  It was repealed in 2021 by Trump's successor, President Joe Biden, who called the policy ""a stain on our national conscience"". Immigration lawyer Shabnam Lotfi, who challenged the previous travel ban, said it would be an ""uphill battle"" to overturn the new one.  ""The president does have the authority to determine who is admissible to the US,"" she said, adding that because of the way the ban had been written, it was ""harder to find a huge group of people that could file a class-action lawsuit"". ""They've put more thought into it."" Ms Lotfi noted that the new restrictions could have consequences for students and other visa applicants abroad. ""Students who are stuck in administrative processing are impacted. So are winners of the diversity visa lottery who paid fees and went to interviews - they're unlikely to get visas now,"" she said. ""Even EB-5 investors - people who've put over $1 million into the US economy - are affected. And H-1B visa holders stuck abroad, waiting to return to their US employers, could also be blocked.""

6/5/2025,Article,News,Israeli military recovers two hostages' bodies in southern Gaza,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/c989rl23zzno,"Israeli forces have recovered the bodies of two Israeli-Americans taken back to Gaza as hostages during the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, the Israeli military says. Judi Weinstein Haggai, 70, who was also a Canadian citizen, and her husband Gadi Haggai, 72, were murdered by gunmen from the Mujahideen Brigades group when they attacked Kibbutz Nir Oz, a statement said. Their bodies were found in the southern Khan Younis area of Gaza overnight and brought back to Israel for forensic identification. There are now 56 hostages still being held by Hamas in Gaza, at least 20 of whom are believed to be alive. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he and his wife sent their condolences to the families of Judi and Gadi Haggai. ""Our hearts grieve over this terrible loss. May their memories be blessed,"" he added. ""I would like to thank, and express appreciation to, the fighters and commanders for this determined and successful operation. We will not rest, nor will we be silent, until we return home all of our hostages - the living and the deceased."" The couple's families recalled how they ""went out for a walk on the morning of that cursed Saturday and never returned"". ""We welcome the closure and their return to a proper burial at home, in Israel,"" they said. Judi, an English teacher, and Gadi Haggai, who used to work in Kibbutz Nir Oz's kitchen, were last seen alive in a video they shared with a group chat at the start of the 7 October attack. They were seen taking cover in a field as incoming rockets fired from Gaza streaked overhead and the sound of gunfire was heard. Judi later told friends and relatives they had been wounded, before ceasing contact. The couple's daughter Iris Weinstein Haggai said after the attack her mother had told her they had been ""shot by terrorists on a motorcycle and that my dad was wounded really bad"". She added: ""Paramedics tried to send her an ambulance. The ambulance got hit by a rocket."" In December 2023, the kibbutz announced that both Judi and Gadi were killed that day and their bodies were being held hostage in Gaza. On Wednesday, an Israeli military official said the couple's bodies were recovered from the Khan Younis area following an operation based on ""precise intelligence"" from the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and the Shin Bet security service. They said they could not disclose further details due to the sensitivity of the operation. However, Israeli Army Radio reported the intelligence was obtained through the Shin Bet's interrogation of a Palestinian fighter captured by Israeli troops in Gaza. ""We will keep doing the utmost for the mission of bringing our hostages back - the living, to reunite with their families, and the deceased to dignified burial. We will deploy all the methods and tools in our disposal for this goal,"" the military official said. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum urged decision-makers to do everything they could to agree a new ceasefire deal with Hamas to secure the return of all the remaining hostages. ""There is no need to wait another 608 agonising days for this,"" it said. ""The mission can be completed as early as tomorrow morning. This is what the majority of the Israeli people want."" US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said he was ""united in prayer"" for the Haggai family. ""Hamas must release all remaining hostages, including Omer Neutra and Itay Chen,"" he added, referring to two other Israeli-Americans who the Israeli military says were killed on 7 October while serving as soldiers and whose bodies were taken back to Gaza. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said: ""The return of their remains is a time to begin to heal and to rest. We mourn with [Judi Haggai's] family. May her memory be a blessing."" Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza in response to the unprecedented cross-border attack almost 20 months ago, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. Another four people, two of them dead, were already being held captive in Gaza before the conflict. So far, 199 hostages have been returned, 148 of them alive, mostly through two temporary ceasefire deals with Hamas. At least 54,677 people have been killed in Gaza during the war, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Israel imposed a total blockade on Gaza on 2 March and resumed its military offensive against Hamas two weeks later, collapsing a two-month truce during which 33 Israeli hostages and five Thai hostages were freed. Israel said it wanted to put pressure on Hamas to release the remaining hostages. On 19 May, the Israeli military launched an expanded offensive that Netanyahu said would see troops ""take control of all areas"" of Gaza. Israel also partially eased its blockade, allowing some food into the territory amid warnings from experts of a looming famine. More than 4,400 people have reportedly been killed in Gaza over the past three months, while 640,000 others have been displaced again by Israeli ground operations and evacuation orders. Hopes of a new ceasefire deal faded last week, with Hamas and Israel remaining at odds over the conditions of the latest US proposal. Hamas said it was prepared to release 10 living hostages and the bodies of 18 dead ones, which was the number specified in US envoy Steve Witkoff's proposal, in exchange for a 60-day truce and the release of Palestinian prisoners. But the group also repeated its demands for guarantees that the truce would lead to a permanent ceasefire, as well as a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, and the resumption of unrestricted aid deliveries. Israel called Hamas's statement a refusal of the proposal, and Witkoff said it was totally unacceptable. But a Hamas official insisted it had acted positively and responsibly. Copyright 2025 BBC.

6/5/2025,Article,Sport,Sabalenka takes out Swiatek to reach French Open final,https://www.bbc.com//sport/tennis/articles/c93yxvwp1lvo,"Aryna Sabalenka has reached five of the past seven Grand Slam finals French Open 2025 Dates: 25 May-8 June Venue: Roland Garros Coverage: Live radio commentaries across 5 Live Sport and BBC Sounds, plus live text commentaries on the BBC Sport website and app World number one Aryna Sabalenka moved a step closer to a maiden French Open title by taking out four-time champion Iga Swiatek in a blockbuster semi-final. Sabalenka will meet second seed Coco Gauff in Saturday's showpiece after the American ruthlessly ended French wildcard Lois Boisson's incredible run. Belarus' Sabalenka earned a 7-6 (7-1) 4-6 6-0 victory to end fifth seed Swiatek's 26-match winning run at the tournament. After a slow start on the Roland Garros clay, Poland's Swiatek fought back to level but Sabalenka dominated a 22-minute deciding set. Sabalenka, whose three Grand Slam titles have all come on hard courts, has never reached the Paris final before. ""It feels incredible but the job is not done yet. I'm thrilled with my performance,"" the 27-year-old said. ""Iga is the toughest opponent, especially at Roland Garros, I'm proud I managed to get this win."" Gauff, runner-up to Swiatek in 2022, won 6-1 6-2 against world number 361 Boisson, who was appearing in her first Grand Slam main draw. This was the potential match that everyone had their eye on when the French Open draw was made: the 'Queen of Clay' against the world number one in the crunch stages. Swiatek and Sabalenka have claimed six of the past 10 majors between them and dominated the WTA Tour over the past three years. But with Swiatek dropping to fifth in the world after a turbulent season, it was Sabalenka who came into Roland Garros as the favourite. The magnitude of the eagerly-anticipated encounter appeared to affect both players in an edgy opening set. With the roof closed because of the wet weather in Paris, Sabalenka initially settled quicker in the heavier conditions that suit her game. The pace of Sabalenka's returning was too hot for Swiatek and allowed the top seed to quickly move a double break ahead. Swiatek took a step back in her baseline position to better absorb the pace and, after being a point away from going 5-1 behind, battled back. Iga Swiatek saw her serve broken eight times during the match The tweak helped a sharper Swiatek elongate the rallies and put more pressure on Sabalenka's serve, with the Pole winning the next three games to move 5-4 ahead. With both players looking tight, momentum continued to fluctuate. Swiatek's serve buckled, Sabalenka could not serve out the set at 6-5 and a nervy encounter was ultimately decided on a tie-break dominated by the Belarusian. Three successive breaks - down to quality returning as much as poor serving - began the second set before Swiatek settled down to maintain the advantage and force a decider. However, Swiatek's serve suddenly dropped off again and allowed Sabalenka to quickly reach her fifth final in the past seven Grand Slam tournaments. ""I think I lost my intensity a bit,"" said Swiatek. ""She played as strong as in the first set, but I didn't react to that well and just couldn't push back."" For the first time since 2011, fans had a home player to cheer in the women's semi-finals - and nobody could have guessed it would be Boisson. The 22-year-old's journey from an unknown player returning from serious injury to a Grand Slam semi-finalist competing with the world's best is extraordinary. Boisson was set to be a wildcard entry last year but had to pull out after tearing an anterior cruciate ligament just a week before the French Open began. But 12 months on, she returned to make a remarkable run that will never be forgotten by French fans. Taking the scalps of third seed Jessica Pegula and sixth seed Mirra Andreeva put her into a first career semi-final on the biggest stage of all. However, Gauff proved to be a step too far. Despite having the backing of a raucous crowd on Court Philippe Chatrier, the energy provided was not enough to compensate for Boisson's lack of quality. Gauff dominated the rallies, breaking Boisson's serve six times before wrapping up victory in one hour and nine minutes. Copyright Â© 2025 BBC.

6/5/2025,Article,News,What we know about Trump's latest travel ban,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/cx271g270v7o,"Donald Trump has signed a ban on travel to the US from 12 countries, citing national security risks. There are also seven additional countries whose nationals will face partial travel restrictions. The US president said the list could be revised if ""material improvements"" were made, while other countries could be added as ""threats emerge around the world"".  It is the second time he has ordered a ban on travel from certain countries. He signed a similar order in 2017 during his first term in office. Trump has signed a proclamation banning travel to the US from nationals of 12 countries: Nationals from these countries will not be allowed to enter the US unless they qualify for an exemption.  There are an additional seven countries whose nationals face partial travel restrictions:  Those under the partial restrictions will not be able to travel to the US with certain visas. The ban takes effect on Monday at 00:01 EDT (04:01 GMT), a cushion that avoids the chaos that unfolded at US airports when a similar measure took effect with virtually no notice eight years ago.  No end date has been provided. The order calls for periodic review. The White House said these ""common sense restrictions"" would ""protect Americans from dangerous foreign actors"". In a video posted to his Truth Social website, Trump said the recent alleged terror attack in Boulder, Colorado ""underscored the extreme dangers"" posed by foreign nationals who had not been ""properly vetted"". Twelve people were injured in Colorado on Sunday when a man attacked a group gathering in support of Israeli hostages, throwing two incendiary devices and using a makeshift flamethrower. The man accused of carrying out the attack has been identified as an Egyptian national, but Egypt is not included on the list of banned countries. Trump has close ties with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who has in the past been described by the US president as his ""favourite dictator"". Only two of the 19 countries are on the US government's State Sponsors of Terrorism list - Iran, which has a full ban, and Cuba, which faces partial travel restrictions. But national security is given as a partial reason for the choices. In the proclamation, Trump said many of the countries listed have a ""historic failure to accept back their removable nationals"" from the US, as well as having ""taken advantage"" of the US by exploiting its visa system. He added that nationals from certain countries also ""pose significant risks"" of overstaying their visas. There are a number of people from affected countries who may still be able to enter the US due to a number of exceptions. The order does not apply to:  In addition, the US Secretary of State may grant exemptions to individuals on a ""case-by-case"" basis, if ""the individual would serve a United States national interest"". Trump's latest order, which is expected to face legal challenges, drew a swift response, at home and abroad.  Chad has retaliated by suspending all visas to US citizens, with President Mahamat Idriss Déby Itno saying the country ""has its dignity and pride"". Somalia promised to work with the US to address any security issues, with ambassador to the US, Dahir Hassan Abdi, saying his country ""values its longstanding relationship"" with the US.  Venezuela's Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello warned that ""being in the United States is a great risk for anyone, not just for Venezuelans"". The African Union, which represents all 55 countries on the continent, called on the US to ""engage in constructive dialogue with the countries concerned"".   It appealed to the US to exercise its right to protect its borders and its citizens' security ""in a manner that is balanced, evidence-based, and reflective of the long-standing partnership between the United States and Africa"". The union said it remained concerned about the ""potential negative impact of such measures"". The UN's human rights chief, Volker Turk, said the ban ""raises concerns from the perspective of international law"" ""The broad and sweeping nature of the new travel ban raises concerns from the perspective of international law,"" Volker Turk said in a statement. That included ""the principle of non-discrimination and of the necessity and proportionality of the measures deployed to meet the security concerns stated"", he told news agency AFP. In the US, Democrats were quick to condemn the move. ""This ban, expanded from Trump's Muslim ban in his first term, will only further isolate us on the world stage,"" Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal wrote on social media. Congressman Don Beyer said Trump had ""betrayed"" the ideals of the founders of the US. Human rights organisation Amnesty International USA described it as ""discriminatory, racist, and downright cruel"", while the US-based Human Rights First called it ""yet another anti-immigrant and punitive action taken"" by the president. But others support the ban. Congressman Clay Higgins of Louisiana said travel to the US was ""a privilege, not a right"".  He claimed on BBC Radio's Today programme that Americans had ""had enough of immigrants coming to our country, violating our laws and committing violence among our people"". Greg Swenson, chairman of Republicans Overseas UK, said the list of countries subject to the travel ban proves the White House is using a ""common sense policy"", but expressed suprise that Egypt had not been included. ""I think what the president has decided was that Egypt, despite having one particular incident from an illegal migrant, might have some policies that are in place which are better than other countries,"" he said. Trump's original ban took place in 2017, during his first White House term, and featured some of the same countries as his latest order, including Iran, Libya and Somalia.   Critics called it a ""Muslim ban"" as the seven countries initially listed were Muslim majority, and it was immediately challenged in courts across the US. The White House revised the policy, ultimately adding two non-Muslim majority countries, North Korea and Venezuela. It was upheld by the US Supreme Court in 2018. Joe Biden, who succeeded Trump as US president, repealed the ban in 2021, calling it ""a stain on our national conscience"". US immigration law expert Christi Jackson said the new ban suggested ""lessons have been learned"" from Trump's first attempt. The latest ban was not being implemented immediately, the restrictions were ""wider in scope"" and it had ""clearly defined"" exemptions, she told the BBC. Professor of law and former US attorney Barbara McQuade said the last travel ban had ""caused chaos at the border"", while this time Trump had given some advance notice. ""The first time around it included lawful permanent residents or Green Card holders, people who had established status in the United States, which courts found to be a violation of the Constitution,"" she told BBC Newshour. ""This time I think there has been more thought given to this,"" she said, adding it was ""very likely"" to be upheld by the Supreme Court.

6/5/2025,Article,News,Three journalists among five killed in Israeli strike on Gaza hospital,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/ckgnp154eeko,"Five people have been killed in an Israeli strike on al-Ahli hospital in Gaza City, according to the Anglican Church, which operates it. The Episcopal Diocese of Jerusalem said three journalists, a father escorting his son to surgery, and another person died on Thursday morning when the hospital's compound was hit. It condemned ""in the strongest possible terms"" the attack, which also injured 30 bystanders, including four hospital staff. The Palestinian Journalists' Syndicate accused Israel of a ""full-fledged war crime"". The Israeli military said it ""precisely struck"" a Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) fighter operating from a command centre inside the hospital's yard. It came the same day as more than 130 global news and press freedom organisations - including the BBC - called for international media to be given immediate access to Gaza and for Palestinian journalists to be given full protection. ""For 20 months, the Israeli authorities have refused to grant journalists outside of Gaza independent access to the Palestinian territory - a situation that is without precedent in modern warfare,"" they wrote in a letter co-ordinated by the Committee to Protect Journalists and Reporters Without Borders. ""Local journalists, those best positioned to tell the truth, face displacement and starvation. To date, nearly 200 journalists have been killed by the Israeli military.  ""Many more have been injured and face constant threats to their lives for doing their jobs: bearing witness. This is a direct attack on press freedom and the right to information."" There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military or government. They have previously denied that Israeli forces have targeted journalists. The Palestinian Journalists' Syndicate said the Israeli strike on al-Ahli hospital's compound directly targeted a media tent. Video footage showed medics and other people rushing to help casualties lying on the ground underneath a tree in a yard and carrying at least four of them into a medical tent. ""The Israeli drone suddenly attacked these colleagues,"" Palestinian journalist Mohammed Ahmed told the news agency Reuters at the scene. ""Three of them [were] martyred, in addition to a number of martyrs among passersby."" ""The Israeli occupation forces are increasing their attacks on us as journalists, trying to prevent us from doing our work,"" he alleged. The journalists' syndicate identified the three dead journalists as Ismail Badah, a cameraman for the PIJ-affiliated Palestine Today TV channel, Soliman Hajaj, a Palestine Today editor, and Samir al-Refai of the Shams News network. Another four journalists were injured, two of whom - Palestine Today correspondent Imad Daloul and Ahmed Qalja, a cameraman for Qatar-based Al-Araby TV - were in a critical condition, it said. The Israeli military said in a statement that it ""precisely struck an Islamic Jihad terrorist who was operating in a command-and-control centre"" in the yard of the hospital. It did not name the target or provide any evidence. The military also accused armed groups of using al-Ahli for ""terrorist activity"" and ""cynically and brutally using the civilian population"" inside - an allegation it has denied. In April, staff at al-Ahli hospital said an Israeli strike destroyed its laboratory and damaged its emergency room. They did not report any direct casualties, but said a child died due to disruption of care. The Israeli military said it hit a Hamas ""command-and-control centre"". Hospitals are specially protected under international humanitarian law. They only lose that protection in certain circumstances, including being used as a base from which to launch an attack, as a weapons depot, or to hide healthy fighters. The Hamas-run Civil Defence agency said Israeli strikes killed at least 37 people across Gaza on Thursday. As well as Gaza City, local media reported deaths in Jabalia and Beit Lahia in the north, and in Khan Younis in the south. Also on Thursday, a controversial US and Israeli-backed aid group working in Gaza said it had reopened two of its distribution centres, a day after closing them for ""renovation"". ""Over the past 24 hours, we have been fully focused on strengthening our distribution sites to ensure safe and more efficient delivery of life-saving aid to the people of Gaza,"" the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation's (GHF) interim executive director John Acree said in a statement. On Wednesday, the GHF announced that it was shutting all of its sites - three out of four of which had been operational - to make them ""as safe as possible"" following a string of deadly incidents nearby. Dozens of Palestinians have been killed in recent days while approaching one of the centres in Rafah on a route that runs through an Israeli military zone. Witnesses have said Israeli forces opened fire at crowds seeking aid. The Israeli military has denied that it fired at civilians within the centre, but it has said that troops fired at ""suspects"" who ignored warning shots and approached them. The GHF has denied that anyone was killed or injured at its centres. The group, which uses US private security contractors, aims to bypass the UN as the main supplier of aid to Palestinians. The UN and other aid groups refuse to co-operate with the new system, saying it contravenes the humanitarian principles of neutrality, impartiality, and independence. They also warn that Gaza's 2.1 million population faces catastrophic levels of hunger after an almost three-month total Israeli blockade that was partially eased two weeks ago. The US and Israel say the GHF's system will prevent aid being stolen by Hamas, which the group denies doing. Separately, the Israeli military said it recovered the bodies of two Israeli-Americans taken back to Gaza as hostages during the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023. Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza in response to the attack, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. At least 54,677 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Copyright 2025 BBC.

6/5/2025,Article,Sport,'There is no crisis' before Euro 2025 - Wiegman,https://www.bbc.com//sport/football/articles/cp92pjg020yo,"This video can not be played 'I'm really happy where we are right now' England manager Sarina Wiegman says ""there is no crisis"" despite a chaotic 10 days which has seen three high-profile senior players either retire from international football in the build-up to Euro 2025 or withdraw from the tournament. Wiegman named a 23-player squad on Thursday for the tournament in Switzerland, which starts on 2 July, where England are defending champions. She will be without goalkeeper Mary Earps and midfielder Fran Kirby, who have both retired from international football, while defender Millie Bright, who captained the side to the World Cup final in 2023, withdrew from selection to focus on her mental and physical wellbeing. The loss of three players, who have won a combined 217 caps, in such a short time has led to a potentially unsettling period for the Lionesses - and distractions off the pitch dominated discussions at the end of their Women's Nations League campaign this week. ""Yeah, of course, [it] has been hard,"" said Wiegman. ""I think there are three different stories and every story is one on its own.  ""[These are] players who have been with us for a long time, who I have been working with for a long time and so that's hard."" But the Dutchwoman says she is happy with the atmosphere inside the England camp. ""You [the media] see part of it, you are not in our environment all the time and I can ensure that the training sessions were really good last week,"" she said. ""I didn't see anything [to suggest] that there were no connections within the team. I am really happy [with] where we are right now."" Wiegman had to address issues around player's performance-related bonuses in the build-up to the World Cup and there was also heavy scrutiny on her decision to omit former captain Steph Houghton from the Euro 2022 squad in her first year in charge.  ""My experiences before is that there is always noise. We expect noise until we go into the tournament,"" said Wiegman.  ""The difference is, between 2015 and 2017 to now, is that the attention and visibility of the women's game has increased so much. ""It seems like there is more noise but there's just more journalists here. Which is right. It shows what we are doing. We have to deal with it and move on. Which we have."" Sarina Wiegman is aiming to win a third successive Euros title as manager Wiegman said she was feeling ""good"" despite it being a week full of difficult decisions and conversations. Kirby's retirement followed Wiegman's decision not to include her in the Euros squad, while goalkeeper Earps was unhappy at her position as number two.  Wiegman said it is ""part of the job"" to endure those experiences but she can ""move forward"" to the Euros now. ""Yes, those hard conversations are not nice. I know what players do and how hard they work to make the squad. It's hard to give disappointing messages,"" she added.  ""At the same time, I also had very nice messages to give so that gives me more energy. ""After I have conversations with players, I always think, 'OK, what went well?' For me, it is really important that I am honest, that I treat people in the right way. ""Sometimes, you have very good news and, sometimes, you don't have good news - and I don't go around the bush with that.  ""I just give that message, then I can't always control how people respond to that. I just hope that they have the clarity to move on."" Wiegman also said part of the growth of women's football, and the success of the Lionesses, has added increased demands on her players. Bright's withdrawal has been a blow for England as Wiegman said the Chelsea captain would have been selected had she not ruled herself out. Asked when she was made aware of Bright's decision, she said: ""In the last couple of days I found out. It was sad and disappointing.  ""It's not nice when you don't feel well physically and mentally and I just hope she feels better soon.  ""England's profile is growing. That's life changing and very exciting but at the same time players are not robots. They have to deal with these things too.  ""That's also why we're trying to support them as well as possible on and off the pitch. Hopefully many players stay fit and healthy."" Head here to get involved Copyright Â© 2025 BBC.

6/5/2025,Article,News,US-Boeing deal over crashes 'repugnant' - lawyer for victims' families,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/c5y57p8xnp5o,"A lawyer for 16 families of the victims of a fatal Boeing 737 Max crash, has told the BBC that a deal between the aviation giant and the US Justice Department (DOJ) is ""morally repugnant"". The firm said it agreed to pay $1.1bn (£811.5m) to avoid prosecution over two crashes that killed 346 people, in a filing on Wednesday. Sanjiv Singh, counsel for family members of some of the victims of a 2018 crash in Indonesia, says the deal allows the firm to ""sidestep true criminal accountability"". Boeing has previously said: ""We are deeply sorry for their losses, and remain committed to honouring their loved ones' memories by pressing forward with the broad and deep changes to our company"". The deal includes the company paying $444.5m to families of crash victims. It will also put $455m towards improving its compliance, safety and quality programmes. Under the deal, Boeing also agreed to pay a criminal penalty of $487.2m, although half of that was already paid in 2021. ""Boeing is committed to complying with its obligations under this resolution, which include a substantial additional fine and commitments to further institutional improvements and investments,"" said a company spokesperson.  If the deal is approved by a federal judge the plane maker will avoid a criminal fraud trial. ""The [DOJ] agreed that it will not further criminally prosecute the company"", said Boeing in a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing. The BBC has contacted the DOJ to request further comment on the agreement. Two 737 Max aircraft crashed in separate but almost identical accidents that killed 346 people. In October 2018, all 189 people on a Lion Air flight died after the aircraft crashed into the Java Sea 13 minutes after take-off from Jakarta, Indonesia. In March 2019, an Ethiopian Airlines flight crashed six minutes after take-off from the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa. All 157 people on-board were killed. Both crashes were linked to faulty flight control systems. In 2021, Boeing agreed to settle US fraud charges and admitted deception over hiding information from safety officials about the design of its 737 Max planes. Relatives of the victims will have the chance to appeal this latest deal when it is considered by a federal judge. Mr Singh says the latest agreement has provoked ""visceral outrage"" from his clients and believes the current payout is insufficient. ""If you look at that $1.1bn, it's actually like Boeing paying $10 to escape criminal liability. It's as if they got a misdemeanour ticket or a parking ticket."" Copyright 2025 BBC.

6/5/2025,Article,News,Medicines watchdog to open 'digital hub' in city,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/ce8148d4k5jo,"The UK's drug safety watchdog is to open a new ""digital hub"" in West Yorkshire.  The site, to be located in Leeds city centre, would focus on digital delivery, software development and data science, according to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). The MHRA regulates new medicines, healthcare products and healthcare technologies for patients to use. Lawrence Tallon, MHRA chief executive, said opening the new site in the city was aimed at ""strengthening our ability to collaborate with partners across the north of England"". There had been a ""huge growth"" in healthcare technologies driven by changes in software and AI which were going to revolutionise the way the NHS worked, and the new Leeds hub would help regulate those technologies, Mr Tallon said. Leeds was chosen for the new hub as it was home to over 44,000  tech professionals and about 11,000 students studying tech-related subjects, according to the MHRA. The hub, in Wellington Place, would also serve as a base for the digital operations of NHS England, with increasing investment from major tech companies, an MHRA spokesperson said. About 30 permanent, highly-skilled roles would initially be recruited to work at the new centre in the city, they added. Wes Streeting, secretary of state for health and social care, said: ""There is a global tech revolution in healthcare unfolding, and Yorkshire will help our country lead it.  ""This isn't just about creating new jobs across the region, it's also about bolstering a city that's already leading the way in digital health."" Mr Tallon said that by establishing an MHRA digital hub in Leeds, ""we're strengthening our ability to collaborate with partners across the north of England – bringing regulatory expertise closer to the people, organisations and innovations we serve"". Meanwhile, he said Leeds was ""buzzing, thriving, an exciting place"". ""We are really excited about create new jobs within our organisation right in the heart of Leeds,"" Mr Tallon added. Fiona Venner, Leeds City Council's executive member for equality, health and wellbeing, said the MHRA's announcement of the plan for a digital hub was ""welcome"". ""Leeds is already a centre for digital health and innovation and this rapidly growing market contributes significantly to the economy,"" she said. ""The hub will support the creation of jobs and provide career opportunities for local graduates and professionals.""

6/5/2025,Article,News,Women warned weight-loss jabs may affect the pill,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/cn0gp2pl7zwo,"Women using weight-loss jabs have been warned by the UK's medicines regulator that they must use effective contraception. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) says it is not known whether taking the medicines, such as Wegovy and Mounjaro, could harm an unborn baby. It also warns that weight-loss jabs may make the contraceptive pill less likely to work in those who are overweight or obese. There are concerns that the growing popularity of 'skinny jabs' means many women aren't using the drugs safely or getting the right advice. It's thought the contraceptive pill may not be absorbed properly due to common side-effects of the jabs such as vomiting and diarrhoea, and because they slow the emptying of the stomach.  The MHRA says women should use contraception while taking GLP-1 medicines and for a certain period afterwards before trying to become pregnant - two months for Wegovy and Ozempic, and one month for Mounjaro. It also advises that those using Mounjaro and taking an oral contraceptive should also use a condom for four weeks after starting the drug, or switch to another method such as the coil or implant.  Advice on contraception already appears in patient information leaflets that come with the medicines, but the MHRA has now issued its own guidance. The drugs safety body says weight-loss injections must not be taken: Women should be told this information when they starting taking the jabs, but there are fears the message is not getting through. Natasha Major, 26, started using Mounjaro to lose weight before planning to try for her third baby in a few years' time, but was shocked six weeks later to find she was pregnant. She was taking the contraceptive pill at the time. ""I have polycystic ovaries as well, so I can't get pregnant easily or quickly. So it was an even bigger shock that I had, which didn't make any sense to me,"" she says. She then worried she could be harming the baby or it would not develop properly. Natasha rang her GP for advice and was told to stop taking it. ""We're over the initial shock now and really happy, just wasn't expected,"" she says.  ""The last injection I took, I found out about the pregnancy three hours later and haven't taken it since then. ""I've had an early scan to make sure the pregnancy was viable and okay - baby had a little heartbeat and everything looks good,"" Natasha says.  The MHRA, as well as doctors and pharmacists, are worried that popular GLP-1 medicines, known as Wegovy, Mounjaro, Saxenda, Victoza and Ozempic, are not being used safely. These prescription medicines, which are licensed to treat obesity (and Ozempic for type 2 diabetes), make people feel full by mimicking a hormone released after eating. Mounjaro also acts on another hormone linked to appetite and blood sugar control. They are only available on the NHS to people with a very high BMI, but can also be bought privately from high street and online chemists. Such is the demand for the jabs, they are also being sold illegally on social media and from beauty salons, without any medical advice or prescription, as a quick fix to lose weight.  The MHRA advises people to have a conversation with their prescriber about the risks and benefits of taking them, and understand the potential side-effects by talking to a doctor or pharmacist. It has acted now because it has received around 40 reports relating to pregnancy made to its Yellow Card scheme, where the public can report suspected side-effects of medicines. Some of these have been unintended pregnancies. Dr Alison Cave, chief safety officer at the MHRA, said there was evidence from animal studies ""that these medicines may harm the unborn baby"". ""But we don't know whether we have the same effects in humans, so much more data is needed to determine that."" Women of child-bearing age are usually not included in clinical trials, which is why there is a lack of safety information for them. ""If you are taking this medicine and you are pregnant, you should talk to your doctor about stopping the medicine as soon as possible,"" Dr Cave said. Sukhi Basra, vice-chairwoman of the National Pharmacy Association, said women should visit their pharmacist for advice if they are confused about when to stop using the drugs, and always buy them from an official pharmacy. Dr Bassel Wattar, pregnancy expert and consultant at Epsom and St Helier University Hospitals, said the implant or the intrauterine coil offered ""more robust contraception"" than the oral combined contraceptive pill while taking the injections. Losing a lot of weight can sometimes help some women restore natural ovulation and boost their chances of becoming pregnant, but he said this should be planned under the care of specialist doctors ""to ensure a pregnancy can be planned safely after a washout period off these drugs"". BPAS, the British Pregnancy Advisory Service, says women in the UK ""face significant challenges"" when trying to access their contraceptive method of choice. A lack of appointments, long waiting lists and high costs are just some of the barriers they face, BPAS said, as it called for a better plan for providing the choice women need.

6/5/2025,Article,News,"Charli XCX, Snow Patrol and Stereophonics among Belsonic headline acts",https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/cd7gp2je5ewo,"More than 100,000 music lovers are expected to gather at Belfast's Ormeau Park in the next few weeks for Belsonic.  The annual outdoor music festival kicks off on Thursday night and runs until the end of the month.  The first headliners are Welsh band Stereophonics.  ""Hopefully it doesn't rain. We'll be all right.... we've got our raincoats,"" lead singer Kelly Jones told BBC Radio Ulster's Vinny & Cate show. Jones said a recent world tour proves they are not a band that relies on ""being a phase"" from the 1990s and that their music ""is still appealing to new audiences"".  ""There are kids in the front row,"" he added.   Snow Patrol, Alanis Morissette, Charli XCX, the DJ BLK and Justin Timberlake are among a host of other big names set to take to the stage this year. Lush! Classical, featuring the Ulster Orchestra, are headlining on Saturday while Catfish and the Bottlemen are performing the following Saturday (15 June).  Justin Timberlake will perform on 26 June, supported by Jess Glynne. For dance music fans, the Boiler Room will see Dutch DJ and producer Chris Stussy team up with KETTAMA, a DJ and producer from Galway, on 28 June.  Alanis Morissette will wrap up the festival on 30 June.  Festival director Alan Simms said when deciding on the acts they aim for ""a broad range of music that appeals to as broad a range of people as possible"".  He said personally he was looking forward to seeing Snow Patrol as they had been trying to get them for many years but for ""diaries and for other reasons it hasn't panned out"" in the past.   The gates at Ormeau Park will open at 18:00 BST and close at 21:45 BST. Belsonic says the curfew is usually about 23:00 BST but times will be posted on social media on the day of the event. Translink says while there will be no special shuttle buses in Belfast for the gigs, scheduled Metro bus services connect with Ormeau Park. If you are travelling from the north west, special Goldliner coach services are operating from and to Foyle Street Buscentre in Londonderry for all of the events, with the exception of the Madness concert.  There will also be additional rail services running throughout Belsonic. Further information is available here.  Ormeau Embankment is set to be closed from Ravenhill Road to Ormeau Road from 16:00 BST on the dates of the gigs. It will remain closed for a period after each concert, so the public is asked to be aware of this if arranging a safe collection location. Details about accessibility parking and facilities during Belsonic are available here. The Lush Classical, BLK and Boiler Room gigs are strictly over 16s only and Belsonic says valid ID will be required. Under 16s can attend all the other performances, but will require a parent or guardian who is also a ticket holder to accompany them.  There are also some age restrictions on who can enter the front standing section.  Copyright 2025 BBC.

6/5/2025,Article,News,200-year-old condom 'in mint condition' says museum,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/c1de271qg4yo,"An almost 200-year-old condom - in ""mint condition"" - has just gone on display at an exhibition at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. It is thought to be made of a sheep's appendix and features an explicit print representing a nun and three clergymen. The rare artefact dates back to 1830 and was purchased by the museum at an auction last year. The condom is part of an exhibition on 19th Century prostitution and sexuality. Prints, drawings and photographs also form part of the display. Rijksmuseum curator Joyce Zelen told the BBC when she and her colleague first spotted the condom at auction they ""were laughing"".  Ms Zelen said ""no-one else noticed it"" and they were the only ones who bid on it. After obtaining the item, they inspected it with UV light and ascertained that it had not been used.  ""It's in mint condition,"" said Ms Zelen.  Since it was put on display the museum has been packed with people - young and old - and the ""response has been amazing"", she added. Ms Zelen explained the condom is believed to have been a ""luxury souvenir"" from a fancy brothel in France, and that only two such objects are known to have survived to the present day. The museum said the unusual item ""embodies both the lighter and darker sides of sexual health, in an era when the quest for sensual pleasure was fraught with fears of unwanted pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases – especially syphilis"". The explicit print on this specific object shows the nun sitting in front of the three men with her dress up and her legs apart pointing her finger at the clergymen, all of whom are standing in front of her holding up their habits. The condom also bears the inscription ""Voilà mon choix"", meaning ""There is my choice"". The museum noted the print is thus to be considered as a ""parody of both celibacy and the Judgement of Paris from Greek mythology"", the latter being the mythological story of a Trojan Prince named Paris who had to decide who was the fairest goddess among Aphrodite, Hera and Athena. The Dutch museum notes that their Print Room collection holds some 750,000 prints, drawings and photographs but that this is the first example in the collection of a print on a condom. ""As far as we can tell we are the only art museum with a printed condom,"" said Ms Zelen.  She said her institution was ""open to loan"" the artefact out to other museums, but noted that the condom was very delicate. It will be on display until the end of November. Copyright 2025 BBC.

6/5/2025,Article,Travel,Jimmy Choo's well-heeled guide to Kuala Lumpur,https://www.bbc.com//travel/article/20250602-jimmy-choos-guide-to-kuala-lumpur,"His shoes ignited a worldwide sartorial revolution, but he hangs his hat in KL. Here are his top hometown experiences, from enjoying street food to designing your own bespoke suit. Home to the Petronas Twin towers and one of the world's most recognisable skylines, the Malaysian capital has evolved over the last four decades from a modest metropolis known for its charming colonial architecture to a thriving, ultra-modern city. Born in Penang, Jimmy Choo grew up in a family of shoemakers and crafted his first pair aged 11. He studied footwear design in London and shot to fame in the 1990s when he founded his eponymous brand and Princess Diana became a loyal client. In 2021, Choo opened the Jimmy Choo Academy fashion school in Mayfair to nurture the next generation of design talents. The academy's graduate exposition show takes place on 9 June 2025. (Credit: Tet Leon Lee) ""Many years ago, when I came to Kuala Lumpur for the first time, it wasn't as modern,"" says legendary shoe designer Jimmy Choo, who hails from Penang, an island on Malaysia's north-western coast. ""It has changed a lot. There are now lots of high-rise apartments and hotels and it's a lot more multicultural.""  The perennially fashionable Choo, who splits his time between London and Kuala Lumpur where he owns a penthouse apartment a stone's throw from the Petronas Towers in the upmarket KLCC (Kuala Lumpur City Centre) neighbourhood, says the city has also become a major destination for fashion fans on the hunt for high-end bargains. ""A lot of people come here to shop because we have a lot of designer shops and the prices are not too high,"" he says. ""Whether you want to buy shoes, bags, accessories – you can get them all in KL."" If your budget won't stretch to luxury labels, Choo recommends seeking out homegrown talents. ""Malaysia has a lot of local designers who have been very well trained overseas,"" he says. ""They go to study fashion in places like the UK or Australia, then when they've finished their studies, they often come back to their own country to promote their designs."" Beyond retail therapy, the cosmopolitan city is famous for mouthwatering street food from all corners of Asia and plentiful people-watching opportunities at fancy rooftop bars, where you can show off your designer finery while sipping an ice-cold cocktail.  Here are Choo's favourite places for shopping, dining and drinking in the incredible views of Kuala Lumpur. Founded in 1974 by designer Robert Loh, Lord's Tailor specialises in custom suits for men and women and is beloved by many of Malaysia's most stylish celebrities. Kuala Lumpur benefits from balmy temperatures year-round, with monsoon season from November to March. ""I think May to October is the best time to come for a holiday,"" Choo says. ""During rainy season, the weather can be very difficult to predict."" ""It was recently the 50th anniversary of the designer Robert, who learned tailoring and design in London,"" says Choo, a loyal customer since the 1990s. ""Whenever I travel to different parts of the world, they will design all my outfits – daywear and evening wear.""  Providing exceptional sartorial skills at a fraction of the Savile Row price, the atelier's team of tailors and seamstresses can whip up a bespoke or made-to-measure suit in a matter of days.  ""They have their own factory, and all the staff have been very well trained,"" Choo says. ""If you go on a Monday for the measurements, they will have everything ready by Wednesday or Thursday to bring home."" How much will a Lord's Tailor suit set you back? ""It depends on the fabric you choose,"" says Choo. ""Prices start at around 3,000 ringgit (around £515) for a jacket and trousers with one shirt, going up to 10,000 ringgit (around £1,750) if you choose Italian fabric."" Website: www.lordstailor.com.my Address: F18 & F19, 1st floor, Bangsar Shopping Centre, 285 Jalan Maarof Phone: +6 017 670 7217 Instagram: @lordstailor/ A fashionista's paradise, glitzy Pavilion shopping centre is where you'll find the flagship stores of luxury brands such as Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Dior and Hermès alongside high street favourites like Zara and COS. ""Pavilion has got a lot of different brands so there's something to suit every budget,"" Choo says. ""For example, if you want to spend £30 on a shirt or trousers, or if you want to spend thousands and thousands on those higher-level designers."" To sample Malaysian style, try cool handbag brand Sembonia, trendy plus-size fashion pioneer Ms. Read, or Fipper, which sells rubber flip-flops in a vast array of colours. And if you've exhausted your options at Pavilion, pop over the road to another of Choo's favourite retail hotspots, The Starhill, a luxurious shopping centre home to the world's biggest watch gallery. Website: www.pavilion-kl.com Address: 168 Jalan Bukit Bintang Phone: +6 032 118 8833 Showcasing Malaysian handicraft techniques, the Kuala Lumpur Craft Complex is a series of buildings in the Terengganu style with gabled roofs and intricate wood carvings and features a museum where visitors can see how traditional textiles are woven and dyed. ""Batik is hand-painted and uses wax to create the designs,"" Choo explains. ""Songket comes in lots of different colours and has the gold and silver thread woven through. It's quite expensive because it takes some time to weave by hand."" Typically worn on formal occasions, a songket outfit usually comprises a baju kurung long-sleeved shirt, a sarong or trousers, a sampin decorative scarf around the waist and a songkok cap for men. ""Usually when I'm attending my birthday event I wear songket because one of my students designs with songket material,"" Choo says. ""It's common at Malaysian weddings as well. When government people go to functions, they usually wear batik."" Travellers can purchase songket and batik fabric as well as readymade garments and accessories in the Karyaneka Boutique at the Kuala Lumpur Craft Complex. Website: www.kraftangan.gov.my Address: Section 63, Jalan Conlay Phone: +6 032 162 7459 Instagram: @kraftanganmalaysia To refuel after all that shopping, cheap – and delicious – eats are just a five-minute taxi ride from the city's major shopping centres to Chinatown; namely, Petaling Street Market. When packing for a trip to Kuala Lumpur, be sure to include some light layers, Choo advises. ""Outside, it's humid and hot, so you can wear a T-shirt and shorts, but when you go into a shopping mall, cafe or restaurant, it's all air conditioned, so you need something to wear on top. For some reason, cinemas are always very cold, you almost need a winter jacket!"" Reflecting Kuala Lumpur's history as a trading hub since the 6th Century, the market features a blend of Malay, Indian, and Chinese cuisine with hints of Arab, Thai and Portuguese flavours to boot. Choo lists his favourite Petaling Street eats: ""I love char kway teow [stir-fried flat noodles], Hainanese chicken with rice, roti canai [flaky Malaysian flatbread], nasi lemak [rice cooked in coconut milk and pandan leaves served with chilli paste, anchovies and boiled egg], and nasi kandar, which is chicken with spicy curry sauce."" For dessert, he suggests sniffing out a helping of durian, the divisive yellow-fleshed fruit with a spiky exterior and a distinctive aroma. ""Some people like it, some don't,"" says Choo. ""They say it smells like cheese or something like that. But you cannot bring it back to the hotel, they won't allow it because it smells so strong!"" Address: Jalan Petaling, City Centre While many of Kuala Lumpur's rooftop bars look down on the city, WET Deck at the W Hotel is situated on the 12th floor, meaning the neighbouring Petronas Twin Towers provide a dramatic and glittering backdrop when night falls.  ""If I want to have a drink and some good western or Malay food, I normally go to W Hotel bar,"" Choo says.

6/5/2025,Article,Travel,The women saving Japan's vanishing cuisine,https://www.bbc.com//travel/article/20250530-the-women-saving-japans-vanishing-cuisine,"For 450 years, the little-known Ryukyu Kingdom thrived in what is now Japan. Now, after nearly vanishing, its unique fusion cuisine is being revived. ""You can learn a lot about a person by looking at their tongue,"" Yukie Miyaguni tells me in the kitchen-classroom of her second-storey apartment in Uruma, a city on the Japanese island of Okinawa. I've taken a few cooking classes over the years, but this is the first time anyone's ever asked to examine my tongue. With my mouth agape, Miyaguni – a Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) practitioner and Ryukyuan chef – gives my tongue a long look before drawing its likeness on a whiteboard and offering a prescription: ""More cacao at night, honey in the morning and more butter,"" she concludes, noting it will help improve my blood circulation and dry skin.  I didn't come to Okinawa for a diagnosis per se, but in many ways, it was my taste buds that led me to Miyaguni's kitchen. I had been hoping to learn more about the island's elusive and indigenous Ryukyuan cuisine, which can be traced back to the 12th Century when the Ryukyu Islands began trading with other East Asian states. The Ryukyu Islands stretch more than 1,100km, from the southern tip of Kyushu to north-eastern Taiwan. From 1429-1879, the archipelago flourished as a semi-autonomous state known as the Ryukyu Kingdom and was an important cross-section of maritime trade during its 450-year history. Over time, the islands developed a distinctive cultural and culinary identity that blended endemic ingredients like bitter melon, shikuwasa (a lime-like citrus fruit), beni-imo (purple sweet potatoes) and mozuku seaweed with non-native cooking techniques and ingredients. Siamese (modern-day Thai) traders brought indica rice; the Chinese introduced a variety of herbs, teas and pork; and Korean merchants taught residents how to pickle and ferment seafood and vegetables. BBC.com's World's Table ""smashes the kitchen ceiling"" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future. As Miyaguni explained, when the Kingdom's royal family welcomed visiting envoys and magistrates, they did so with a refined style of cooking and customs called ""court cuisine"" (Ukwanshin Ryori), in which portions of hana-ika (sliced squid), minudaru (steamed pork in seasame sauce), gunbomachi (burdock root wrapped in pork) and more were presented in a Ryukyuan lacquerware called a tundabun. When Japan annexed and renamed the island chain Okinawa in 1879, court cuisine spread from the upper echelons of Ryukyuan society to the countryside. Everyday households continued to pass down home-cooked recipes from the islands' more relaxed ""folk cuisine"" as well. But when US forces occupied Okinawa for several decades after World War Two, a mixture of American fast food influence, a rapid assimilation to Japanese culture, food shortages and economic hardships led to the near disappearance of the islands' ancient fusion food culture. Now, thanks to a growing contingent of women like Miyaguni, a resurgence of Ryukyuan cuisine is quietly underway. ""This was the food of our ancestors,"" Miyaguni says, slicing into a pimply green bitter gourd called goya and tossing it into a small mixing bowl along with tofu, eggs and pork to make a traditional style of stir fry called champaru. Meaning ""to mix together"", champaru dishes are often considered the spirit of Okinawa because they reflect the islands' diverse influences. ""By cooking this way,"" Miyaguni continued, ""we honour their [memories] and keep this ancient culture alive."" As with traditional Japanese cuisine on the mainland, Ryukyuan food is rooted in locally sourced and seasonal ingredients. Dishes and ingredients like goya champaru, jimami (peanut) tofu, slow-boiled agu (pork) and umibudo (sea grapes) served in tundabun or Okinawan pottery called yachimun are integral to keeping the traditions of Ryukyuan court cuisine and folk cuisine alive. ""Ryukyuan cuisine is not colourful, so using these plates and lacquerware helped make the food look more vivid,"" Miyaguni explained, pointing to the fire engine-red tundabuncontaining each dish on the table. After we finished kneading the dough for chinsuko (a traditional Okinawan shortbread made of lard, flour and sugar) and placed it in the oven, we sat down to enjoy the fruits of our labour. As I savoured delicate bites of buttery soft peanut tofu, slices of black sesame-coated pork loin and mung bean rice balls wrapped in banana leaves, Miyaguni explained the health benefits of Ryukyuan food. She said ingredients like bitter melon and purple sweet potatoes are high in antioxidants and help lower blood sugar and aid digestion, while awamori, a locally distilled spirit, can aid in gut health. Miyaguni's interest in preserving Ryukyuan food culture is rooted in the Chinese philosophy of food as medicine. After retiring as a nutritionist at a hospital in Okinawa in 2008, Miyaguni encountered TCM and began to learn about its ""deep connection"" to Ryukyuan cuisine. For the last 10 years, Miyaguni has been teaching locals and visitors about the health components of Ryukyuan cuisine from her home. In 2018, she was selected as a representative of Ryukyuan cuisine by the Okinawa Prefectural Governor. ""Until now, Okinawa has been the pride of the world as the island of longevity. However, now the health of the people is deteriorating,"" Miyaguni said. Miyaguni explained that even after the islands were annexed, Ryukyuan folk cuisine was still governed by the Chinese philosophy of ishoku dogen, which emphasises the importance of using high-quality, seasonally available ingredients. Homemade tofu, mugwort soup, purple potato and bitter melon remained staples of folk cuisine, along with the Confucian belief of using all parts of the pig. ""Everything but the oink,"" Miyaguni said. Today, Miyaguni still keeps a book in her kitchen called Gozen Honzō (Edible Plants of Ryukyu), which was written by a chief physician to the king of the Ryukyuan Kingdom. ""Gozen Honzō… explains the types of and used of edible plants, animals and many other foods and a number of sections describe methods of preparing them,"" Miyaguni said. ""We've lost the Ryukyuan language because it isn't taught, but understanding how our ancestors cooked, and teaching these traditions is how we will continue to protect the Ryukyuan culture for future generations,"" she added. While Miyaguni's interest in preserving Ryukyuan cuisine stems from her medicinal background, Kazumi Kayo, a Ryukyuan cooking instructor and food culture ambassador for the Okinawa Prefecture, says her interest in reviving these culinary traditions goes back to her mother. ""When I was young, I was not interested in Ryukyuan cuisine,"" Kayo said. ""However, the memory of the taste that my mother made for me since I was a child came back to me, and I wanted to maintain a cooking method that brought out the taste of these simple ingredients, so I specialised in cooking, obtained a qualification and started a cooking class.""  But Kayo is aware that the region's famous longevity – which many believe is inextricably linked to its diet – is increasingly in peril.  ""For a long time, Okinawa prefecture has maintained the world's longest life expectancy, but with the Westernisation of food, that ranking has dropped, and now the number of people suffering from lifestyle-related diseases is increasing, which is a problem for the prefecture,"" Kayo said.  In 2016, Okinawa's prefectural government developed a programme called Ryukyuan Cuisine Masters to help preserve Ryukyuan food while also addressing rising health concerns. ""About five years ago, we strengthened training for chefs in the food and beverage industry and nutrition associations, provided them with qualifications and started activities to pass on and popularise Ryukyuan cuisine, including traditional cooking methods,"" Kayo added. ""I think the residents of the prefecture will realise the goodness of Ryukyuan cuisine again.""  Now in her 18th year as a Ryukyuan cooking instructor, Kayo runs the Yonner Food Cooking Studio, whose classes start by taking locals and visitors to Makishi Public Market in downtown Naha. ""Yonnerfood' means 'slow food' in Okinawan dialect, and by having a leisurely chat while shopping and taking a cooking class, I hope to help people learn about Okinawa's food culture and develop a love for Okinawa,"" Kayo said.  More like this: • Japan's spectacular bike ride through six remote islands • The eight Asian sauces to keep in your pantry • Japan's 97-year-old cherry blossom guardian In 2019, in an effort to further prevent the decline of Ryukyuan cuisine, the non-profit Ryukyu Cuisine Preservation Association was established to safeguard and promote the culinary heritage of the Ryukyu Kingdom. The same year, ""The Unbroken Legacy of the Ryukyu Kingdom"" and its unique food culture was registered as a national heritage of Japan. In addition to educational cooking classes like Miyaguni's and Kayo's, a handful of Ryukyuan restaurants and food tours have also cropped up across the islands.  Local tour guide Junko Yokoo's Blue Zone Okinawa Home Cooking Tour takes guests to the home of Hiromi Nerome, another certified Ryukyuan cuisine specialist and chef whose own cooking class is based out of her home in the seaside village of Nakijin. ""I started offering this tour in 2022 in response to tourists' interest in Okinawa's 'longevity' cuisine,"" Yokoo tells me. ""Locally grown vegetables like bitter melon and purple sweet potato are quite different from mainland Japan, so people are curious to taste them and learn about what makes Okinawan food so healthy."" In 2024, Suitenrou opened in downtown Naha and offers a mix of Ryukyuan folk and court cuisine along with traditional music and dancing. For a more formal court cuisine-inspired affair, Kuninda also in downtown Naha serves classic dishes like stewed pork cubes in white miso and sea grapes topped with freshly grated wasabi. But if you ask Miyaguni or Kayo, they will tell you that the key to preserving Ryukyuan food culture starts in the kitchen and is best learned through hands-on experience. ""I think that if we can spread the word and attract attention outside the prefecture and abroad, the people of the prefecture will once again realise the goodness of Ryukyuan cuisine,"" Kayo said. ""If Ryukyuan cuisine disappears, we will lose the identity of Okinawa, so we must preserve it.""  -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.  For more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.

6/5/2025,Article,News,Giant 1970s cheese plant rehomed at indoor zoo,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/c7715djgr82o,"A giant cheese plant which has been growing at a Leeds medical school since the 1970s has been rehomed at a nearby indoor zoo. The monster Monstera - named Audrey after the blood-sucking antagonist of the 1986 film Little Shop of Horrors - had lived in the stairwell of Old Medical School at Leeds General Infirmary. Due to building work at the site, the 3m (10ft) tall plant has now been rehoused at nearby Tropical World in Roundhay, which boasts the largest collection of tropical plants outside Kew Gardens. Visitor attraction manager Jo Langton said moving Audrey had been a ""massive challenge"" but they were ""determined to do everything we could to rescue her"". Audrey needed to be trimmed back before she was able to be moved, but has now been replanted in the Rainforest Canopy area. Once established, the NHS plans to install a plaque to explain her history. Ms Langton said: ""She's going to need a lot of TLC and it's still early days, but fortunately we do have an established cheese plant here already which grows extremely well, so we all have our fingers crossed that she'll adapt to her new surroundings. ""We also know that Audrey has quite a following on social media, so we're happy to share that she's still around in Leeds and would love visitors to come along and see her settling in."" Native to central and south America, monstera can grow up to a height of 20m (66ft) in the wild, climbing trees by using a network of aerial roots which hooks over branches. Mohammed Rafique, Leeds City Council's executive member for climate, energy, environment and green space, said: ""It's wonderful that we've been able to give Audrey a new home so her story can continue, and we can preserve a little bit of Leeds history for visitors so enjoy too.""

6/6/2025,Article,News,Russia launches 'massive' strikes days after Ukrainian drone attack,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/cvg7zy1jq7no,"Russia launched large-scale drone and missile strikes on Ukraine's capital and other parts of the country early on Friday, officials said.  At least three people were killed and 49 injured in the strikes, according to Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky. The aerial raids targeted Kyiv, as well as the city of Lutsk and the Ternopil region in the north-west of the country. Russia's defence ministry said the strikes were in response to ""terrorist acts by the Kyiv regime"", adding that it had targeted military sites. The ministry said its armed forces ""overnight launched a massive strike with high-precision long-range air, sea and ground-based weapons, as well as attack drones"". The attack came after Russian President Vladimir Putin warned US President Donald Trump he would respond to Ukraine's recent strikes on Russian airbases.  In a post on X on Friday, Zelensky said that ""now is exactly the moment when America, Europe, and everyone around the world can stop this war together by pressuring Russia"". He made a thinly veiled reference to Trump's apparent unwillingness to put pressure on Russia. ""If someone is not applying pressure and is giving the war more time to take lives – that is complicity and accountability,"" Zelensky wrote. ""We must act decisively."" Zelensky said that ""as of now"", three deaths had been confirmed in the strikes - all employees of Ukraine's state emergency services. He said the attack used more than 400 drones and more than 40 missiles, and the number of people injured ""may increase"". In an earlier statement, Kyiv's Mayor Vitali Klitschko said four people had been killed in the country's capital. Air raid alerts were in place in Kyiv, where a residential building was hit, and the city's train system was disrupted after shelling damaged metro tracks. Tens of thousands of civilians in the capital spent a restless few hours in underground shelters. From the centre of the city, prolonged bursts of machine gun fire could be heard as air defences on the outskirts attempted to bring down scores of drones aimed at Kyiv.  From time to time, the distinctive buzz of drones overhead could also be heard. Bright flashes of light, sometimes reflected on nearby buildings, would be followed, five or ten seconds later, by thunderous explosions. Authorities say the attacks included 38 cruise missiles, which is the kind Ukraine targeted in Sunday's so-called ""Spider's Web"" operation, suggesting this attack could be a message from the Kremlin. The cities of Kharkiv, Sumy and Luhansk were also under air raid alerts. Elsewhere, Ternopil's military chief Vyacheslav Negoda said Friday's strike was the ""most massive air attack on our region to date"". Mayor of Ternopil, Igor Polishchuk, said five people were wounded in the attack and there was damage to homes, schools and a government facility. In Lutsk, five people were injured in an attack using 15 drones and six missiles, according to mayor Ihor Polishchuk.  Meanwhile, the Russian defence ministry said its air defences shot down 174 Ukrainian drones overnight in parts of Russia and occupied Crimea.  The ministry said Neptune anti-ship cruise missiles were also intercepted over the Black Sea.  Russia's latest attack on Ukraine comes days after Kyiv launched its biggest long-range drone strike on at least 40 Russian warplanes at four military bases. Zelensky said 117 drones were used in the Spider's Web operation by the SBU security service, striking ""34% of [Russia's] strategic cruise missile carriers"". Earlier this month, direct peace talks between Russia and Ukraine took place in Istanbul, but ended without a major breakthrough.  Ukrainian negotiators said Russia rejected an ""unconditional ceasefire"" - a key demand of Kyiv and its Western allies including the US. The Russian team said they had proposed a two-or three-day truce ""in certain areas"" of the vast front line, but gave no further details. Trump said Putin vowed to ""very strongly"" respond to Ukraine's recent attack on Russian airbases, during a phone call that lasted more than an hour on Wednesday.  Moscow had previously said that military options were ""on the table"" for its response to Ukraine's attack. Last week, Trump appeared to set a two-week deadline for Putin, threatening to change how the US is responding to Russia if he believed Putin was still ""tapping"" him along on peace efforts in Ukraine.

6/6/2025,Article,News,How bitter feud escalated - and what happens next,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/c3wd2215q08o,"What happens when the richest person and the most powerful politician have a knock-down, drag-out fight? The world is finding out – and it's not a pretty picture. Donald Trump and Elon Musk have two of the biggest megaphones, and they have now turned them on each other, as a disagreement has ballooned into a war of words. Trump has threatened Musk's voluminous business dealings with the federal government, which form the lifeblood of his SpaceX programme. ""The easiest way to save money in our budget, billions and billions of dollars, is to terminate Elon's governmental subsidies and contracts,"" Trump posted menacingly on his own social media website. If Trump turns the machinery of government against Musk, the tech billionaire will feel pain. Tesla's stock price plunged by 14% on Thursday. It's not a one-way street, however. After that volley, Musk called for Trump's impeachment and dared him to cut funding for his companies.  Musk also said he was accelerating the decommissioning of his Dragon spacecraft, which the US relies on to carry American astronauts and supplies to the International Space Station.  But hours later, he appeared to back down from that threat, saying in response to a post on X urging him to cool off: ""Good advice. Ok, we won't decommission Dragon."" Musk has near limitless resources to respond, including by funding insurgent challengers to Republicans in next year's elections and primaries. And late on Thursday afternoon, he said he was dropping the ""really big bomb"" – suggesting without evidence that Trump appears in unreleased files related to late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.  His press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, offered only a tepid pushback to Musk's allegations and accusations. ""This is an unfortunate episode from Elon, who is unhappy with the One Big Beautiful Bill because it does not include the policies he wanted,"" she said.  Musk may not win a fight against the whole of Trump's government, but he could exact a high political - and personal - price for Trump and the Republicans. Trump, perhaps aware of this, appeared to tamp down the heat a bit by the end of the day. He avoided commenting on Musk during a public appearance at a White House event and posted a message on Truth Social that said he didn't mind ""turning against him"", but wishes he had quit government service months ago.  He then pivoted to boosting of his ""big, beautiful"" tax and spending legislation. It's difficult to envision an easy walk-down after Thursday's heat, however. The feud started at a simmer last week, began bubbling on Wednesday and became a full-on boil on Thursday afternoon in the Oval Office. As new German Chancellor Friedrich Merz – the day's visitor – sat in awkward silence, the president sounded a bit like a spurned lover. He expressed surprise at Musk's criticism of his legislation. He pushed back against the notion that he would have lost last year's presidential election without Musk's hundreds of millions of dollars in support. And he said Musk was only changing his tune now because his car company, Tesla, will be hurt by the Republican push to end electric vehicle tax credits. Musk quickly took to his social media site, X, with a very Generation X response for his 220 million followers: ""Whatever"".  He said he didn't care about the car subsidies, and that he wanted to shrink the national debt, which he says is an existential threat to the nation. He insisted that Democrats would have prevailed in last year's election without his help. ""Such ingratitude,"" he told Trump. The billionaire then launched a series of extraordinary attacks throughout the afternoon, and the feud was on in earnest. Musk and Trump had formed a powerful but unlikely alliance, culminating in the tech billionaire having a key position of budget-slashing authority in the Trump administration. Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, or Doge, became one of the biggest stories of Trump's first 100 days, as it shuttered entire agencies and dismissed thousands of government workers. It wasn't long, however, before speculation began over when – and how - the two outsized personalities would ultimately fall out. For a while, it seemed like those predictions were off the mark. Trump stood by Musk even as the latter's popularity dropped, as he feuded with administration officials and as he became a liability in several key elections earlier this year.  Every time it appeared there would be a break, Musk would pop up in the Oval Office, or the Cabinet room or on the president's Air Force One flight to Mar-a-Lago. When Musk's 130 days as a ""special government employee"" ended last week, the two had a chummy Oval Office send-off, with a golden key to the White House and hints that Musk might someday return. It's safe to say that any invitation has been rescinded and the locks have been changed. ""Elon and I had a great relationship,"" Trump said on Thursday – a comment notable for its use of the past tense. There had been some thought that Trump's surprise announcement on Wednesday night of a new travel ban, additional sanctions on Harvard and a conspiracy-laced administration investigation of former President Joe Biden were all efforts to change the subject from Musk's criticism. The White House and its allies in Congress seemed careful not to further antagonise him after his earlier comments. Then Trump spoke out and… so much for that. Now the question is where the dispute goes next. Congressional Republicans could find it harder to keep their members behind Trump's bill with Musk providing rhetorical and, perhaps financial, air cover for those who break ranks. Trump has already threatened Musk's government contracts, but he could also take aim at his remaining Doge allies in the administration or reopen Biden-era investigations into Musk's business dealings. Everything at this point is on the table. Meanwhile, Democrats are on the sidelines, wondering how to respond. Few seem willing to welcome Musk, a former donor to their party, back into the fold. But there's also the old adage that the enemy of an enemy is a friend. ""It's a zero-sum game,"" Liam Kerr, a Democratic strategist, told Politico. ""Anything that he does that moves more toward Democrats hurts Republicans."" At the very least, Democrats seem happy to stand back and let the two men exchange blows. And until they abandon this fight, the din is likely to drown out everything else in American politics. But don't expect this spat to end anytime soon. ""Trump has 3.5 years left as president,"" Musk wrote on X, ""but I will be around for 40-plus years.""

6/6/2025,Article,News,India leads in remittances - but Trump's tax could deal a blow ,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/cvg98erzl8eo,"Tucked deep in Donald Trump's sprawling ""One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act"" is a clause that could quietly take billions from money sent abroad. It proposes a 3.5% tax on remittances sent abroad by foreign workers, including green card holders and temporary visa workers such as those on H-1B visas. For India - the world's top remittance recipient - the implications are serious, say experts. Other major recipients include Mexico, China, the Philippines, France, Pakistan and Bangladesh. In 2023, Indians abroad sent home $119bn (£88bn) - enough to finance half of India's goods trade deficit and outpace foreign direct investment, according to a paper by Reserve Bank of India (RBI) economists. Of this, the largest share came from the US. For millions of migrants, that includes the money wired to cover a parent's medicine, a nephew's tuition or a mortgage back home. A blunt levy on remittances could skim billions from migrant workers, many of whom already pay taxes in America. The likely result? A rise in informal, untraceable cash transfers and a dent in India's most stable source of external financing. India has remained the top recipient of remittances since 2008, with its share rising from 11% in 2001 to 14% in 2024, according to World Bank. India’s central bank says that remittances are expected to stay strong, reaching an estimated $160bn by 2029. The country's remittances have consistently hovered around 3% of GDP since 2000. India's international migrant population grew from 6.6 million in 1990 to 18.5 million in 2024, with its global share rising from 4.3% to over 6%. While the Gulf still hosts nearly half of all Indian migrants, skilled migration to advanced economies - especially the US - has increased significantly, driven by India's global IT footprint.  The US remains the top source of remittances worldwide, with its share rising from 23.4% in 2020–21 to nearly 28% in 2023–24, driven by a strong post-pandemic job recovery and a 6.3% rise in foreign-born workers in 2022. Notably, 78% of Indian migrants in the US work in high-earning sectors such as management, business, science, and the arts. Remittance costs - driven by fees and currency conversion - have long been a global policy concern due to their impact on families. While global averages of the costs remain above targets, India stands out as one of the most affordable destinations, reflecting the rise of digital channels and heightened market competition. A 10-15% drop in remittances could cost India $12-18bn a year, tightening dollar supply and putting pressure on the rupee, according to Ajay Srivastava of Delhi-based think tank Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI). He reckons the central bank may have to step in more often to stabilise the currency. The bigger blow would land on households in states such as Kerala, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, where remittances fund essentials like education, healthcare and housing. The tax could ""hit household consumption hard"" even as the Indian economy grapples with global uncertainty and inflation, Mr Srivastava says in a note. The remittance tax could squeeze Indian household budgets, dampen consumption and investment, and undermine one of India's steadiest sources of foreign exchange, warns a brief by the Delhi-based Centre for WTO Studies. Maharashtra, followed by Kerala and Tamil Nadu, continues to be among the dominant recipient states. Remittances in India are largely used for household consumption, savings and investment in assets like housing, gold and small businesses. according to a policy brief by the think tank's Pritam Banerjee, Saptarshee Mandal and Divyansh Dua.  A drop in inflows could shrink domestic savings and reduce investment in both financial and physical assets. When remittance inflows decline, households are likely to ""prioritise consumption needs (e.g. food, healthcare, and education) over savings and investment"", the brief says. A study by Center for Global Development, a Washington-based think tank, suggests the proposed tax could sharply cut formal transfers, with Mexico facing the biggest hit - over $2.6bn annually. Other major losers include India, China, Vietnam and several Latin American nations like Guatemala, the Dominican Republic and El Salvador. To be sure, there's still some confusion surrounding the tax, and final approval is pending Senate action and the President's signature. ""The tax applies to all non-citizens and even embassy and UN/World Bank staff. But those who pay taxes can claim a tax credit. Thus, the remittance tax would apply only to those migrants who do not pay taxes. That would mostly include unauthorised migrants (and diplomats),"" Dilip Ratha, the World Bank lead economist for migration and remittances, told the BBC. Dr Ratha wrote in a note on LinkedIn that migrants would try to cut remittance costs by turning to informal methods - hand-carrying cash, sending money through friends, couriers, bus drivers or airline staff, arranging local currency payouts via friends in the US, or using hawala, hundi and cryptocurrencies.  ""Will the proposed tax deter unauthorised immigration to the US? Will it encourage unauthorised migrants to return home?"" wonders Dr Ratha. Not quite, he says. A minimum wage job in the US earns over $24,000 a year -  roughly four to 30 times more than in many developing countries. Migrants typically send home between $1,800 and $48,000 annually, estimates Dr Ratha.  ""A 3.5% tax is unlikely to deter these remittances. After all the main motivation for migration - migrants trying to cross oceans and rivers and mountains - is to send money home to help helpless family members.""   Copyright 2025 BBC.

6/6/2025,Article,News,India central bank delivers sharp rate cut as growth and inflation fall,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/c62vdq6g945o,"India's central bank has lowered interest rates by a deeper-than-expected half a percent - the third cut in a row amid falling inflation and lower growth in Asia's third largest economy.  It also increased the amount of liquidity - or supply of money - available in the system.  The repo rate - the level at which the central bank lends money to commercial banks, influencing borrowing costs for home and car loans - now stands at 5.5%, the lowest in three years. Explaining the rationale for the cut, RBI governor Sanjay Malhotra said growth is  ""lower than our aspirations"" and the bank felt it was ""imperative to stimulate domestic consumption and investment"" amid rising global uncertainties. The rate cut comes on the back of two previous reductions in April and February. Data released last week showed that India's economy grew by 6.5% in the previous financial year ending March.

6/6/2025,Article,News,Bouncy castle operator cleared in tragedy that killed six,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/c4gr5kn5d7go,"An Australian bouncy castle operator at the centre of a tragedy in 2021 that killed six children and seriously injured three has been cleared of breaching safety laws. A court found Rosemary Anne Gamble, who runs the business Taz-Zorb, not guilty, ruling that the incident was ""due to an unprecedented weather system"" that was ""impossible to predict"". The victims, who were on a bouncy castle at a primary school fun day in Devonport, Tasmania, fell about 10m (33ft) after strong winds blew the castle skywards at a school fair. The verdict on Friday caused anguish among their families, with some crying out in court in disbelief, ABC News reported. Prosecutors had accused Ms Gamble of failing to anchor the castle adequately, but her defence argued she could not have done more to eliminate or reduce hazards that led to the tragedy. Magistrate Robert Webster agreed with the defence and found that the incident happened due to a dust devil - an upward spiralling vortex of air and debris - that was ""unforeseen and unforeseeable"". ""Ms Gamble could have done more or taken further steps, however, given the effects of the unforeseen and unforeseeable dust devil, had she done so, that would sadly have made no difference to the ultimate outcome,"" the magistrate said. The six children killed in the accident - Addison Stewart, Zane Mellor, Jye Sheehan, Jalailah Jayne-Maree Jones, Peter Dodt and Chace Harrison - were aged between 11 and 12. They were all at a Hillcrest Primary School fair when the accident took place on the last day of term before the school holidays in December 2021. Five of the children were on the castle when the gales swept it up and flung it across the school oval.  The sixth child, who was waiting in line, died after being struck in the head by the inflatable blower. The tragic accident shattered Devonport, a city on the north coast of Tasmania with some 30,000 residents. Ms Gamble was charged nearly two years after, in November 2023.  Andrew Dodt, the father of one of the young victims Peter, said after Friday's verdict that ""our hopes are just shattered now"". ""At the end of the day all I wanted was an apology for my son not coming home, and I'm never going to get it, and that kills me,"" he said in a statement to local media. ""I've been broken for a long time, and I think I'm going to be broken for a lot more."" Ms Gamble's lawyer Bethan Frake spoke on her behalf, acknowledging that the incident has caused ""scars that will remain for an extremely long time, likely forever"". ""I am a mother,"" she said, quoting Ms Gamble. ""I can only imagine the pain that other parents are living with each and every day because of this terrible thing that happened."" ""Their loss is something I will carry with me for the rest of my life."" Copyright 2025 BBC.

6/6/2025,Article,News,India central bank delivers sharp rate cut as growth and inflation fall,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/c62vdq6g945o,"India's central bank has lowered interest rates by a deeper-than-expected half a percent - the third cut in a row amid falling inflation and lower growth in Asia's third largest economy.  It also increased the amount of liquidity - or supply of money - available in the system.  The repo rate - the level at which the central bank lends money to commercial banks, influencing borrowing costs for home and car loans - now stands at 5.5%, the lowest in three years. Explaining the rationale for the cut, RBI governor Sanjay Malhotra said growth is  ""lower than our aspirations"" and the bank felt it was ""imperative to stimulate domestic consumption and investment"" amid rising global uncertainties. The rate cut comes on the back of two previous reductions in April and February. Data released last week showed that India's economy grew by 6.5% in the previous financial year ending March. The country remains the world's fastest expanding major economy, although growth has sharply dropped from the 9.2% high recorded in financial year 2023-24.

6/6/2025,Article,News,Handwritten notes reveal Churchill's penicillin concern ahead of D-Day,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/cj09v52l8v4o,"Winston Churchill's push to obtain penicillin in time to treat casualties expected from D-Day has come to light in documents seen by BBC News. Official papers unearthed by the National Archives reveal the prime minister's frustration and concern over slow progress securing supplies of what was then seen to be a brand new ""wonder drug"". The BBC was shown the papers ahead of the anniversary of the Normandy landings on 6 June 1944. Even months after D-Day, the wartime prime minister called efforts ""very disappointing"" and bemoaned the fact the US was ""so far ahead"" despite the drug being a ""British discovery"". Penicillin was discovered in London by Professor Alexander Fleming in 1928. Despite attempts to produce a usable medicine from the bacteria-killing mould, this had not been achieved by the start of World War Two.  But an Oxford team of scientists, led by Howard Florey, carried out the first successful trials. With large-scale production difficult in the UK, they took their research to the United States, where drug companies expanded output. Before the development of penicillin, blood poisoning could follow even minor wounds with no cure available. So with the anticipation of the huge military effort ahead, supplies of the drug were seen as essential. Early in 1944, the prime minister was complaining to his ministers about Britain's inability to produce it at scale. He scrawled in red ink on a Ministry of Supply report that said the Americans were producing greater quantities: ""I am sorry we can't produce more"". Later in the year, in response to explanations from officials, he said: ""Your report on penicillin showing that we are only to get about one-tenth of the expected output this year, is very disappointing.""  On another report, he instructs: ""Let me have proposals for a more abundant supply from Great Britain"".  Less than a fortnight before D-Day, health officials could report that sufficient supplies had been obtained, most from the US, but only for battle casualties. Dr Jessamy Carlson, modern records specialist at The National Archives, said: ""The files give a glimpse into the extraordinary levels of preparation undertaken in advance of the D-Day landings.  ""Only six weeks before, penicillin is just reaching our shores in quantities which will allow it to play a major role in improving the outcomes for service personnel wounded in action."" But what's now seen as the first true antibiotic would not be fully available to the general public till 1946.  A telegram in the same files shows a doctor from Cornwall, who was treating a 10-year-old child in 1944, pleading with the authorities for the medicine: ""No hope without penicillin"".  The plea was rejected, with supplies said to be only available for military use. With antibiotics now part of everyday life (and arguably too widely used), the documents seen by the BBC shed new light on the urgent efforts by Churchill and others to secure enough of one such drug for the first time to save lives during the struggle to liberate northern Europe.

6/6/2025,Article,Future,The 'giant firework' built to break Hitler's Atlantic Wall,https://www.bbc.com//future/article/20250603-the-giant-firework-built-to-break-hitlers-atlantic-wall,"To make D-Day a success, the Allies thought they might have to break through formidable German defences. One unconventional idea was a ""giant firework"" that would deliver a one-tonne bomb: the Panjandrum. After conquering much of Western Europe in the first few years of World War II, Nazi Germany then diverted a huge effort into protecting what it had invaded. Once the United States entered the war on the side of the Allies in late 1941, the threat of invasion from the sea went from a distinct possibility to certainty. To prevent it, hundreds of thousands of forced labourers – some of them Russian prisoners captured on the Eastern Front – were set to work. They built walls, tank traps and reinforced-concrete emplacements. The fortifications stretched around 5,000km (3,105 miles) from France's border with Spain all the way to the northern tip of Norway.  Adolf Hitler called it the ""Atlantic Wall"", and there are still many traces of it, littering beaches from the Bay of Biscay to the sub-Arctic fjords.  Allied military planners had many challenges to wrestle with during their long preparations for the liberation of Europe. Seizing a port made the most sense – it would be easier to get vital supplies to the troops on the beachhead by unloading ships more speedily on the docks. But the ports on the English Channel coast had been heavily fortified by German defenders. A bold plan to temporarily take over one of these ports – Dieppe, in France – in August 1942 showed how difficult a port would be to capture. Thousands of mostly Canadian troops were killed or captured in a botched attempt to push through defences; supporting tanks became bogged down on loose shingle sand and the built-up surroundings gave the defenders plenty of cover from which to fire on the invading forces. Dieppe, it turned out, had the wrong kind of beach. The French coast had plenty of beaches firm enough to support tanks and other vehicles coming ashore, but these beaches would be overlooked by the Atlantic Wall defences the Germans were quickly building. How could they be breached, with the minimum loss to Allied soldiers? An eccentric plan was born…  Nevil Shute Norway was an accomplished aeronautical engineer who had worked on one of Britain's most high-profile airship designs. The R100 airship had been designed by engineer Barnes Wallis – who would later invent the bouncing bomb of Dambusters fame – for engineering firm Vickers, with funding from the government. Norway later took over as chief engineer when Wallis left to work on other projects. The R100, intended for long-distance voyages across the British Empire, carried out successful publicity tours as far afield as Canada. It was developed alongside a similar airship designed and built by the UK's Air Ministry, called R101; this design was fatally flawed, and crashed with the loss of 48 lives in northern France while on its maiden flight.  News of the crash flashed around the world, killing Britain's emerging airship industry for good, and Norway drifted into more conventional aircraft designs, including the highly successful Oxford trainer designed by his own aircraft company, Airspeed. When war broke out, Norway joined the Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve, initially serving on naval ships. But his flair for engineering took him in a different direction: into the navy's secret department for experimental weapons. The Directorate of Miscellaneous Weapon Development was known informally as the ""wheezers and dodgers"". They drew bookish, lab-bound talent from the UK's universities and research institutes and challenged them to come up with new weapons that could be used in the war. No idea, however outlandish, was discouraged. One of the weapons the British armed forces needed was something that could be deployed from a ship and was powerful enough to breach the strong concrete sea wall now in place across much of Europe. From there, Allied forces could hopefully capture the ports needed to sustain a sea invasion from behind, where they would be less well-defended. Norway and team did the calculations and arrived at a minimum explosive weight to break through the concrete defences: a tonne of high explosives. Placed against the wall, this should be enough to blow a tank-sized hole that will allow invading troops and vehicles to pour through. But to drive it up across a well-defended beach was likely to be too hazardous. Norway and the naval research team turns to an unlikely inspiration: a firework known as the Catherine wheel. The firework uses part of the energy of the rocket, which is usually pinned to the structure, to spin; it makes a much more impressive display. Enough rockets, the team calculated, could generate enough energy to propel a one-tonne bomb all the way up to the beach to hit the concrete wall.  Obviously, to be able to hold a one-tonne bomb, the device would need to be a very large Catherine wheel, one that could be controlled remotely.  Norway and his team eventually came up with a device that looked like a large film reel, with two wheels 10ft (3m) high, on either side of a large steel tank that contained the explosive charge. Spaced around either side of the two giant wheels were a series of rockets containing cordite (gunpowder) which could be controlled remotely and would propel the device forward once the rockets ignited. The contraption might reach speeds in excess of 60mph (100 km/h), giving it enough momentum to push through any obstacles until it hit the wall. Norway and his team called their device ""the Panjandrum"". The Panjandrum exemplifies the anything-goes attitude that British military thinkers adopted, says David Willey, the recently retired curator at The Tank Museum in Bovington in the UK. And it also feeds into a kind of ""national myth"", he says, that there is always some kind of unconventional inventor that will save the day. ""We love this idea,"" he says. ""We've got all these boffins with round thick glasses in back rooms all over the place that we task to come up with answers and they're always going to be saying 'If only they'd listened to me earlier'. They're fed questions, they're told the problem.""  ""This idea of blasting holes in sea walls or major defensive wall is quite a big one,"" Willey adds. The idea, however far-fetched it sounds now, the idea of some massive Catherine wheel with rockets on and it goes over rolls towards wherever where it's then detonated with a huge charge."" The Panjandrum comes before an age of miniaturised electronics, but in a way it presages the age of the drone – a weapon that can be sent into battle without a human needing to pilot it.  ""In its broadest sense the Panjandrum makes a lot of sense because you're delivering a huge amount of explosives to one single point, the concrete encasements and the Atlantic Wall,"" says Rob Rumble, a curator at the Imperial War Museums in the UK. He says the Panjandrum had to do three things: it had to be robust enough to carry its heavy load up the beach, it had to be able to carry enough explosives to successfully breach the concrete, and it had to be able to do this accurately – ""which was the great failing in the end"".  ""In many ways, I'm also sceptical as to its ability to roll over those defences as well,"" adds Rumble. ""So in a way, the only thing going for it was the fact that it could carry a huge amount of explosives."" The Panjandrum was built in secret in east London and then transported to the west of England for testing. The first test took place at Westward Ho! in Devon in September 1943. The need to test it on a beach conditions completely scuppered the project's secrecy. The team had to test it in front of a crowd of curious civilians, who ignored military warnings that the machine was possibly hazardous. The Panjandrum was successfully launched from a landing craft, but as it moved up the beach rockets on one of the wheels detached, and the lumbering machine quickly blundered off to the side. Norway and his team made many modifications to the Panjandrum and its array of rockets, but several more tests fared little better. One video which has been preserved by the Imperial War Museum in London shows the weapon careering over the beach throwing up a huge spray of sand and seawater – all the while being chased by an excited dog. (Panjandrum footage starts at 2.51.) ""You know it always makes me laugh when we see this footage of this top-secret stuff and there seems to be half a dozen families down there sitting around having a picnic at the same time in the background."" With the planned invasion of France drawing ever closer, time was running out to finetune the Panjandrum. In January 1944 – just five months before the eventual D-Day landings – a last test took place in front of a crowd of military observers. In 1977, the BBC produced a documentary series called The Secret War, and producer Brian Johnson described the final Panjandrum test: ""At first all went well. Panjandrum rolled into the sea and began to head for the shore, the brass hats watching through binoculars from the top of a pebble ridge [...] Then a clamp gave: first one, then two more rockets broke free: Panjandrum began to lurch ominously. It hit a line of small craters in the sand and began to turn to starboard, careering towards [photographer Louis] Klemantaski, who, viewing events through a telescopic lens, misjudged the distance and continued filming. Hearing the approaching roar he looked up from his viewfinder to see Panjandrum, shedding live rockets in all directions, heading straight for him. ""As he ran for his life, he glimpsed the assembled admirals and generals diving for cover behind the pebble ridge into barbed-wire entanglements. Panjandrum was now heading back to the sea but crashed on to the sand where it disintegrated in violent explosions, rockets tearing across the beach at great speed."" Panjandrum had failed for the final time, and the project was quietly scrapped. The idea of a weapon that would make its way to its target under its own steam was outlandish for the time, but makes far more sense today, says Rumble. ""In its concept the Panjandrum was a good idea, you know, the sort of indirect unmanned weapons that you see today but in much more advanced form with drone warfare. But otherwise, the technology to drive and navigate the machine just wasn't there at the time.""  ""Hindsight is wonderful,"" says Willey. ""'This one doesn't work.' Lots of experiments we do don't work. Now, that doesn't mean to say all those experiments are therefore failures. Because number one is you're writing something off the list. So often technology jumps from one project to another, you'll see that happening loads of times. ""In many ways, it baffles me to a certain extent, that the, the solid rocket power was even considered an idea,"" says Rumble. ""Little solid booster rockets aren't 100% an exact science either, depending on how much fuel you have in each one, and how successfully they ignite."" In the end, success on the D-Day beaches came partly due to another unconventional weapon – modified tanks collectively known as ""Funnies"". Led by the eccentric Percy Hobart, normal tanks were modified to do everything from swim to shore using canvas floatation devices, clear minefields with whirling chains, lay steel matting over soft sand or lob dustbin-sized shells at concrete emplacements. They played a massive part in making the landings on 6 June 1944 a success. As for Norway? Panjandrum was a failure, but other projects Shute Norway masterminded during his time in the Navy – such as an anti-submarine depth charge system called ""Hedgehog"" – were far more successful. But engineering was just one of his callings. Since the 1920s, he had been publishing stories and novels, writing under a pen name because he worried his fiction could detract from the seriousness of his engineering. His pen-name? Nevil Shute. In the years after the war, he became one of the world's most popular novelists. The Panjandrum remains a dazzling example of an unconventional approach to warfare, abandoned when tests proved its shortcomings. But could it have been made to work? In recent years, some non-military minds have decided to give the idea another pass, such as Adam Savage, the former Mythbusters host who now fronts the TV programme Savage Builds. In 2020, Savage decided to see if he could improve the design enough that it might be able to carry out a peacetime mission, building a miniature Panjandrum. Putting five rockets on each wheel generated more than 10 times the thrust-to-weight ratio, and a slight delay in one of the rockets firing caused the machine to careen wildly off course. Cutting it down to three rockets each side helped, but the results were still far from successful. Another, bigger Panjandrum was built in 2009 to mark the 65th anniversary of the D-Day landings. Constructed for the Appledore Book Festival, it was created by Skyburst, an industrial pyrotechnics company based in Bristol in the UK. ""We got contacted by a chap from the book festival, to say, 'You know, we're thinking of doing this, is this something you could help with?'"" says Alan Christie, the owner of Skyburst. ""I mean, we love doing fireworks, but it's always great to have something different, you know."" Skyburst's Panjandrum, like Savage's, did not contain an explosive charge. But it was much bigger, with the wheels reaching 6ft high (1.8m). Christie knew very little about the Panjandrum, and had do a crash course in the weapon's design. ""It was really good to actually get involved and learn more about it."" Christie says wistfully that it was ""a shame"" they couldn't use the same kind of solid-fuel rockets as the wildly unpredictable original. The centre of their Panjandrum was a large cable drum, to which the team from Skyburst attached a number of rocket motors, before it was moved down to the beach and launched. ""It probably took us about five, six hours in total, to attach all the drivers and get it in position on the beach,"" says Christie. ""One of the things I wanted to try and simulate it as the landing craft pulled up they dropped down the front of it like a ramp, and it [the Panjandrum] was supposed to roll off. So we built a small ramp ourselves, and then we tied it up with what we call it 'black match', it's just like plastic-covered gunpowder rope. ""We fired it, and it fired the black match as well, which released it and let it go."" Christie says Skyburst tried to make their miniaturised Panjandrum as faithful as possible to the original.  More like this: • The flawed Soviet glider tank • The shape of tanks to come • The strange tanks that helped win D-Day  ""We got it about 50m (165ft),"" he says. ""It looked spectacular. I think it actually looked better than the originals did, with all the sparks snarling off it and stuff."" There is no doubt that this odd weapon was built – we have the pictures, footage and testimony of confused onlookers to corroborate it – but there remains a tantalising hint that the Panjandrum may have been an elaborate ploy to fool the German defenders that the Normandy landings were to take place far closer to one of the fortified ports. Was the Panjandrum ultimately an intelligence tool, rather than something that would have been used in anger? ""I think it was a trick, to be honest,"" says Christie. ""They were very open about testing it. A lot of the other secret weapons that they built, nobody got to see what they were or knew anything about them. It was supposed to roll up the beach and hit certain defences. When you look at the Normandy beaches, there was barbed wire and things like that, but there wasn't anything for them to actually crash it into."" Perhaps the Panjandrum was not intended to be a secret weapon at all…  -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.

6/6/2025,Article,Culture,A death-defying D-day mission in a wooden glider,https://www.bbc.com//culture/article/20240531-how-ww2s-d-day-began-with-a-death-defying-mission-in-a-wooden-aircraft,"Eighty years ago on 6 June, D-Day, the largest land, air and naval operation in history was unleashed to fight the Nazis – led by a group of British troops who crash-landed in Normandy in six flimsy gliders. In 1984, the man who led this mission gave an extraordinary account to the BBC. D-Day was a marvel of planning; it involved the simultaneous landing of tens of thousands of Allied troops on five separate beaches in Nazi-occupied northern France. The British and Canadians would land on three beaches in Normandy, codenamed Sword, Juno and Gold. The Americans were to capture Omaha and Utah beaches.  Major John Howard and his company's part in this elaborate plan required perfect navigation, great daring and complete surprise. Their mission was to capture two bridges intact – Bénouville Bridge, later known as Pegasus Bridge, over the Caen canal, and Ranville Bridge, later renamed Horsa Bridge, over the adjacent River Orne. Because these road bridges were the only way across the parallel water obstacles, capturing them would mean they could stop German reinforcements from reaching the beaches where the Allied armies would land later that day.   Preparation for this audacious glider mission was intense. Thousands of aerial photographs were taken of the bridges and their defences mapped in detail. The British even created a model of the area which was modified to match each day's aerial photograph. When the Germans cut down trees, the model-makers did the same. The idea of using gliders was that troops and heavier weapons could be landed in the same place behind enemy lines, without the need for parachutes. Because of the need to conserve metal supplies during wartime, the gliders were made mostly of spruce and plywood. They were tricky to operate, and liable to break apart upon landing.   Major Howard's 180-strong company of the Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry, from the 6th Airborne Division, had been training for this moment for two years. For many, this would be their first experience of combat. After abandoning their crashed aircraft, they would have to have to fight on foot.   While the name ""glider"" may imply a calm journey, Major Howard admitted to BBC current affairs programme 60 Minutes in 1984 that travelling in these aircraft was anything but smooth. ""Most of us were sick in gliders, but the funny thing is that the only time I was never sick in a glider, and I must have done 12 or 13 flights altogether with training, was on the night of D-Day,"" he said. Towed by heavy bomber planes, the six gliders took off from Tarrant Rushton, a Royal Air Force base in southern England, at 22:56 on 5 June 1944. After about an hour in the air, the gliders were released from their restraints to begin their final descent into enemy territory.   Major Howard said when the order was given to prepare for landing, all they could do was interlock arms and fingers with their comrades and hope for the best. ""You're sitting facing one another, you link arms, you do a butcher's grip like that, you lift your legs and you just pray to God,"" he said. ""Before we almost had time to do that, there was the first thump of a landing, and it was a hell of a crash. And before we knew it, we were airborne again – we'd obviously bounced. On that first bounce, the wheels had come off.   More like this: • The WW2 army that didn't exist • Britain's mysterious WW2 'Island of Death' • The 1970 student protest that shook the US ""We expected that because it was a very bumpy old field, it wasn't like an airfield, and we were going to land on skids. Then there was another thundering crash, and this time I saw sparks, or what looked like Tracer (bullets) going past the door of the window, and I thought, 'my God, they're ready for us. They know we've arrived.'"" The glider bounced again and then came to a juddering halt. They had survived the crash landing. Would they now be met with a hail of German bullets? For Major Howard, everything went dark. ""It occurred to me that there was no firing, and I couldn't see anything,"" he said. ""The first fear was that I'd been blinded in the crash. I felt my body, that felt alright, and then I realised that all that happened was my battle bowler had come down over my eyes. I'd hit the top of the glider."" With only moonlight to guide them, the gliders had landed in silence just 30 metres (98 ft) from their target.   The German garrison was taken by surprise, as Colonel Hans von Luck acknowledged 40 years later. Major Howard and Colonel von Luck would later become good friends in the 1960s through their involvement in giving military lectures, and both men were back in Normandy for the 40th anniversary. Colonel Von Luck said they had not treated these bridges as being important as they believed there were too many complicating factors that prevented the Allies to attack there. ""I think it was a fantastic operation, and I think personally that was the beginning of the end,"" he said.   While Major Howard and his men had won the first battle of D-Day, the disadvantage of going in first was they were left to defend the bridges on their own for hours until reinforcements arrived via sea. When Nazi tanks rumbled in to attack, Charles ""Wagger"" Thornton was lying in wait in a nearby hedgerow, armed with his PIAT (Projector, Infantry, Anti-Tank) weapon, and trying desperately to hold his nerve. ""These PIATs, they're not very effective past 50 yards, so you've got to wait for 30 to 40 yards to get the best out of them,"" he told 60 Minutes. ""The more this bloody tank kept coming, the more shaken I was getting. Anyhow I waited and I thought to myself, 'Well this is it', because it was dark as well, and I let go. Lucky for me, it hit the thing smack in the middle."" At that same time, local café owners Georges and Thérèse Gondrée were sheltering with their children in the cellars. Soon afterwards, Georges was in the garden digging up 98 bottles of champagne which had remained buried throughout the war, waiting for this day. They were the first people in France to be liberated from the Nazis. Major Howard carried with him an unforgettable mental image of that moment. ""Dear Madame, of course, went round kissing all my men and all the paras and all our black camouflage paint was transferred to her face,"" he said. ""That dear old soul, she wandered around that café with that black paint on for three days. She wouldn't wash it off.""  In History is a series which uses the BBC's unique audio and video archive to explore historical events that still resonate today. Subscribe to the accompanying weekly newsletter. Forty years on, Major Howard reunited with Madame Gondrée to lay a wreath at the grave of Lieutenant Den Brotheridge, the first Allied soldier to be killed on D-Day. Shortly after his glider landed, Lt Brotheridge was shot as he led the charge across Pegasus Bridge. His only daughter Margaret would be born 19 days later, but it wasn't until that same 40th anniversary that she discovered just what happened to him. All she knew while growing up was her father had died in the war, her mother remarried when she was aged four and didn't like to talk about it.   Speaking to the BBC in 2014, she said: ""I found out just before I was 40. I opened up the paper, and there was this big picture of my father's group and it had Brotheridge on it and I said, 'Oh my, just look at this.'""  On D-Day alone, as many as 4,400 Allied troops died, with some 9,000 wounded or missing. Total German casualties are estimated as being between 4,000 and 9,000 men. Thousands of French civilians also died, mainly as a result of bombing raids carried out by Allied forces.  The story of the airborne assault on Pegasus Bridge in the early hours of 6 June 1944 was immortalised in the 1962 film The Longest Day. Major Howard was played by the actor Richard Todd, who himself parachuted into Normandy on D-Day. Interviewed shortly before his death in 1999 aged 86, Major Howard laughed at how he was portrayed, describing it as sentimental rubbish.   -- For more stories and never-before-published radio scripts to your inbox, sign up to the In History newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.

6/6/2025,Article,News,Trump and Musk trade insults as row erupts in public view,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/c5yg98rl717o,"The rift between US President Donald Trump and his former adviser Elon Musk has erupted into the open, with each trading insults after the tech billionaire criticised one of Trump's key domestic policies.  The two billionaires escalated the feud throughout Thursday, lobbing barbs at each other on the social media sites they each own, suggesting a bitter conclusion to their unlikely alliance. The day began with Trump saying he was ""disappointed"" with Musk's criticisms of his administration's centrepiece tax and spending bill, musing that it may be the end of their ""great relationship"". Musk then accused Trump of ""ingratitude"", adding: ""Without me, Trump would have lost the election"". After hours of sparring, Trump appeared to downplay the situation. ""Oh it's okay,"" he told news site Politico. ""It's going very well, never done better."" His aides have scheduled a phone call with Musk for Friday, the same news site reported. Musk also appeared to believe there was a need to patch things up. Late on Thursday, in response to post by Bill Ackman, a prominent Trump backer, which suggested the pair needed to make peace, he wrote: ""You're not wrong"". The breaking point in the relationship between the president and his one-time ally came after weeks of Musk lobbying against Trump's ""big, beautiful"" spending bill, which was passed by the US House last month and is awaiting a vote in the Senate.  Shortly after leaving the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) after 129 days in the job, Musk took to his site X to call the bill a ""disgusting abomination"" and posting: ""Shame on those who voted for it: you know you did wrong.""  He argued that the bill will irresponsibly add to the US national debt, and encouraged his followers to phone their representatives to express opposition to the spending plan. Speaking to reporters during a news conference with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz on Thursday, Trump defending the bill and said: ""I'm very disappointed because Elon knew the inner workings of this bill better than almost anybody sitting here. All of a sudden he had a problem."" He went on to suggest that Musk was upset about the removal of subsidies and mandates for electric vehicles, which could affect his Tesla business. Musk denied this was the case and wrote: ""Keep the EV/solar incentive cuts in the bill, even though no oil & gas subsidies are touched (very unfair!!), but ditch the MOUNTAIN of DISGUSTING PORK in the bill."" ""Pork"" is a term used in US politics to describe wasteful government spending, particularly on things meant to curry favour with particular groups or local areas.  The partnership between the two men began when Musk endorsed Trump last July after an assassination attempt in Pennsylvania. The Tesla boss reportedly funnelled $290m (£213m) into getting him back into the White House. Amid a flurry of posts on X after Thursday's news conference, Musk took credit for the sweeping Republican victory in last November's election, writing: ""Without me, Trump would have lost the election, Dems would control the House and the Republicans would be 51-49 in the Senate."" ""Such ingratitude,"" he added. Musk went on to post a poll, asking his followers: ""Is it time to create a new political party in America that actually represents the 80% in the middle?""  Over the course of the day, Musk went on to repost a tweet calling for Trump to resign, argue that his global tariff plan will trigger a US recession, and to suggest without evidence that Trump appears in unreleased files related to late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.  Epstein was arrested in July 2019 on charges of sex trafficking and died by suicide while awaiting trial. Trump was president at the time. He said he knew Epstein ""like everybody in Palm Beach knew him"" but had a ""falling out with him a long time ago"".  The White House condemned Musk's allegation, with press secretary Karoline Leavitt saying in a statement: ""This is an unfortunate episode from Elon, who is unhappy with the One Big Beautiful Bill because it does not include the policies he wanted."" On his Truth Social network, Trump claimed that Musk ""just went CRAZY"" and went on to post: ""The easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon's Governmental Subsidies and Contracts. I was always surprised that Biden didn't do it!"" Musk's companies, including Tesla, SpaceX and Starlink have direct contacts with the US government and, like many other businesses, also benefit from subsidies and tax breaks. In response, Musk said SpaceX ""will begin decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft immediately"". The craft is used to shuttle people and supplies to the International Space Station.  However, he later he appeared to back down from that threat, saying in response to a post on X urging him to cool off: ""Ok, we won't decommission Dragon."" Telsa stock dropped by 14% within hours of the row bursting out into public.  According to the most recent analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the spending bill working its way through Congress will increase the US national debt by $2.4tn over 10 years and leave nearly 11 million people without government-backed health insurance. The White House disputes those figures, saying they don't account for revenues brought in by increased tariffs. Put in charge of radically slashing government spending at Doge, Musk initiated mass sackings and wholesale elimination of departments such as the US Agency for International Development (USAID). Doge claims to have saved $180bn, although that number has been disputed, and is well short of Musk's initial aim to cut spending by up to $2tn.

6/6/2025,Article,News,Former Zambian President Lungu dies aged 68,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/cn4gp07y3xmo,"Zambia's former President Edgar Lungu has died at the age of 68, his party has said in a statement. He had ""been receiving specialized treatment in South Africa"" for an undisclosed illness, the Patriotic Front (PF) added. Lungu led Zambia for six years from 2015, losing the 2021 election to the current President Hakainde Hichilema by a large margin. After that defeat he stepped back from politics but later returned to the fray. He had ambitions to vie for the presidency again but at the end of last year the Constitutional Court barred him from running, ruling that he had already served the maximum two terms allowed by law. Even after being disqualified from running once more for the presidency, he remained hugely influential in Zambian politics and did not hold back in his criticism of his successor. In a short video, Lungu's daughter Tasila said that the former head of state, who had been ""under medical supervision in recent weeks"", died at a clinic in South Africa's capital, Pretoria, at 06:00 (04:00 GMT) on Thursday. ""In this moment of grief, we invoke the spirit of 'One Zambia, One Nation' - the timeless creed that guided President Lungu's service to our country,"" she added in an emotional statement. There was no mention of what his condition was, but a decade ago he underwent throat surgery abroad. At the time his office said he was suffering from a narrowing of the oesophagus. In his condolence message, President Hichilema called for ""solemnity, unity and an outpouring of love and compassion. ""Let us come together as one people, above political affiliation or personal conviction, to honour the life of a man who once held the highest office in our land."" Cyril Ramaphosa, the president of South Africa, where Lungu was being treated, wrote that it was a ""privilege in recent weeks to care for a leader from our region whom we embraced as a brother and friend. We therefore share the grief and loss experienced."" Kenya's President William Ruto described Lungu as a ""progressive and outstanding leader who served the people of Zambia with zeal and commitment"". Lungu first became president in January 2015 after winning a special presidential election triggered by the death in office of Michael Sata. After completing Sata's term, he won a further five years in power in 2016 taking just over 50% of the vote. But after six years at the helm, Lungu, who encouraged Chinese investment and enlisted the country's help in infrastructure development, was blamed for a struggling economy, high unemployment and rising debt levels.  His time in office was also marred by corruption scandals involving his allies and relatives. Lungu always denied wrongdoing. His party's youth wing was accused of harassing opposition supporters, and the population at large. Lungu lost in 2021 by close to a million votes with Hichilema, seen as more pro-Western, tapping into widespread dissatisfaction among the electorate. He said he was retiring in the aftermath of the vote, but returned to frontline politics in 2023 as his successor's popularity waned. ""I am ready to fight from the front, not from the rear, in defence of democracy. Those who are ready for this fight, please come along with me, I am ready for anything,"" Mr Lungu told supporters at the time. After returning to politics, the former president complained of police harassment. At one point last year he said he was ""virtually under house arrest"". ""I cannot move out of my house without being accosted and challenged by the police and driving me back home"", Lungu told the BBC's Newsday programme. In the interview in May 2024, he alleged that he had been barred from attending a conference abroad and from travelling for medical treatment. In 2023, the police warned him against jogging in public, describing his weekly workouts as ""political activism"". The government said that Lungu had ""never been placed under house arrest"" and that he was free to exercise his rights. Lungu was a lawyer by training but enjoyed a meteoric rise in politics after winning a seat in parliament as a PF MP in 2011. He entered government as deputy minister in the vice-president's office in that year and rose to become minister of home affairs in just over 12 months. He later became minister of defence and then justice. A close friend described Lungu as a ""good foot-soldier, lawyer and politician, father, husband and grandparent"". Born on 11 November 1956, Lungu graduated with a law degree from the University of Zambia in 1981. He also underwent military training at the then Miltez army college in Kabwe. He later worked at Andre Masiye and Company Advocates, Barclays Bank and Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines.

6/6/2025,Article,Sport,'Genius' Yamal & all-time classic - why Spain are World Cup favourites,https://www.bbc.com//sport/football/articles/c9q0329d3xeo,"Lamine Yamal (centre) has scored six goals for Spain with one more game to come before he turns 18 Spain and France played out a Nations League semi-final game for the ages with a scoreline that looks like it belongs in a penalty shootout. The 5-4 win for Spain has everyone wondering if anyone can stop these attackers - although the less said about the defenders, the better. Spain, who play Portugal in Sunday's final, are looking for a third Uefa tournament success in a row having won the last Nations League and Euro 2024. And they are favourites for the World Cup coming up next summer, with France second on the list. Spain showed why they will be tough to stop after one of the most exciting international games in memory. A total of 40 shots, 17 on target, nine goals. Spain led 4-0 and 5-1 - and threatened to blow France away - before their rivals rallied. If only every match was like this. ""It was a crazy game,"" said Spain goalscorer Mikel Merino. ""Not the best game for the coaches - nobody wants to concede so many goals - but an amazing game for the fans."" His boss Luis de la Fuente seemed to actually disagree with him. ""I'm happy. I enjoy suffering! I don't understand sport without suffering,"" he said. ""When two great teams face off like today, it's normal every team makes the most of their moments."" Lamine Yamal, who turns 18 later this summer, scored twice for Spain to cement his credentials as a Ballon d'Or contender.  He is up to six goals for his country now, to add to 25 for club side Barcelona.  Yamal impressed more than France's Paris St-Germain stars - Ousmane Dembele and Desire Doue - who were hyped up pre-game after phenomenal club seasons. Les Bleus debutant Rayan Cherki helped spark France's fightback after coming off the bench to show why he is being linked with Liverpool and Manchester City. It would almost take too long to address everything that happened in the game. But here goes. Mikel Oyarzabal picked out Nico Williams to net Spain's opener, before also setting up Merino four minutes later. It was almost 3-0 but Dean Huijsen had a goal disallowed for offside after a sensational free-kick routine. ""That belongs in a musuem,"" said Prime Video summariser Karen Bardsley. After the break Yamal was fouled and scored the resulting penalty, with Williams finding Pedri shortly after for their fourth. Kylian Mbappe's penalty pulled one back, but Yamal bagged his second with a fine first touch and finish. ""It's hard to argue with the genius that you see before you,"" said Bardsley on seeing Yamal poke home his second. That was 5-1 but then France came back. Dembele hit the post, before debutant Cherki volleyed in from the edge of the box.  Dani Vivian turned a cross into his own net and then Randal Kolo Muani nodded in from Cherki's good ball. But they could not create another chance in the remaining two minutes of stoppage time to force the extra-time period every neutral wanted. After 75 minutes it looked as if the story was going to be about Spain blowing France away to cement their place as favourites to win everything going. They were the best side by some way at Euro 2024 and show no signs of slowing down. Wingers Yamal, who seems to improve with every game - which is actually to be expected at the age of 17 - and Williams were electric.  Midfielders Merino and Pedri were on the scoresheet. Oyarzabal had two assists to his name. Their oldest player was 28, and the team had an average age of 24. But there will be question marks about a defence that let in four goals - and a team who almost blew a 5-1 lead. Yamal said: ""When two great teams like this play, you sometimes see a lot of goals. They will make you suffer until the end but we went to the final despite the mistakes we made."" Unai Simon made six saves, so this was far from a story of an opponent who scored with every shot. ""That was a typical Spain performance,"" said Spanish journalist Guillem Balague. ""These players come out on the pitch with the feeling they can beat anyone. ""The interesting thing is they are doing it, winning and creating magic within a structure.  ""Spain have been playing in a way that represents the predominant model of our times. Not only are these players intelligent, creative but they are committed as well. They work so hard to get the ball back. ""Even though at the end Spain relaxed, when you do that you believe you belong to the right path.  ""You have special players all over the park and of course the feeling is more people are watching Spain because its really enjoyable and winning seems to be a habit."" Kylian Mbappe plays his club football in Spain for Real Madrid France's attackers were pretty decent. Even when they were getting whacked by Spain before the hour-mark, they were still having plenty of chances. They had more shots than Spain did in both halves - and more efforts on target in total. Mbappe, speaking to RTVE, said: ""We had some bursts of play we haven't had for a long time. But in just 10 minutes of the first half, we conceded two goals - and the same thing happened in the second half. ""We weren't consistent throughout the 90 minutes, but we did improve. It's not all negative."" PSG's two-goal Champions League final scorer Doue went close, team-mate and Ballon d'Or contender Dembele hit the post - and Mbappe had chances before scoring his penalty. But 21-year-old Lyon attacker Cherki had a big role after coming on. His sweet volley from the edge of the box was probably the best goal of the game - and his cross for Kolo Muani to make it 5-4 was inch-perfect. Again though, like Spain, it was the defending which was the issue. Juventus full-back Pierre Kalulu, making his debut on his 25th birthday, struggled. Clement Lenglet, winning his first cap since 2021, also faced problems too. ""I'm not here to point fingers but I have a backline who are used to working together,"" said boss Didier Deschamps. ""[This was] about finding another line who aren't used to playing together. I'm not going to give up on this defence. There were mitigating circumstances. But Spain have this capability to be very efficient. We were able to score goals too."" Sulaimon Adelekan: This Spain side is so good and young, they could rule world football for the next six years with Yamal, Pedri, Gavi and Nico Williams still yet to peak. They are dismantling and destroying France. Victor: With the way it's going, this Spanish team will easily win the next World Cup. There is simply no need traveling to USA. Robbie: Spain are the best team in the world at moment and it's not even close. Nick: Spain probably are currently the best team in the world, but a full-strength Germany (they were missing Rudiger, Musiala and Havertz yesterday) are close - they were the only team that can really claim they should have beaten Spain at the Euros with the chances they created - and Argentina are strong, too. I feel like France will be incredible at the next World Cup - they just need to work out what their best XI is, because they've arguably got too many good players! Copyright Â© 2025 BBC.

6/6/2025,Article,News,M&S hackers sent abuse and ransom demand directly to CEO,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/cr58pqjlnjlo,"The Marks & Spencer hackers sent an abuse-filled email directly to the retailer's boss gloating about what they had done and demanding payment, BBC News has learnt. The message to M&S CEO Stuart Machin - which was in broken English - was sent on the 23 April from the hacker group DragonForce using an employee email account. The email confirms for the first time that M&S has been hacked by the ransomware group – something that M&S has so far refused to acknowledge. ""We have marched the ways from China all the way to the UK and have mercilessly raped your company and encrypted all the servers,"" the hackers wrote. ""The dragon wants to speak to you so please head over to [our darknet website]."" The cyber attack has been hugely damaging for M&S, costing it an estimated £300m. More than six weeks on, it is still unable to take online orders The extortion email was shown to the BBC by a cyber-security expert. The message, which includes a racist term, was sent to the M&S CEO and seven other executives. As well as bragging about installing ransomware across the M&S IT system to render it useless, the hackers say they have stolen the private data of millions of customers. Nearly three weeks later customers were informed by the company that their data may have been stolen. The email was sent apparently using the account of an employee from the Indian IT giant Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) - which has provided IT services to M&S for over a decade. The Indian IT worker based in London has an M&S email address but is a paid TCS employee. It appears as though he himself was hacked in the attack. TCS has previously said it is investigating whether it was the gateway for the cyber-attack. The company has told the BBC that the email was not sent from its system and that it has nothing to do with the breach at M&S. M&S has declined to comment entirely. A darknet link shared in the extortion email connects to a portal for DragonForce victims to begin negotiating the ransom fee.  This is further indication that the email is authentic. Sharing the link – the hackers wrote: ""let's get the party started. Message us, we will make this fast and easy for us."" The criminals also appear to have details about the company's cyber-insurance policy too saying ""we know we can both help each other handsomely : ))"". The M&S CEO has refused to say if the company has paid a ransom to the hackers. DragonForce ended the email with an image of a dragon breathing fire. The email confirms for the first time the link between M&S's hack and the ongoing Co-op cyber-attack, which DragonForce have also claimed responsibility for. The two hacks - which began in late April - have wrought havoc on the two retailers. Some Co-op shelves were left bare for weeks, while M&S expects its operations to be disrupted until July. Although we now know that DragonForce is behind both, it is still not clear who the actual hackers are. DragonForce offers cyber-criminal affiliates various services on their darknet site in exchange for a 20% cut of any ransoms collected. Anyone can sign up and use their malicious software to scramble a victim's data or use their darknet website for their public extortion. Nothing has appeared on the criminal's darknet leak site about either Co-op or M&S but the hackers told the BBC last week that they were having IT issues of their own and would be posting information ""very soon."" Some researchers say DragonForce are based in Malaysia, while others say Russia. Their email to M&S implies that they are from China. Speculation has been mounting that a loose collective of young western hackers known as Scattered Spider might be the affiliates behind the hacks and also one on Harrods. Scattered Spider is not really a group in the normal sense of the word. It's more of a community which organises across sites like Discord, Telegram and forums – hence the description ""scattered"" which was given to them by cyber-security researchers at CrowdStrike. Some Scattered Spider hackers are known to be teenagers in the US and UK. The UK's National Crime Agency said in a BBC documentary about the retail hacks, that they are focusing investigations on the group. The BBC spoke to the Co-op hackers who declined to answer whether or not they were Scattered Spider. ""We won't answer that question"" is all they said. Two of them said they wanted to be known as ""Raymond Reddington"" and ""Dembe Zuma"" after characters from US crime thriller The Blacklist which involves a wanted criminal helping police take down other criminals on a blacklist. In a message to me, they boasted: ""We're putting UK retailers on the Blacklist."" There have been a series of smaller cyber-attacks on UK retailers since but none as impactful of disruptive as those on Co-op, M&S and Harrods. In the early stages of the M&S hack, unknown sources told cyber news site Bleeping Computer that evidence is pointing to Scattered Spider. The UK's national cyber-crime unit has confirmed to the BBC that the group is one of their key suspects. As for the hackers I spoke to on Telegram, they declined to answer whether or not they were Scattered Spider. ""We won't answer that question"" is all they said.

6/6/2025,Article,News,Arrests made in crackdown on finfluencers,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/crljw8n78l1o,"Hundreds of social media posts and websites operated by financial influencers are to be taken down following action by the City regulator. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said the move was part of an international crackdown, which has led to three arrests in the UK. So-called finfluencers can legitimately give financial tips on social media to large audiences, but sometimes this can stray into illegal financial advice. That can include a lack of authorisation and a failure to explain the risks - all packaged in promotional posts using the pretence of a lavish lifestyle. Regulators across across the UK, Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, Italy and the United Arab Emirates were involved in the crackdown during the week. The FCA said that, in the UK, it resulted in 650 requests for deletions from social media, and 50 take downs of websites operated by unauthorised finfluencers. It has also sent seven ""cease and desist"" letters, and invited four finfluencers for interview. Steve Smart, from the FCA, said: ""Our message to finfluencers is loud and clear. They must act responsibly and only promote financial products where they are authorised to do so - or face the consequences."" There are strict rules surrounding authorisation requirements for financial promotions in the UK. In some cases these are flouted, according to Beth Harris, head of financial crime at the FCA. ""The typical thing you may see is that somebody with a large social media presence will be on a beach in a sunny location with some super cars behind them, and wearing designer clothes and basically trying to sell a lifestyle,"" she told the BBC's Today programme.  ""Often they'll say they have super algorithms that means that they are a wonderful trader, so that then you can pay a fee, and then they will send you their trade."" However, to do this, she said, ""you must be authorised"". The FCA can request that social media platforms take down certain content, but the regulator has no powers to enforce them to do so. It called on these platforms to act on its requests quicker. The plea comes as the Treasury Committee has written to the technology company Meta - the owner of Facebook and Instagram - questioning its response to this kind of harmful content. The committee has asked Meta to set out to it why ""it has taken you on occasion up to six weeks to respond to a takedown request from the Financial Conduct Authority?"" A statement from Meta regarding the committee's letter said: ""There was an isolated incident in late 2024 which resulted in a delay in actioning a small number of reports from the FCA. This was rectified and all other relevant reports made by the FCA have been promptly processed."" On Tuesday, the MPs on Treasury Committee will quiz the chief executive of the FCA, Nikhil Rathi, on moves to bring more cryptoasset activity into regulation. On Friday, the regulator said it was proposing to lift the ban on offering crypto exchange traded notes to retail investors. This would allow individual investors to put money into products that track the value of crypto. The ban has been in place since 2021. Copyright 2025 BBC.

6/6/2025,Article,News,Measles holiday warning as cases rise in Europe,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/c706y4jr95lo,"Families travelling abroad this summer on holiday or to visit relatives are being warned about the rise in measles cases in Europe and other regions. Measles infections in Europe are at a 25-year high, while cases are also surging in countries such as Pakistan and Nigeria. Childhood vaccination rates in the UK that offer protection against measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) are still a long way below the recommended 95% uptake, with the lowest regional rates found in London at just over 73% vaccinated. The UK Health Security Agency is warning holidaymakers to make sure they are up to date with their vaccinations and stress that it is never too late to get vaccinated. The UKHSA's latest data on measles infections shows that an outbreak is continuing in England. Some 109 cases were confirmed in April and 86 so far in May. These cases have mostly been in unvaccinated children aged 10 years and under.  London has reported almost half of all cases in the past four weeks. Dr Vanessa Saliba, consultant epidemiologist at the UK Health Security Agency, says the rise in cases in England reflects what is happening abroad - and that's a concern as the summer holiday season gets going.  ""It's essential that everyone, particularly parents of young children, check all family members are up to date with two MMR doses, especially if you are travelling this summer for holidays or visiting family,"" Dr Saliba said. ""Measles cases are picking up again in England and outbreaks are happening in Europe and many countries with close links to the UK."" Measles spreads very easily and can be a nasty disease, leading to complications like ear and chest infections and inflammation of the brain with some children tragically ending up in hospital and suffering life-long consequences, Dr Saliba added. ""Nobody wants this for their child and it's not something you want to experience when away on holiday."" The decline in vaccination rates in the UK - particularly since the Covid pandemic - has been mirrored in other countries, especially in Europe.  The World Health Organization and UNICEF reported 127,350 measles cases in the European Region in 2024 - double the number of cases reported during the previous year and the highest number since 1997. This year has seen outbreaks in several other European countries popular with UK holidaymakers, including France, Italy, Spain and Germany. The WHO has also reported that Romania, Pakistan, India, Thailand, Indonesia and Nigeria currently have among the largest number of measles cases worldwide. There has been a big push to improve MMR vaccination rates across the UK, but Dr Amanda Doyle, national director for primary care and community services at NHS England, says there is still a lot of work to do. ""Too many babies and young children are still not protected against the diseases, which are contagious infections that spread very easily and can cause serious health problems.  ""MMR jabs are provided free as part of the NHS routine immunisation programme – and I would encourage all parents to act on invites or check vaccination records if they think they may have missed their child's vaccination."" Health experts say that anyone, whatever their age, who has not had two doses of the MMR vaccine can contact their GP surgery to book an appointment and that it is never too late to catch up. Measles is a highly contagious disease which is spread by coughs and sneezes. Common symptoms include: Small white spots may appear inside the mouth. A blotchy red or brown rash usually appears after a few days, typically on the face and behind the ears, before spreading to the rest of the body. It can be harder to see on brown and black skin. Measles normally clears up within seven to 10 days. However, it can lead to pneumonia, meningitis, blindness and seizures. Babies and young children, pregnant women and those with a weakened immune system are at increased risk. Getting it while pregnant can lead to stillbirth, miscarriage or babies being born small. Measles can be fatal, but this is rare. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.  The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites. Read about our approach to external linking.  "
6/6/2025,Article,News,Lost Turner oil painting found after 150 years,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/clyzp4r70m8o,"Turner's first ever exhibited oil painting is to be put up for auction after being lost for more 150 years. The Rising Squall, features a dramatic view of a former hot spring and spa in Bristol seen from east bank of the River Avon, before Clifton Suspension Bridge was built.  It made its way around the world and returned to the UK but was unknown as a Turner masterpiece for more than a century. His signature was revealed after the painting was cleaned last year. The artwork will be displayed in a public exhibition at Sotheby's, in London, between 28 June and 1 July before it is auctioned with an estimated value of up to £300,000. Julian Gascoigne, Sotheby's senior specialist, said: ""It's a fascinating and very instructive insight into his early style."" He added the painting represents Turner, famed as a watercolourist, as a teenage artist with ""ambition and skill"" in his early experiments an oil painter. The painting made its debut at the Royal Academy in 1793, three days after Turner's 18th birthday, before being bought by Reverend Robert Nixon, a customer of his father's barber shop. Reverend Nixon's son inherited the painting after his death, Mr Gascoigne said, adding it then fell ""into obscurity"" having last been exhibited in Tasmania, Australia, in 1858. The painting was done as part of Turner's first artistic tour when he was a teenager, where he travelled from London to the West Country. Mr Gascoigne said: ""Bristol would have been a very natural place for a young artist based in London to get to relatively easily and relatively cheaply, but would provide him with the sort of dramatic, sublime, picturesque landscape that he was seeking."" There was early mention of the painting in obituaries of Turner's life but for at least a century it was mistaken for a watercolour, meaning it was missing from the catalogue of his exhibited oil paintings. Up until the discovery last year during a restoration project, experts believed Turner's earliest exhibited oil was the Fisherman at Sea painting. Follow BBC Bristol on Facebook, X and Instagram.

6/6/2025,Article,Culture,Five works that reveal Banksy's hidden philosophy,https://www.bbc.com//culture/article/20250602-five-works-that-reveal-the-philosophy-of-banksy,"Banksy's new mural in Marseille is not the first image he has connected to the history of ideas. From Plato to Foucault, a Banksy expert reveals the philosophy behind these popular artworks. Which is the real you, the person you are now or the one you are capable of becoming? It's a heady question, to be sure, and not one you would expect to be confronted with while strolling down a street in Marseille in the waning days of May. Yet it's precisely the existential dilemma that Banksy, who once asserted ""being yourself is overrated"" – has surreptitiously installed in a cloistered stretch of the quiet Rue Félix Fregier, the site of a new work – the latest installment in the elusive artist's decades-long career as a provocative philosophical prankster.  For more than 30 years, Banksy has spiked many of his most iconic works – from his girl reaching hopelessly for a heart-shaped balloon to his masked rioter hurling a bouquet of flowers – with barbed allusions to Old Masters, from Michelangelo to Monet, Vermeer to Van Gogh. But there's more. Beneath his stealthy stencils lies a deep and deliberate engagement with the history of ideas as well, from classical Stoicism to postmodern deconstructionism. On 29 May, Banksy posted on Instagram a photo of his first new piece in more than five months, piquing the internet's interest by withholding its precise location. Discovered shortly thereafter in the major port city in southern France, Marseille, the mural is, at first glance, deceptively simple: a tall silhouette of a lighthouse spray-painted on to a blank beige urban wall; a rusting street bollard positioned nearby; and a painted shadow stretching across the pavement, joining the real-world object to its augmented, if two-dimensional, echo. Stencilled across the black lighthouse are the words: ""I want to be what you saw in me.""  Anyone keen to find a source for the ideas that inform Banksy's new work needs merely to flip open any history of philosophy to Plato's seminal allegory of the cave (from the Fourth-Century BC treatise The Republic), then flip the ancient metaphor on its head. In Plato's parable, prisoners chained inside a cave mistake shadows on the wall for reality, unaware of the truer forms that cast them outside. But here, Banksy, being Banksy, baits us by switching the set-up, reversing the relationship between essence and shadow. In Banksy's mural, the drab bollard casts not a diminished imitation of itself, but something far grander – a lighthouse, a symbol of illumination and guidance. Here, it's the silhouette, not reality, that's true. Banksy's inversion urges us to ask where reality really resides: in what is, or in what might be? His poignant phrase – ""I want to be what you saw in me"" – is alluringly elastic. Is this the bollard dreaming of being more than it appears? Or the shadow wishing to become light? Or is it all of us – Banksy included – struggling to live up to the better versions imagined by those who believe in us? The answer is surely yes to all of the above. And it's a yes too to the question: 'is this new work a lamp capable of shining light on further levels of meaning in Banksy?' What follows is a brief look back at some of the artist's best-known works and how they too are invigorated by, and often upend, many of the most important philosophical tenets – both social and intellectual – that underwrite who we are and who we might be. Banksy's new mural in Marseille is not the first to be accompanied by an affecting caption connecting the piece to the history of ideas. Among his most famous murals, Girl with Balloon, which portrays a child reaching towards a heart-shaped balloon drifting away from her, first appeared in 2002 in various locations in London, including on the South Bank, alongside the consoling assertion, ""there is always hope"". That conviction, which fuels the ceaseless striving for an ideal that is seemingly unobtainable in the mural (there's no way that balloon is coming back) rhymes richly with aspects of 19th-Century German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer's ideas concerning an unquenchable and irrational ""Will"" as a fundamental force that drives humanity. When, years later, Banksy mischievously concealed a remote-controlled shredder in the frame of a version of Girl with Balloon that came up for auction in 2018, and sensationally destroyed the work before the eyes of aghast auction-goers, he succeeded in upping the ante on Schopenhauer's belief in the futility of desire by boldly manifesting it himself. Where there's a will there's a fray. Banksy's famous mural of a masked man frozen forever in the instant before he unleashes not a brick or a bomb but a bouquet of flowers may seem, at first blush, to exemplify a pacifist's commitment to peaceful disobedience. The work appears to echo the precepts of Mahatma Gandhi's Satyagraha – a philosophy of non-violence that the Indian ethicist coined in 1919. Banksy's fully flexed figure, incongruously armed with a fistful of beauty, appears to epitomise Gandhi's insistence on wielding moral, not physical, strength. Doesn't it? Or has Banksy slyly subverted the philosophical assertion of pacifistic force by portraying his hero as an enraged rioter? The figure's anger has not been tempered by an appeal to the higher ideals of beauty and truth. Instead, those ideals have been weaponised by Banksy. Here, beauty and truth are not disarming, they are devastatingly explosive. Banksy's mural in Marseille employs a tried-and-true technique to ensure the work protrudes into the urban space in which we'll encounter it – elevating its philosophical potential from something flimsy and flat to something undeniably urgent. It's a tactic he used in a 2007 work that appeared near London's Oxford Street in which he depicts a boy atop a precariously high ladder, spray-painting the penetrating observation that we are ""One Nation Under CCTV"" in outlandishly outsized letters. Also portrayed within the mural is a uniformed officer and his obedient police dog who surveil the young vandal, while above them all an actual CCTV camera, presumably recording everything, juts out from the wall. The endless layers of surveillance-within-surveillance to which the work attests – as we watch the state watch an officer watch the boy – captures with uncanny precision the philosophical contours of the vast and all-encompassing prison machine in which the French poststructural philosopher Michel Foucault believed everyone in society was now irredeemably enmeshed. In Foucault's study Discipline and Punish: The Birth of the Prison, he resuscitates a blueprint for a prison proposed by the British utilitarian philosopher Jeremy Bentham at the end of the 18th Century, ""The Panopticon"" (meaning ""all seeing""), and uses it as a menacing metaphor for how no one can escape the perniciously penetrating eye of the panoptical state.  Banksy's witty 2014 work Mobile Lovers shines a chilling light on the state of contemporary relationships. The mural depicts a couple whose almost affectionate embrace is interrupted by the deeper fondness they have for the warm glow of their smartphones. The French existentialist philosopher Simone de Beauvoir, who died in 1986, may not have lived long enough to witness the emergence of mobiles. Yet her profoundly influential 1947 book The Ethics of Ambiguity – published exactly 60 years before the iPhone was launched in 2007 – with its exploration of the devastation that detachment and disconnection can wreak on the realisation of our truest selves, is profoundly proleptic of our modern predicament. To be free, de Beauvoir insisted, requires a deep attentiveness to each other. She believed in the authenticity of human encounters, without which life is a futile performance, dimly lit by disposable devices, rather than something profound and meaningful.  How Banksy Saved Art History by Kelly Grovier, published by Thames & Hudson, is out now. -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.

6/6/2025,Article,Travel,How WW2 changed the French diet,https://www.bbc.com//travel/article/20250605-how-world-war-two-changed-the-french-diet,"More than 80 years after D-Day, the recipes and ingredients introduced during France's wartime occupation are slowly making a comeback. By June 1940, German forces had blitzed through France in just six weeks, leading more than half of the country to be occupied. As a result, French staples like cheese, bread and meat were soon rationed, and by 1942 some citizens were living on as few as 1,110 calories per day. Even after World War Two ended in 1945, access to food in France would continue to be regulated by the government until 1949. Such austerity certainly had an impact on how the French ate during and just after the war. Yet, more than 80 years after Allied forces landed in Normandy to begin liberating the nation on D-Day (6 June 1944), few visitors realise that France's wartime occupation still echoes across the nation's culinary landscape. In the decades following WW2, the French abandoned the staples that had got them through the tough times of occupation; familiar ingredients like root vegetables and even hearty pain de campagne (country bread) were so eschewed they were nearly forgotten. But as wartime associations have slowly faded from memory, a bevy of younger chefs and tastemakers are reviving the foods that once kept the French alive. There aren't many French residents old enough to vividly recall life in wartime France today, and fewer still would deign to discuss it. Author Kitty Morse only discovered her great-grandparents' ""Occupation diary and recipe book"" after her own mother's death. Morse released them in 2022 in her book Bitter Sweet: A Wartime Journal and Heirloom Recipes from Occupied France. ""My mother never said any of this to me,"" she said. BBC.com's World's Table ""smashes the kitchen ceiling"" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future. Aline Pla was just nine years old in 1945 but, raised by small-town grocers in the south of France, she remembers more than others might. ""You were only allowed a few grams of bread a day,"" she recalled. ""Some [people] stopped smoking – especially those with kids. They preferred trading for food."" Such widespread lack gave rise to ersatz replacements: saccharine stood in for sugar; butter was supplanted by lard or margarine; and instead of coffee, people brewed roots or grains, like acorns, chickpeas or the barley Pla recalls villagers roasting at home. While many of these wartime brews faded from fashion, chicory coffee remained a staple, at least in northern France. Ricoré – a blend of chicory and instant coffee – has been on supermarket shelves since the 1950s. More recently, brands like Cherico are reimagining it for a new generation, marketing it as a climate-conscious, healthful alternative traditional coffee. According to Patrick Rambourg, French culinary historian and author of Histoire de la Cuisine et de la Gastronomie Françaises, if chicory never wholly disappeared in France, it's in large part thanks to its flavour. ""Chicory tastes good,"" he explained. ""It doesn't necessarily make you think of periods of austerity."" Other products did, however, such as swedes and Jerusalem artichokes, which WW2 historian Fabrice Grenard asserted ""were more reserved for animals before the war."" The French were nevertheless forced to rely heavily on them once potato rationing began in November 1940, and after the war, these vegetables became almost ""taboo"", according to Rambourg. ""My mother never cooked a swede in her life,"" added Morse. Two generations later, however, Jerusalem artichokes, in particular, have surged to near-omnipresence in Paris, from the trendy small plates at Belleville wine bar Paloma to the classic chalkboard menu at bistro Le Bon Georges. Alongside parsnips, turnips and swedes, they're often self-awarely called ""les legumes oubliés""(""the forgotten vegetables"") and, according to Léo Giorgis, chef-owner of L'Almanach Montmartre, French chefs have been remembering them for about 15 years.  ""Now you see Jerusalem artichokes everywhere, [as well as] swedes [and] golden turnips,"" he said. As a chef dedicated to seasonal produce, Giorgis finds their return inspiring, especially in winter. ""Without them, we're kind of stuck with cabbages and butternut squash."" According to Apollonia Poilâne, the third generation of her family to run the eponymous bakery Poilâne, founded in 1932, a similar shift took place with French bread. Before the war, she explained, white baguettes, which weren't subject to the same imposed prices as sourdough, surged to popularity on a marketplace rife with competition.  But in August 1940, bread was one of the first products to be rationed, and soon, white bread was supplanted by darker-crumbed iterations bulked out with bran, chestnut, potato or buckwheat. The sale of fresh bread was forbidden by law, which some say was implemented specifically to reduce bread's palatability. ""I never knew white bread!"" said Pla. When one went to eat at a friend's home during wartime, she recalled, ""You brought your bread – your bread ration. Your own piece of bread.""  Hunger for white bread surged post-war – so much so that while Poilâne's founder, Pierre Poilâne, persisted in producing the sourdoughs he so loved, his refusal to bake more modern loaves saw him ejected from bakery syndicates, according to his granddaughter, Apollonia. These days, however, the trend has come full circle: Baguette consumption fell 25% from 2015 to 2025, but the popularity of so-called ""special"" breads made with whole or heirloom grains is on the rise. ""It's not bad that we're getting back to breads that are a bit less white,"" said Pla. For Grenard, however, the most lasting impact the war left on French food culture was a no-waste mindset. ""What remains after the war is more of a state of mind than culinary practices,"" he said. Rambourg agreed: ""You know the value of food when you don't have any."" The French were forced to get creative with what they had. In France's south-eastern Ardèche department, Clément Faugier rebranded its sweetened chestnut paste as Génovitine, a name whose medical consonance made it easier to market as a fortifier and even prescribe. In the coastal Camargue region, local samphire suddenly stood in for green beans. Morse's great-grandfather foraged for wild mushrooms in the nearby Vosges mountains, and in cities, those with balconies planted their window boxes with carrots or leeks. Paris' public Jardin des Tuileries was even transformed into collective kitchen gardens. According to Rambourg, this subsistence mindset ""would affect the entire generation that lived through the war, and our parents, because they were the children of our grandparents, who knew the war."" More like this: • How French winemakers outwitted the Nazis • The top-secret meeting that helped win D-Day • The French cocktail born from a banned spirit As the need for these subsistence methods dissipated, French cuisine underwent another period of change. In 1963, the country welcomed its first Carrefour hypermarket, and large-scale supermarkets soon supplanted small shops. According to Grenard, this was partly due to ""suspicion"" following corruption during the German occupation, when some grocers inflated prices far past the norm, just because they could . ""At the end of the war, consumers held real rancour against small shopkeepers,"" said Grenard. ""In a supermarket, the prices are fixed.""  Fast-forward eight decades, and some locals, now motivated by climate change are turning back to small, local grocers, such as the locavore Terroir d’Avenir shops dotting Paris. Others are reaching into the nation's past to resuscitate techniques like canning, preserving and foraging that saved many French residents during the war, according to Grenard. ""The people that got by the best were the ones who had reserves."" Today, filling the larder with foraged food has become popular once again. In Kaysersberg, Alsace, chef Jérôme Jaegle of Alchémille puts this ancestral knowledge centre-stage by offering wild harvesting workshops culminating in a multi-course meal. And in Milly-la-Forêt, just outside Paris, François Thévenon highlights the foraging techniques he learned from his grandmother with classes teaching others how to seek out these edible plants themselves. ""After the war"", he explained, ""people wanted to reassure themselves that they wouldn't lack anything anymore."" They turned, he said, to overconsumption, specifically of meat, which even his foraging grandmother ate every day, at every meal. ""You often hear when you ask older folk why they no longer eat wild plants, that it's because they don't have to,"" Thévenon said, who forages for wild plants because he believes it's good for his health and that of the planet. According to Apollonia, the war didn't only change how France eats. ""It probably changed the way the world eats,"" she asserted. Today, the techniques and philosophies that helped the French survive are slowly coming back to life. -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.  For more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.   Copyright 2025 BBC.

6/6/2025,Article,Travel,Eight rare juices you can only try in the Amazon,https://www.bbc.com//travel/article/20250529-eight-rare-juices-you-can-only-try-in-the-amazon,"Far from smoothie bars and powdered sachets, these wild Amazonian juices are pulped just hours after picking – making them rich in flavour and cultural meaning. The Amazon is not only the world's largest and most biodiverse ecosystem – it's also one of the most delicious. Among the thousands of native species, around 220 trees are known to bear edible fruit, many of which never leave the jungle. Some are too delicate to export, while others are little known beyond the communities that have nurtured them for generations. But along the Amazon River and its tributaries – from Peru's misty highland jungle to the floodplains of northern Brazil – travellers can find market stalls and cafe counters brimming with thick, vibrant juices that capture the flavour of the forest. These are the fruits you're unlikely to find bottled or powdered at home, often pulped just hours after harvest, served chilled in the tropical heat and prized not only for their nutrients but for their rich textures and sharp tangs. Here are eight juices worth seeking out, whether for their bold flavours, cultural significance or the thrill of trying something new. On the eastern slopes of the Andes, where rivers cascade in dramatic waterfalls into the Amazon Basin, travellers will find the aguaje fruit of the Moriche palm. In the small Peruvian city of Tingo Maria, markets are piled high with silver trays of the armadillo-like fruit. Locals soak them in water for a day or two, before peeling the brown armour to reveal an intensely orange flesh. The pulp is soaked, mashed and transformed into aguajina – a thick and custardy drink that tastes like cross between pumpkin pie and flan. BBC.com's World's Table ""smashes the kitchen ceiling"" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future. Some locals say that the fruit contains oestrogen compounds and men should be careful of drinking too much of it, though there is little scientific evidence. ""The aguajina is very useful – for the bone, for the skin, for the complexion – especially for women,"" says Gianina Pujay, an aguajinera who sells the drink across from Tingo Maria's fruit market. In the same region, the cocona fruit, a tropical relative of the common tomato, yields a tangy juice that tastes like a pineapple-papaya hybrid with a thick, almost oily body.  ""Many Amazonian fruits are consumed in juice form because their pulp is acidic, fibrous or difficult to eat raw, like the cocona,"" explains Miluska Carrasco, a researcher and nutritionist at Peru's Instituto de Investigación Nutricional, ""It's also a practical way to use them quickly before they spoil."" Descending from the verdant slopes of the Andes into the Amazon Basin, the rivers slow down and transform into thoroughfares of commercial activity. On the banks of the Ucayali River is the river port city of Pucallpa, the furthest Peru's road system will take you into the centre of the Amazon. Here, where container barges, passenger ships and canoes all move goods around the forest, camu camu is a must-drink juice.  The small, tart, plum-like fruit tastes like a sour strawberry with a hint of peach, and is a favourite of local juice vendors. ""[It] has more vitamin C than oranges,"" says Carrasco, ""[as well as] other bioactive compounds."" Where a navel orange provides about 6mg of vitamin C per 100g, the camu camu contains more than 2,000mg for the same amount of flesh.  The season for camu camu is short, however, typically between January and March, so take advantage of the fresh juice when it's available. Locals also eat the little plums with salt; just spit out the seeds.  In the heart of Brazil's vast Amazonas state, 700 miles east of Pucallpa as the toucan flies (and at least a week or more on a river boat), tucumã palms provide an orange fruit that's only in season from February to August. During this time, it's often eaten for breakfast with cassava flour and is a key ingredient in the state's signature x-caboquinho sandwich, where slices are layered with salty coalho cheese and sweet chunks of fried plantains. To make juice from the notoriously fibrous tucumã, vendors use peelers, blenders and sieves to reduce shavings of the fruit to a pulp and then filter out the lightly nutty liquid. According to Francisco Falcão, a farmer in the community of Bom Jesus in the Tefé National Forest, ""people say that tucumã is good to eat and improves sight and skin"". Indeed, the fruit is rich in both manganese and calcium. Where kiwi, which is relatively high in calcium, contains around 30mg of calcium per 100g, tucumã has been measured to contain around four times as much. Also in the Tefé region, ""there's a palm tree that people eat the fruit of,"" says Falcão. ""Pupunha is a plant that we harvest starting in December and ending February."" Spanish-speaking parts of the Amazon know this oily palm fruit as pejibaye or pijuayo, and it is a key source of natural fats as well as vitamin B1 and vitamin E.   The pupunha grow in clusters of orange and red acorn-shaped fruit. They cannot be eaten raw, but once boiled they make a filling snack akin to an oily sweet potato. The boiled fruits also produce a creamy orange juice once fully pulped. In Peru, forest communities ferment the pulp into a lightly alcoholic drink called chicha or masato – especially during times of harvest.    In Manaus, capital of the Amazonas, reliable refrigeration means locals and visitors can enjoy fruits in various forms. The thick shell of the cupuaçu contains a collection of seeds surrounded by a fleshy white pulp. That pulp can be transformed into silky, tangy juice. But lately, locals have been incorporating its juice into ice cream. Indeed, the rest of Brazil is catching on, with ice cream parlours in Rio de Janeiro now offering the flavour too. More like this: • Spain's 'white gold' super-drink • A decadent avocado smoothie to break the Ramadan fast • The Caribbean's cooling, healthy elixir for summer Cupuaçu tastes like a creamy pineapple – surprising given that it's a close relative of cacao. ""It's the same genus as cacao and people make cupulate [as opposed to chocolate from it],"" says Daniel Tregidgo, a researcher at Brazil's Mamirauá Institute for Sustainable Development. ""When you go to the markets there are huge piles of cupuaçu seeds. I look at that and I say that's hipster chocolate right there."" Why haven’t we heard of cupulate yet? In Tregidgo's opinion, ""It's a matter of investment. If you take something from the middle of Amazon and you try to get it out into the global market without being exploitative, it is a bit tricky."" Bars produced from cupuaçu have the flavour of chocolate but retain some of their citrus piquancy. In the Amazon delta, jenipapo is known for its traditional use as a blue dye and a temporary tattoo ink. The fruit itself, which grows all along Brazil's coast in addition to the Amazon, has a yellowish pulp that's a great source of vitamin B1 and zinc. While jenipapo can be consumed as a fresh juice that tastes a bit like dried apricots, try ordering licor de jenipapo, an infused cachaça liqueur served in small bars and botecos. While açaí has become a global wellness trend, the version served in the Amazon bears little resemblance to the frozen bowls found abroad. What many travellers don't realise is that there are seven distinct açaí palm species. Locals distinguish between açaí-do-Pará, açaí-do-mato and juçara, depending on region. In Belém, for example, vendors use pneumatic presses to extract the berry's thick, purplish pulp – sold in clear bags and consumed straight out of bowls with spoons, as if a purple gazpacho. Outside of its natural range in Brazil, the rest of the country enjoys the pulp prepared in yogurts and ice creams.  -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.  For more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.  Copyright 2025 BBC.

6/6/2025,Article,Future,The abandoned US quest to control hurricanes,https://www.bbc.com//future/article/20250603-project-stormfury-the-us-quest-to-control-hurricanes,"An ambitious project to weaken or divert hurricanes generated decades of suspicion and disagreement. What did we learn – and will it ever be revived? As a grad student in the 1960s, Joe Golden flew on about a dozen of missions into the ""eyewall"" of a hurricane, where winds of 160mph (260km/h) battered the sides of his propeller-powered plane. ""You could think of it as a ring of thunderstorms that often tower over 40,000ft [12,200m],"" says Golden, who photographed hurricanes and gathered data on their development. ""And it can also have frequent lightning in it,"" he adds, matter-of-factly. ""So that's another hazard."" Crews on the ""hurricane hunting"" flights padded their planes' cabin and learned to never ignore orders to strap in when penetrating the wall. But meteorologist Hugh Willoughby recalls thrilling ""white-knuckle"" flights, including one when life rafts and safety equipment crashed against the ceiling when the plane began falling about 200ft (60m), its engine flaming out. ""This is something I dearly loved: get up at 2:00 in the morning, put on my flight suit, lace up my boots,"" says Willoughby. ""Go into the kids' room, pull the covers up over them, kiss them on the forehead, and go out and fly into a raging tempest."" Since the 1940s, pioneers like Willoughby and Golden have been embarking on daring flights into this most intense region of a hurricane to gather data that has expanded scientific knowledge about them and revealed how they develop their lethal force. But, for a brief window of a few decades, the US Department of Defense and weather services flew missions into the eyewall with an even more ambitious objective: to not only observe these towering storms but to change them. Between 1962 and 1983, under the name Project Stormfury, navy pilots flew missions that released a silver compound into ""the belt of maximum winds"", just beyond the wall, in the belief that this region was violent but unstable. If so, perhaps it could be disrupted, calming the storm's vicious force. Six decades after its first flights – and 42 years since it was cancelled – Stormfury veterans Golden and Willoughby remember a project that gave us vital knowledge that has helped to save lives. But along with this, US attempts to control storms have left behind a controversial legacy that has fueled distrust and conspiracy theories, with some unanswered questions that linger today. Both Golden and Willoughby recall that weather modification projects emerged at a time of enormous optimism following the end of World War Two, when there was a widespread perception that there was no limit to what science could achieve. In the background was the nuclear bomb, says Kristine Harper, professor of history and sciences at the University of Copenhagen. After the destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, there was expectation that constructive uses of atomic energy would follow, from nuclear power to ""atomic gardening"" that used radioactive substances to breed new mutant crops. In 1946, newspaper and radio stations speculated that nuclear weapons might soon safeguard us from acts of God, recounts Harper in her book Make It Rain, an account of the US government's attempts at weather control. One New York Times article asked whether atomic energy ""by its explosive force"" could divert hurricanes away from cities. ""You know, maybe we could destroy hurricanes with nuclear bombs?"" laughs Harper. (This is not a good idea, meteorologists have repeatedly clarified.) Early efforts to explore weather control were backed by veterans of the Manhattan Project, including John von Neumann and the so-called ""father of the H-bomb"" Edward Teller. But the most important breakthrough arrived, instead, inside a small, adapted freezer. At the research laboratory at US firm General Electric run by Nobel Prize-winning chemist Irving Langmuir, experiments had shown it might be possible to induce rain in clouds, by releasing substances  that would cause supercooled water in the clouds to crystallise into snowflakes.  To test this ""cloud seeding"" technology in the field, Langmuir's assistant dropped dry ice out of the window of a single-engine airplane into a cloud hanging over western Massachusetts in November 1946. Langmuir was watching through binoculars from the ground below as snow began to fall in autumn toward a mountain called Mount Greylock. ""This is history!"" he cried down the phone to reporters, according to Caesar's Last Breath: The Epic Story of the Air Around Us by Sam Kean. At a time when many dreamed they might soon ""be able to choose their weather much as they chose a radio station"", writes Harper, the era of weather control appeared to be startlingly close at hand.  Although little was known at the time about hurricane structure and behaviour, the US Navy and Army agreed to collaborate with Langmuir's lab on Project Cirrus, which aimed to understand if cloud seeding technology might be able to help extinguish hurricanes at birth, divert them off-course, or else weaken deadly tropical cyclones before they hit land. Data gathered by weather balloons and aircraft indicated that hurricane clouds might contain large quantities of supercooled water, like the cloud Langmuir had seeded. During the hurricane season of 1947, on October 13, he convinced a navy crew to drop 80kg (200lb) of dry ice into an ice crusher in the belly of a B-17 bomber, sprinkling powder into a hurricane crossing Florida. This would be the historic first attempt to use this technology to modify a tropical cyclone. Although the adapted World War Two bombers did not have the technology to precisely target areas of the hurricane, their mission was enough to encourage the project's directors. Flying in a B-17 half-a-mile behind the seeding plane, a US Navy meteorologist observed overcast clouds turned into snowfall, noting the hurricane appeared to undergo ""pronounced modification"", recounts Fixing The Sky by Jim Flemming. But in the days after, the unexpected happened. The hurricane that had been heading out harmlessly to sea, swerved from its course. Hitching westward, toward shore, it smashed the city of Savannah, Georgia, resulting in one recorded death and damage estimated at millions of dollars. Despite no firm evidence, Langmuir said he was ""99% sure"" the storm had changed course due to the seeding. Fears among the public and questions from meteorologists plagued Project Cirrus until it ended in 1952. But the US military maintained a strong interest in storm modification as their involvement in the Vietnam War escalated in the 1960s, says Harper. ""The Navy had a secret programme out at China Lake Naval Air Station [in California] where they were working on seeding techniques or weather-control techniques that were going to be used in Laos in Vietnam,"" she says. These classified missions, codenamed Operation Popeye, aimed to develop a ""weather weapon"" that could seed rain storms to wash out the Ho Chi Minh Trail, the North Vietnamese military supply line. For these efforts, says Harper, a civilian programme to research weather modification would provide the ""perfect cover"".  According to Stormfury's working hypothesis, by seeding the area just outside the eye wall with silver iodide, they could cause clouds to form a second eyewall, which in turn would compete with the inner eye wall. If they could make an eyewall to reform at a greater width, they expected that they would slow the hurricane's speed, Harper explains – like an ice skater extending their arms to slow their twirl. ""If they could reduce the wind speed by 10% or so, that could make a difference in the category of intensity at landfall,"" says Willoughby, who started out flying storm-monitoring missions in the Pacific for the US Navy during the early 1970s. If a 100mph (160 km/h) wind could be slowed to (80km/h), it would actually lose 75% of its force. Hurricane Esther would provide the crucial test for the theory. Emerging around the islands of Cabo Verde (Cape Verde) in September 1961, the storm was becoming more intense as it swept through the Atlantic, about 400 miles (640km) north of Puerto Rico. On 16 September, an aircraft belonging to the US Weather Bureau flew through Esther's eyewall and dropped eight canisters of silver iodide into the raging winds. On a radar instrument monitoring Esther, US Weather Bureau planes detected a weakening of the eyewall. Despite other checks showing no change, it was declared a success, the Stormfury era was officially launched. The 1947 Project Cirrus mission still loomed large, despite research indicating the hurricane had already begun to turn before the seeding flight. As a result, Stormfury was restricted by a stringent set of requirements for how and where hurricanes could be modified. What resulted was a polygon zone drawn on a map: a confined experimental area, over the open Atlantic far from the US – yet close enough to Cuba that Fidel Castro accused the US of trying to attack his communist regime. As a result of these restrictions, many storm seasons came and went during the 1960s, as Stormfury waited on call, frustrated. After another seeding mission in 1963, which produced mostly inconclusive results, Hurricane Betsy in 1965 appeared the perfect candidate, explains Golden, who joined Stormfury in 1964 and spent four decades at National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa). As the hurricane approached the Caribbean, Golden recalls Stormfury's leaders, the pioneering meteorologists Joanne and Robert Simpson, waiting on the line for Noaa's chief Robert White to give the go-ahead. ""We could only seed if the eye was within a prescribed area – and it was 50 miles [80km] outside the prescribed area,"" he says, so the crew stood down. Although a huge disappointment to the team, that turned out to be a stroke of luck, he adds, which avoided a repeat of Project Cirrus's controversy. ""Hurricane Betsy made a very strange loop and it actually tracked to the south-west and hit just south of Miami."" Stormfury's biggest mission would finally arrive in 1969. On 18 and 20 August, 13 aircraft were involved in five runs across Hurricane Debbie, including a Navy A-6 Intruder jet, which dropped 1,000 silver iodide canisters each day. After nearly a decade of false starts, the data they gathered was jaw-dropping: most encouragingly, they documented a second eye wall emerging after seeding flights, with weaker winds, matching the hypothesis. During the two seeding days, winds decreased by 31% and 15%. Stormfury director R Cecil Gentry concluded that there was less than a one-in-10 chance of this happening naturally and his paper in the journal Science found that the data suggested the storm had been successfully modified by the scientists. Debbie was not the springboard to greater success that many involved in the project hoped. The last seeding flight flew in 1971, dropping canisters into the ill-defined eyewall of Hurricane Ginger with no discernible effect. Later the same year the Navy pulled support. The Navy's exit was in part because they no longer needed to test it, says Harper: ""They were using the techniques in Vietnam and Laos – they didn't need to test them in the Atlantic anymore on hurricanes."" Figures revealed in the Pentagon Papers in 1974 showed a far less cautious use of  silver iodide and similar compounds in Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos, where Air Force and Navy planes dropped in a total of 47,409 canisters in 2,600 seeding missions. In total, Stormfury's seeding flights had dropped canisters of silver iodide into four hurricanes on eight different days. Data across these flights found that on four days, winds reduced, falling in wind-speed by between 10% or more. Other days, nothing happened, which was blamed on flights failing to hit targets or poorly chosen storms. With few candidate storms in the Atlantic, during the 1970s, the US attempted to strike deals with Australia and the Philippines to run further tests on storms in the Pacific Ocean, off their coastlines. ""The countries in the Pacific Rim just said, no,"" says Harper. ""Just: 'No. That's not going to happen.'"" Around the time of Debbie's apparent success, the scientific basis of the project began to crumble. Images appeared to show some hurricanes spontaneously developed multiple concentric eyewalls, a phenomenon that Willoughby personally observed while flying through tropical storms with the Navy. If this was the case, Debbie's results could be mere coincidence. At the same time, research increasingly questioned whether hurricanes contained the vast clouds of supercooled water that Stormfury believed could be seeded, instead finding ice, which would be unaffected by silver iodide. ""Probably [either] one would have carried the day in an objective scientific evaluation,"" says Willoughby. Although he had joined Stormfury with the intention of contributing to storm modification, being assigned to seeding crews, Willoughby never flew a seeding mission and found a project adrift. ""Frankly, to my mind, the experiment did not seem to be well-thought-out in those later days,"" he says. Writing the final evaluation of the project in 1985, Willougby concluded that despite the team's determined efforts, ""the expected results of seeding are often indistinguishable from naturally occurring intensity changes"".  To all involved, it was clear that Stormfury was never a normal meteorological study – instead, an experiment that began ""at the wrong end"", according to the Navy's project leader Pierre St Amand, quoted in Make it Rain. Because of the project's military value, and potential impact on civilian safety, Stormfury received millions of dollars in funding and support that most meteorological studies can only imagine. At the same time, hurricane science was still in its infancy, with not enough known to make accurate predictions about their interior structure and behaviour. ""There was a germ of science,"" Harper summarises. But it's a pretty safe bet Stormfury would've remained in the lab if it weren't for military interests, she adds. Nevertheless, the project delivered results that are still keeping us safe in other ways. ""The aircraft measurements taught us a lot about hurricane structure and behaviour,"" says Joe Golden. ""And those data helped to improve the models at the time."" The funding it generated for meteorology helped address these knowledge gaps.  Willoughby, who is currently a research professor at Florida International University, says that since the start of Stormfury, the 24-hour forecast for hurricane's path has vastly increased in accuracy, from an error of more 120 nautical miles (138 miles/222km) to around 50 nautical miles (58 miles/93km), and forecast of hurricane intensity have improved from vague guidance to predictions accurate to within 10 knots (12mph/19km/h). Data gathered by the observer planes are still being researched, and instruments developed by Stormfury provide more accurate ways for airplanes to track hurricanes. Two highly modified P3 airplanes that were purchased for Stormfury – known affectionately as Kermit and Miss Piggy – continue to be used, some 50 years on. For some, Stormfury is unfinished work. ""Stormfury was one of the most frustrating scientific experiments in my life,"" Golden says. ""In a nutshell, I think that Noaa gave up too soon."" Over the years, Golden has continued to make a case for government agencies to step up and show ambition to make hurricane modification a reality. Spurred by Hurricane Katrina in 2005, in which nearly 2,000 people died, Golden began working with the US Department of Homeland Security on ""Hamp"", the Hurricane Aerosol and Microphysics Program. ""It was also aimed at weakening hurricanes, but it had a whole different approach. Instead of silver iodide, we were going to use very tiny salt aerosols as the seeding agent,"" he says. ""Had the funding continued, we were going to do some field experiments – not on hurricanes initially, but just on cloud lines.""  ""The modeling results were very, very encouraging,"" he says, indicating that aerosols could not only diminish a hurricane's intensity but alter its course. ""That's very important: if you can steer a hurricane like Katrina away from New Orleans, think of all the lives and the property damage that you would have saved."" ""That had some very tantalising results but – yet again – the funding ran out,"" he says. Willoughby, meanwhile, feels Noaa was right to end research. ""It was a beguiling idea – what's not to like about making it rain in the desert or keeping typhoons and hurricanes from wrecking cities?"" he asks. ""But the science didn't work out."" For anyone with a theory of how to stop hurricanes, the hurdles are clear, says Willoughby. ""What you do is you come up with an idea, you'd have to do a tabletop experiment or a small-scale field trial, and then use that to simulate it in a numerical model."" Yet he doubts a solution will find a way to match the force of a tropical storm – even if we use nuclear weapons.  Stormfury was a humbling reality check, says Willoughby, pitting humans against the ""immense"" energy of a hurricane – estimated to be equivalent to a 10-megatonne nuclear bomb exploding every 20 minutes. ""Perhaps some day, somebody will come up with a way to weaken hurricanes artificially,"" he writes in an email. ""Wouldn't it be wonderful if we could do it."" --  If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.

6/7/2025,Article,News,Polo-loving drug lord's double life catches up with him,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c14jpymxrkno,"On the surface, Muhammed Asif Hafeez was an upstanding individual. A global businessman and ambassador of a prestigious London polo club, he rubbed shoulders with the British elite, including members of the Royal Family. He also regularly passed on detailed information to the authorities in the UK and Middle East that, in some cases, led to the interception of huge shipments of drugs. He was motivated, he said, simply by what he saw as his ""moral obligation to curb and highlight criminal activities"". At least, that is what he would have had people think. In reality, Hafeez was himself what US officials described as ""one of the world's most prolific drug traffickers"". From his residence in the UK, he was the puppet-master of a vast drugs empire, supplying many tonnes of heroin, methamphetamine and hashish from bases in Pakistan and India that were distributed across the world. The gangs he informed on were his rivals - and his motivation was to rid the market of his competitors. His status in the underworld earned him the moniker ""the Sultan"". But this criminal power and prestige would not last forever. After a complex joint operation between the British and American authorities, Hafeez, 66, was extradited from the UK in 2023. He pleaded guilty last November.  On Friday, he was sentenced to 16 years in a New York prison for conspiring to import drugs - including enough heroin for ""millions of doses"" - into the US. Having been in custody since 2017, Hafeez’s sentence will end in 2033. The BBC has closely followed Hafeez's case. We have pieced together information from court documents, corporate listings and interviews with people who knew him. We wanted to find out how he managed to stay under the radar for so long - and how he eventually got caught. Hafeez was born in September 1958 to a middle-class family in Lahore, Pakistan. One of six children, his upbringing was comfortable. People in Lahore who knew the family told the BBC that his father had owned a factory near the city. Hafeez also later told a US court that he had trained as a commercial pilot. From the early 1990s to about the mid-2010s, he ran an outwardly legitimate umbrella company called Sarwani International Corporation, with subsidiary businesses in Pakistan, the UAE and the UK. According to its website - which has since been shut down - it sold technical equipment to militaries, governments and police forces throughout the world, including equipment for drug detection. Among the other businesses under the Sarwani umbrella were a textiles company registered in various countries, an Italian restaurant in Lahore that was a franchise of a well-known Knightsbridge brand, and a company named Tipmoor, based near Windsor to the west of London, which specialised in ""polo and equestrian services"". These businesses not only afforded him a luxury lifestyle, but secured him access to the UK's most exclusive circles. He was listed as an international ambassador for the prestigious Ham Polo Club for at least three years, from 2009 to 2011. He and his wife Shahina were also photographed chatting to Prince William, and embracing Prince Harry, at the club in 2009. Ham Polo Club told the BBC that Hafeez had never been a member of the club, that the club no longer has ""ambassadors"", and that the current board ""has no ties to him"". It added that the event at which Hafeez and his wife were photographed meeting the princes ""was run by a third party"". Sarwani's different global arms were dissolved at various stages in the 2010s, according to their listings on Companies House and equivalent global registries. A former Sarwani employee based in the UAE told the BBC he suspected there had been ""something fishy going on"" when he worked for the business, because even big projects were ""only paid for in cash"". The employee - who has asked not to be identified, for fear of reprisals - said he eventually left the business because he felt uncomfortable with this. ""There were no [bank] transactions, no records, no existence,"" he told the BBC. Hafeez would also periodically write letters to the authorities in the UAE and UK informing on rival cartels, under the guise of being a concerned member of the public. The BBC has seen these, as well as letters he received in response from the British Embassy in Dubai and the UK Home Office, thanking him and expressing their appreciation for him getting in touch. The Home Office told the BBC it does not comment on individual correspondence. The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office and the Government of Dubai were contacted by the BBC for comment but did not respond. Members of Hafeez's family shared these letters with the BBC in 2018, while he was embroiled in a lengthy legal fight against extradition to the US.  They also submitted them to courts in the UK and, later, to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR), as evidence that he had been an informant and needed protection. All the courts disagreed and ruled that this was a ploy by Hafeez to rid the market of competitors. Hafeez, the ECHR said, was ""someone who had brought to the attention of the authorities the criminal conduct of others who he knew to be actual or potential rivals to his substantial criminal enterprise"". While Hafeez was writing these letters, a meeting took place in 2014 that - despite him not being there - would lead to his downfall. Two of Hafeez's close associates met a potential buyer from Colombia in a flat in Mombasa, Kenya. They burned a small amount of heroin in order to demonstrate how pure it was, and said they could supply him with any quantity of ""100%... white crystal"". The supplier of this high-quality heroin, they had told the buyer, was a man from Pakistan known as ""the Sultan"" - that is, Hafeez. What they would soon learn was that the ""buyer"" from Colombia was actually working undercover for the US's Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). The entire meeting was part of an elaborate sting operation, and had been covertly filmed - footage that has been obtained by the BBC. US court documents reveal the deal was co-ordinated by Baktash and Ibrahim Akasha, two brothers who led a violent cartel in Kenya. Their father was himself a feared kingpin who had been killed in Amsterdam's Red Light District in 2000. The deal also involved Vijaygiri ""Vicky"" Goswami, an Indian national who managed the Akashas' operations. In October 2014, with the Akashas, Goswami and Hafeez still unaware of who the buyers really were, 99kg of heroin and 2kg of crystal meth were delivered to the fake Colombian traffickers. The Akashas promised to provide hundreds of kilograms more of each drug. A month later, the Akasha brothers and Goswami were arrested in Mombasa. They were released on bail shortly afterwards, and spent over two years fighting extradition to the US. In the background, American law enforcers were working with counterparts in the UK to piece together their case against Hafeez, partly using evidence gathered from devices they had seized when they arrested Goswami and the Akasha brothers. On those, they had found multiple references to Hafeez as a major supplier, and were able to find enough evidence to identify him as ""the Sultan"". Facing charges in the US didn't stop one of the men, Goswami, from continuing his illegal enterprise. In 2015, while on bail in Kenya, he hatched a plan with Hafeez to transport several tonnes of a drug called ephedrine from a chemical factory in Solapur, India, to Mozambique. Ephedrine, a powerful medication that is legal in limited quantities, is used to make methamphetamine. The two men - Goswami and Hafeez - planned to set up a meth factory in Mozambique's capital, Maputo, US court documents show. But their scheme was abandoned in 2016, when police raided the Solapur plant and seized 18 tonnes of ephedrine. The Akasha brothers and Goswami finally boarded a flight to the US to face trial in January 2017.  Hafeez was arrested eight months later in London, at his flat in the affluent St John's Wood neighbourhood. He was detained at high security Belmarsh Prison in south-east London, and it was from there that he spent six years fighting extradition to the US. A big development happened in 2019 in the US. Goswami pleaded guilty, and told a New York court he had agreed to co-operate with prosecutors. The Akasha brothers also pleaded guilty. Baktash Akasha was sentenced to 25 years in prison. His brother Ibrahim was sentenced to 23 years. Goswami, who is yet to be sentenced, would have testified against Hafeez in the US had the case gone to trial. From Belmarsh, Hafeez was running out of options. He tried to stop extradition to the US - but failed to convince magistrates, the High Court in London and the ECHR that he had, in fact, been an informant to the authorities who was ""at risk of ill-treatment from his fellow prisoners"" as a result.  He also claimed the conditions in a US prison would be ""inhuman and degrading"" for him because of his health conditions, including type 2 diabetes and asthma. He lost all of these arguments at every stage and was extradited in May 2023. His case did not go to trial. In November last year, Hafeez pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiring to manufacture and distribute heroin, methamphetamine and hashish and to import them into the US.  Pre-sentencing, prosecutors described the ""extremely fortunate circumstances"" of Hafeez's life, which ""throw into harsh relief his decision to scheme... and to profit from the distribution of dangerous substances that destroy lives and whole communities"". ""Unlike many traffickers whose drug activities are borne, at least in part, from desperation, poverty, and a lack of educational opportunities,"" they said, ""the defendant has lived a life replete with privilege and choice.""

6/7/2025,Article,News,US brings back El Salvador deportee to face charges,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7v7ynv98r8o,"Kilmar Ábrego García, a 29-year-old from El Salvador mistakenly deported in March, has been returned to the US to face prosecution on two federal criminal charges. He has been accused of participating in a trafficking conspiracy over several years to move undocumented migrants from Texas to other parts of the country.  El Salvador agreed to release Mr Ábrego García after the US presented it with an arrest warrant, US Attorney General Pam Bondi said on Friday. His lawyer called the charges ""preposterous"". The White House had been resisting a US Supreme Court order from April to ""facilitate"" his return after he was sent to a jail in El Salvador alongside more than 250 other deportees.  In a two-count grand jury indictment, filed in a Tennessee court last month and unsealed on Friday, Mr Ábrego García was charged with one count of conspiracy to transport aliens and a second count of unlawful transportation of undocumented aliens.  Bondi said the grand jury had found that Mr Ábrego García had played a ""significant role"" in an alien smuggling ring, bringing in thousands of illegal immigrants to the US. The charges, which date back to 2016, allege he transported undocumented individuals between Texas and Maryland and other states more than 100 times.   The indictment also alleges he transported members of MS-13, designated a foreign terrorist organisation by the US.  The Trump administration had previously alleged Mr Ábrego García was a member of the transnational Salvadorian gang, which he has denied.  Bondi also accused Mr Ábrego García of trafficking weapons and narcotics into the US for the gang, though he was not charged with any related offences.    He appeared in court for an initial hearing on Friday in Nashville, Tennessee. An arraignment hearing is scheduled 13 June, where US Magistrate Judge Barbara Holmes will determine if there are grounds to keep him detained ahead of his trial.  For now, Mr Ábrego García remains in federal custody. Mr Ábrego García's lawyers have previously argued that he had never been convicted of any criminal offence, including gang membership, in the US or in El Salvador. Simon Sandoval Moshenberg, one of his attorneys, called the events an ""abuse of power"" at a news conference on Friday.  ""The government disappeared Kilmar to a foreign prison in violation of a court order,"" Mr Moshenberg said. ""Now, after months of delay and secrecy, they're bringing him back, not to correct their error but to prosecute him."" He added: ""This is an abuse of power, not justice. The government should give him a full and fair trial in front of the same immigration judge who heard the case in 2019."" US President Donald Trump called Mr Ábrego García a ""bad guy"" while speaking to reporters on Friday, and said the US Department of Justice had made the right decision to return him to face trial. Mr Ábrego García entered the US illegally as a teenager from El Salvador. In 2019, he was arrested with three other men in Maryland and detained by federal immigration authorities. But an immigration judge granted him protection from deportation on the grounds that he might be at risk of persecution from local gangs in his home country. On 15 March, he was deported amid an immigration crackdown by the Trump administration, after it invoked the Alien Enemies Act, a wartime law that allows presidents to detain or deport the natives and citizens of an enemy country. Mr Ábrego García was taken to the Cecot mega-prison in El Salvador, known for its brutal conditions.  While government lawyers initially said he was taken there as a result of ""administrative error"", the Trump administration refused to order his return.  Whether or not the government had to ""facilitate"" his return to his home in the US state of Maryland became the subject of a weeks-long legal and political battle. After Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen demanded to see Mr Ábrego García in El Salvador, he was released to a different prison in that country.  Van Hollen reiterated on Friday that ""this is not about the man, it's about his constitutional rights - and the rights of all"".  ""The administration will now have to make its case in the court of law, as it should have all along.""  El Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele, a close ally of Trump, wrote on social media on Friday that if the administration ""request the return of a gang member to face charges, of course we wouldn't refuse"".  At Mr Ábrego García's court appearance in Tennessee next Friday, the US will request he be held in pretrial custody ""because he poses a danger to the community and a serious risk of flight"", according to the detention motion.

6/7/2025,Article,Sport,Gauff and Sabalenka face off in French Open final,https://www.bbc.com/sport/tennis/articles/cvgnmlmjv0do,"Coco Gauff and Aryna Sabalenka have the joint-most Tour-level wins on clay this season with 17 each French Open 2025 - women's singles final Venue: Roland Garros Time: 14:00 BST Dates: 25 May-8 June  Coverage: Live radio commentary on 5 Live Sport and BBC Sounds, plus live text commentary on the BBC Sport website and app For the first time in seven years, the best two women's players in the world will meet in a Grand Slam final when Aryna Sabalenka and Coco Gauff face off at the French Open. A new women's singles champion will be crowned either way, with world number one Sabalenka seeking a fourth major singles title and second-ranked Gauff a second. Gauff, the US Open champion in 2023, finished runner-up in Paris three years ago, while two-time Australian Open winner and last year's New York champion Sabalenka is in a first Roland Garros final. The pair have five wins apiece from 10 previous meetings before going head-to-head on Court Philippe Chatrier, where the winner will take home 2.5m euros (Â£2.1m) and 2,000 ranking points. This video can not be played I feel really comfortable on this surface - Sabalenka Sabalenka and Gauff overcame two very different challenges in their respective semi-finals. Underlining her position as title favourite, Sabalenka ended four-time champion Iga Swiatek's 26-match run with an impressive three-set victory. Gauff, meanwhile, was up against a partisan crowd but efficiently ended French wildcard Lois Boisson's fairytale run in straight sets. Sabalenka continues to show remarkable consistency at the sport's highest level, with this her third successive major singles final. The 27-year-old is the first woman to achieve that feat since the great Serena Williams nine years ago. Sabalenka has competed in 10 tournaments this year, reaching seven finals, and she leads the WTA Tour with 40 wins in 46 matches. Gauff, meanwhile, continues to emerge as a force to be reckoned with on clay. The 21-year-old, bidding for her first title of the season, is the youngest woman to reach the finals at Madrid, Rome and the French Open in the same year. With her run to the Roland Garros final, she has also become the youngest player to amass 70 wins at Grand Slam tournaments since Maria Sharapova in 2007. This video can not be played Win or lose the final, the sun will rise - Gauff There is nothing to split Sabalenka and Gauff in the overall head-to-head record. They each have one win at the majors, with Gauff defeating Sabalenka in the 2023 US Open final before Sabalenka took revenge in their Australian Open semi-final in 2024. Both have a win each on clay, with Gauff prevailing in the Italian Open fourth round in 2021 and Sabalenka claiming a straight-set win in their most recent meeting in the Madrid final. That victory in May perhaps gives Sabalenka a slight edge in Paris, given she has won three of their past four meetings. But with half of their encounters going the distance - and both players losing just one set in their six matches so far - expectations are high for Saturday's showpiece. Known for her brutal hitting, Sabalenka has been typecast as a hard-court specialist throughout her career, with all three of her major singles titles won on that surface. But she is ever adapting her game. Against Swiatek, she kept the key points short and stifled the clay-court expert's game with devastating accuracy. Asked how it would feel to win the French Open, Sabalenka said: ""It's going to mean everything to me and my team. ""Almost [my] whole life I've been told [clay] is not my thing and then I didn't have any confidence. ""If I'll be able to get this trophy, it's going to mean the world for us."" Gauff knows what to expect from Sabalenka - but overcoming that challenge is a different matter. She will have to be at her best defensively to withstand Sabalenka's power and try to draw her into longer rallies. Holding her serve and keeping double faults to a minimum will be key to keeping pressure on Sabalenka and supply a platform for creating opportunities to build on her tournament-leading tally of converted break points (40).  ""She's going to come out aggressive, she's going to come out swinging,"" Gauff said. ""I think I just have to expect that and do my best to kind of counter that.  ""Anything can happen on Saturday. I'm looking forward to it, and I'm glad to be going up against a world number one, too."" Later on Saturday, British pair Joe Salisbury and Neal Skupski contest the French Open men's doubles final against Spain's Marcel Granollers and Argentina's Horacio Zeballos. Copyright Â© 2025 BBC.

6/7/2025,Article,News,Chinese boy fell to death after slip at Irish clifftop,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy30nqwy99o,"A 12-year-old boy fell to his death at Ireland's Cliffs of Moher after slipping in a puddle close to the edge, an inquest has heard. Zhihan Zhao and his mother, both Chinese nationals, were with her friends at the beauty spot on the County Clare coast on 23 July last year when he walked ahead of the group. The coroner embraced Zhihan's distraught mother after recording a verdict of accidental death.  The accident was the second fatal fall at the Cliffs of Moher within a three-month period last year.  Warning: this story contains details some may find distressing. Zhihan and his mother, Xianhong Huang, had arrived in Ireland 12 days before his fatal fall.  In her deposition, Ms Huang said that Zhihan was walking ahead of her on the Cliffs of Moher trail when she lost sight of him. ""My son walked very fast and was ahead of us by 50 metres,"" she said. ""As there was only one path, I thought we would meet him along the way.  ""When I didn't, I walked to the visitor centre and I checked the visitor centre."" Unable to find him at the visitor centre, she returned to the path to search for him and when there was no sign of him, she reported him missing. Ms Huang said she had last seen Zhihan at 13:00 that day and the court heard she  had provided gardaí (Irish police) with a photo of him she had taken earlier on the trail. Speaking through an interpreter at the inquest in Kilrush, County Clare, Ms Huang, wiping away tears, asked: ""What exactly caused Zhihan to fall from the cliffs?"" Clare County Coroner Isobel O'Dea told the grieving mother that the evidence of an eyewitness would help answer that question. A French tourist who witnessed him fall told Clare Coroner's Court she had seen him slip and try to pull himself up by grasping at grass, before he disappeared over the edge.  French tourist Marion Tourgon told the inquest she had witnessed the fall at about 13:45 that day. Ms Tourgon explained she had been at the edge of the cliffs with her husband and two children, taking a selfie at the time.  She describing seeing a young Asian boy, who was alone, come into view. ""I saw him slipping in the puddle that appears in the photo that my husband sent to the police,"" the witness said.  ""His right foot slipped into the puddle, with him trying to stop himself from falling with his left foot but his left foot ended up in the air."" Ms Tourgon added: ""It was very quick - he found himself in an awkward position with his left foot in a void over the cliff and his right knee on the edge of the cliff."" She continued: ""His right knee eventually fell into the void over the cliff and he was trying to grasp the grass with his hands to pull himself up.  ""He didn't shout and there was no noise."" The Tourgon family then phoned the emergency services. An air, land and sea search operation began involving the Irish Coast Guard, gardaí and Irish civil defence volunteers who used boats, drones, divers and a helicopter. A police witness, Garda Colm Collins, told the inquest he had received a call at 14:00 that day after a male was seen falling off the edge of the Cliffs of Moher.  He said that the Irish Coast Guard had spotted a body floating in the water at the base of the cliffs.  The court heard a lifeboat had been launched but had not been able to access the site where the body was spotted because of the sea conditions. It was another five days before Zhihan's body was eventually recovered from the sea. The boy was found by a fisherman, Matthew O'Halloran, from Corofin, County Clare. He spotted a body face down with arms extended in the water between Doolin and the Aran Islands shortly after 10:00 on 28 July. Mr O'Halloran alerted the Irish Coast Guard and its members retrieved Zhihan's body and brought it ashore at Doolin. The coroner said post-mortem results had confirmed that Zhihan died from multiple traumatic injuries consistent with a fall from a height. ""It is clear from evidence we heard that Zhihan slipped off the cliffs rather than any other way. His death would have been very quick - instantaneous."" Addressing the boy's mother, she said: ""I can't imagine how upsetting this is for you."" Ms O'Dea also extended her sympathies to Zhihan's father who was not present at the inquest. She embraced Ms Huang as she left the coroner's court. In May 2024, a student in her 20s lost her footing on the cliffs while walking with friends and fell to her death.  Since August last year, large sections of the Cliffs of Moher trail have been closed due to safety concerns. At the time, the Clare Local Development Company confirmed that it was taking the action following the two fatal accidents. Copyright 2025 BBC.

6/7/2025,Article,News,The decades-old intrigue over an Indian guest house in Mecca,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy3gqz48qzo,"As the annual Hajj pilgrimage draws to a close, a long-settled corner of Mecca is stirring up a storm thousands of miles away in India - not for its spiritual significance, but for a 50-year-old inheritance dispute. At the heart of the controversy is Keyi Rubath, a 19th-Century guest house built in the 1870s by Mayankutty Keyi, a wealthy Indian merchant from Malabar (modern-day Kerala), whose trading empire stretched from Mumbai to Paris. Located near Islam's holiest site, Masjid al-Haram, the building was demolished in 1971 to make way for Mecca's expansion. Saudi authorities deposited 1.4 million riyals (about $373,000 today) in the kingdom's treasury as compensation, but said no rightful heir could be identified at the time. Decades later, that sum - still held in Saudi Arabia's treasury - has sparked a bitter  tussle between two sprawling branches of the Keyi family, each trying to prove its lineage and claim what they see as their rightful inheritance. Neither side has succeeded so far. For decades, successive Indian governments - both at the Centre and in Kerala - have tried and failed to resolve the deadlock. It remains unclear if Saudi authorities are even willing to release the compensation, let alone adjust it for inflation as some family members now demand -  with some claiming it could be worth over $1bn today.  Followers of the case note the property was a waqf - an Islamic charitable endowment - meaning descendants can manage but not own it. The Saudi department that handles Awqaf (endowed properties) did not respond to the BBC's request for comment, and the government has made no public statement on the matter. That hasn't stopped speculation - about both the money and who it rightfully belongs to. Little is known about the guest house itself, but descendants claim it stood just steps from the Masjid al-Haram, with 22 rooms and several halls spread over 1.5 acres.  According to family lore, Keyi shipped wood from Malabar to build it and appointed a Malabari manager to run it - an ambitious gesture, though not unusual for the time.  Saudi Arabia was a relatively poor country back then - the discovery of its massive oil fields still a few decades away. The Hajj pilgrimage and the city's importance in Islam meant that Indian Muslims often donated money or built infrastructure for Indian pilgrims there. In his 2014 book, Mecca: The Sacred City, historian Ziauddin Sardar notes that during the second half of the 18th Century, the city had acquired a distinctively Indian character with its economy and financial well-being dependent on Indian Muslims. ""Almost 20% of the city's inhabitants, the largest single majority, were now of Indian origins – people from Gujarat, Punjab, Kashmir and Deccan, all collectively known locally as the Hindis,"" Sardar wrote. As Saudi Arabia's oil wealth surged in the 20th century, sweeping development projects reshaped Mecca. Keyi Rubath was demolished three times, the final time in the early 1970s. That's when the confusion around compensation appears to have started.  According to BM Jamal, former secretary of India's Central Waqf Council, the Indian consulate in Jeddah wrote to the government back then, seeking details of Mayankutty Keyi's legal heir.  ""In my understanding, authorities were looking for the descendants to appoint a manager for the property, not to distribute the compensation money,"" Mr Jamal said. Nonetheless, two factions stepped forward: the Keyis - Mayankutty's paternal family - and the Arakkals, a royal family from Kerala into which he had married.  Both families traditionally followed a matrilineal inheritance system -  a custom not recognized under Saudi law, adding further complexity. The Keyis claim that Mayankutty died childless, making his sister's children his rightful heirs under matrilineal tradition.  But the Arakkals claim he had a son and a daughter, and therefore, under Indian law, his children would be the legal inheritors. As the dispute dragged on, the story took on a life of its own. In 2011, after rumours swirled that the compensation could be worth millions, more than 2,500 people flooded a district office in Kannur, claiming to be Keyi's descendants. ""There were people who claimed that their forefathers had taught Mayankutty in his childhood. Others claimed that their forefathers had provided timber for the guest house,"" a senior Keyi family member, who wanted to stay anonymous, told the BBC. Scams followed. State officials say in 2017 fraudsters posing as Keyi descendants duped locals into handing over money, promising a share of the compensation.   Today, the case remains unresolved.  Some descendants propose the best way to end the dispute would be to ask the Saudi government to use the compensation money to build another guest house for Hajj pilgrims, as Myankutti Keyi had intended. But others reject this, arguing that the guest house was privately owned, and so any compensation rightfully belongs to the family. Some argue that even if the family proves lineage to Mayankutty Keyi, without ownership documents, they're unlikely to gain anything. For Muhammed Shihad, a Kannur resident who has co-authored a book on the history of the Keyi and Arakkal families, though, the dispute is not just about the money - but about honouring the family's roots.  ""If they don't get the compensation, it would be worth openly recognising the family's and the region's connection to this noble act."" Copyright 2025 BBC.

6/7/2025,Article,Travel,Six LGBTQ+ destinations around the world,https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20240627-six-lgbtq-destinations-around-the-world,"Beyond famous hotspots like Brighton and Berlin, these are some of the most accepting places for LGBTQ+ travellers to visit. Even though it's Pride season, it can still be a potentially nerve-racking time for LGBTQ+ travellers. While LGBTQ+ rights and visibility have increased greatly in the last decade, so have some increasingly intimidating threats, as the community continues to battle international customs, legality and cultural norms. Case in point: in May 2024, the US State Department issued a worldwide travel warning about the ""increased potential for foreign terrorist organisation-inspired violence against LGBTQI+ persons and events."" It recommends staying alert in locations ""frequented by tourists, including Pride celebrations and venues frequented by LGBTQI+ persons."" Matthieu Jost, CEO of LGBTQ+ accommodation app misterb&b, which has 1.3 million registered users, advises queer tourists to ""travel and stay like a local, particularly in areas you're not sure about, and get advice from LGBTQ+ residents before you even step foot in a new travel destination."" Even in less LGBTQ+-friendly places, Jost maintains that ""LGBTQ+ travellers often aren't as deterred to visit as you would expect, and that's likely due to local gay hosts as well as allies within the community itself.""   Due vigilance aside, there are still hundreds of queer-friendly destinations around the world, from Berlin to Mykonos and Amsterdam to Madrid. But for every Brighton and San Francisco that are famous for their inclusive culture, there many other queer-friendly destinations you may not think of, such as Torremolinos, Spain and Malta. This list of six LGBTQ+-friendly destinations is based on several sources, including the ILGA-Europe Rainbow Index, which ranks European countries on LGBTQ+ equality; its parent site, ILGA, which compiles global rankings; and Asher Fergusson's 2023 report on LGBTQ+ travel, which involved 400 hours of research and examines many factors related to LGBTQ+ safety – from protections against discrimination to same-sex marriage – in more than 200 countries. ""It was important for us to cover this topic because it so greatly affects so many travellers,"" said Lyric Fergusson, who runs the travel safety site with her partner, Asher. ""Unfortunately, the harsh reality is that the majority of the world is still far from safe for LGBTQ+ people. But because laws are always being revised, it's our mission to update this list at least once a year."" Here are six LGBTQ+-friendly destinations on five continents proving that despite recent warnings, much of the world remains an open, welcoming place. Standing proudly at #1 on the Asher Fergusson list is Canada, which decriminalised homosexual acts back in 1969 and same-sex marriage in 2005. While its largest city, Toronto, hosts one the world's largest Pride celebrations (running through 30 June 2024), Montreal's queer scene is pioneering: back in 1918, this was where the first-known queer magazine in North America was published, Les Mouches Fantastiques. The epicentre of the city's LGBTQ+ scene, The Village, in Ville-Marie, is the province of Quebec's largest gay neighbourhood. Its main drag, Saint Catherine Street East, is home to a buzzy strip of bars like Le Stud, Aigle Noir and Complexe Sky. Non-binary, queer women and trans visitors should also check out parties such as Elle Lui and Sweet Like Honey. ""The queer community is well-mixed between anglophones and francophones, so I guess some kind of richness comes with having most of our events bilingual,"" said Theo Tessier from the Montreal LGBTQ+ Community Centre, established in 1988, whose library, she explained, holds ""more than 20,000 books, essays, documentaries and films."" Meanwhile Montreal's Gay Archives, which is open to the public, contain thousands of books, zines, posters and periodicals. Thailand legalised same-sex activity back in 1956 and has laws that ban discrimination over gender identity and sexual orientation. What's more, the same-sex marriage bill was just passed last week, making Thailand the only South-East Asian country to recognise same-sex unions. However, since same-sex marriages still weren't legal in 2023, the Asher Fergusson report placed it at #62 on its most recent list. ""And yet, Bangkok is truly one of the most LGBTQ+-friendly destinations in the world"" for travellers, said Blue Satittammanoon, founder of White Party Bangkok, an annual event attracting 32,000 attendees from 93 countries. ""It's not only the largest gay dance festival in Asia,"" he said, ""but also the biggest gay New Year's Eve in the world."" For those visiting, Satittammanoon recommended neighbourhoods like Silom, home to venues such as ""DJ Station, G Bangkok and The Stranger Bar, plus new clubs like Beef and Rush"". As Satittammanoon said, the key to Bangkok being a ""haven for LGBTQ travellers [is] Thailand's [increasingly] progressive stance on LGBTQ rights, coupled with the warm hospitality that is so deeply ingrained in Thai culture."" Belgium came in at third place on the ILGA-Europe Rainbow Index (after Malta at #1, and Iceland at #2), and #9 on the Asher Fergusson list. Astonishingly, same-sex activity was legalised here in 1795, and it was the second country in the world to legalise same-sex marriage back in 2003, after the Netherlands. While Brussels is sometimes regarded as a little buttoned-up, locals say its LGBTQ+ scene is second to none. The main hub of its queer scene is located on curving thoroughfare Rue De Marche au Charbon and its surrounding streets. Popular bars include historic spot Le Belgica, trading since the 1980s; Station BXL; and quirky bar Homo Erectus, home to drag artist Paula Roid. ""We're far ahead in terms of LGBTQ+ rights, whether it concerns queer parenthood or trans-identity,"" Roid said. ""Our queer artistic scene includes Kitsch and Cheap at The Agenda, a must-see non-binary bar, and Playback, which opens the doors of so-called straight places in order to raise awareness of our community."" Few people realise that same-sex relations were legalised in Mexico back in 1871. And even though Mexico City legalised same-sex marriages back in 2010, and the country's final state legalised same-sex unions in 2022, the country makes only #42 in Asher Fergusson's travel safety report due to issues around adoption and hate crimes. However, for more than 60 years, the Pacific coast resort town of Puerto Vallarta in the state of Jalisco has been an LGBTQ+ destination. In fact, by some estimates, roughly one-third of all tourists to the so-called ""San Francisco of Mexico"" are members of the LGBTQ+ community. As Omar Eduardo Rivera Aguayo of the Mexican LGBTQ+ rights organisation Yaaj said: ""In a country with one of the highest rates of hate crimes against the sexual diversity population, Puerto Vallarta stands out in an act of rebellion and acceptance as one of the most LGBTQ+-friendly destinations in the world."" Aguayo recommends the ""iconic"" cobblestoned gay-bourhood called the Romantic Zone, adding there are ""more than 40 bars and hotels exclusive to our diverse community,"" including long-running Palm Cabaret, which has hosted tribute shows to queer icons. A respectable #21 on the Asher Fergusson report, Australia's newly crowned largest city is home to the country's first-ever purpose-built LGBTQ+ space, Victorian Pride Centre, which opened in 2021 (and houses the queer bookshop Hares & Hyenas).     The state of Victoria is regarded as the country's most progressive, with Melbourne home to one of Australia's first queer political organisations, Daughters of Bilitis (Australia), formed in 1970. Key annual events include the Midsumma Festival and Melbourne Queer Film Festival (founded in 1991). Areas like Windsor, Fitzroy and St Kilda are all LGBTQ+ hubs, the latter home to the Prince Public Bar, a queer haunt since 1937. An essential newer opening is Beans Bar. More like this:  • The tiny European island of tolerance  • Where Spain's gay rights movement began  • How Brighton became an epicentre of freedom ""I like to think Melbourne is so queer-friendly due to how multicultural we are and our diverse backgrounds,"" said owner Beca Pressing. ""This has helped us form a community that is accepting. We're not the first lesbian bar, but we are the first lesbian, trans, non-binary and neurodivergent bar: our aim is to create a safe and inclusive space for those who are most disadvantaged in the community."" Brazil is listed at #33 on the Asher Ferguson report, due to ""the recent increase in violence towards the LGBTQ+ (especially trans community)."" Despite this, same-sex couples have enjoyed equal rights since 2013, while in 2019, laws were passed banning discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. In 2023, Booking.com placed Sao Paulo at #1 on its list of LGBTQ+-friendly destinations in Brazil, while also naming it as one of the world's Top LGBTQ+ Friendly Destinations for 2024. Sao Paulo's Pride festival (which started in 1997) is known as the largest in the world. Queer-friendly neighbourhoods include the bohemian Vila Madalena and upscale Jardins. An important LGBTQ+ thoroughfare is Frei Caneca Street, with dozens of shops and bars, while lesbian and queer female-friendly Espeto Bambu is in the artsy Pinheiros neighbourhood. And after a year-and-a-half closure, the Museum of Sexual Diversity, the first of its kind in Latin America, recently reopened. ""This physical expansion reflects the expansion of horizons that we aim for,"" explained director Carlos Gradim. ""It's the first step in a series of cultural and educational activities, creating important connections and dialogues for society: a sublime moment for us.""  --   If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.

6/7/2025,Article,Culture,On-screen portrayals of LGBTQ characters were 'messy' in 2024,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20241216-how-queer-tv-and-film-stories-got-real-in-2024,"From Queer to Baby Reindeer and Will & Harper, LGBTQ representation took a step forward as film and TV showed more varied and authentic characters than ever before. Luca Guadagnino's latest film, Queer, takes us to the dream-like streets of 1950s Mexico City, where we meet Lee (Daniel Craig) – a US expat who spends most of his time downing tequila shots, smoking, and (mostly unsuccessfully) pursuing young men. As Lee self-medicates with alcohol and opiates, he becomes infatuated with Allerton (Drew Starkey), a handsome former US navy serviceman who he meets by chance. The pair soon start a relationship where, for the first time, Lee experiences sex that feels reciprocal, with emotional strings attached. But Allerton soon becomes distant. As a confused Lee feels his young lover pulling away, he begins to ask: ""Is Allerton even queer?"" On the face of things, Queer couldn't be more different from sexy tennis drama Challengers – Guadagnino's previous film, starring Zendaya, Mike Faist and Josh O'Connor, which became a hit in April 2024. But there are similarities in how both films explore forbidden lust, the space between identity and desire. Screenwriter Justin Kuritzkes, who wrote both films, tells the BBC that he sees them as ""sister"" projects. ""As I was writing Queer, I didn't realise that it was an echo of Challengers,"" he says. ""But now, I see that very clearly – they're both movies that culminate in a conversation that is happening beyond language."" Aside from their constant simmering sexual tension, another thing that both films have in common is the audience never quite knowing who to root for. This is typical of a year where LGBTQ+ characters in films and TV shows have been seen in a wider variety of different scenarios, roles, and circumstances than ever before, from wholesome romances and coming out journeys, to queer murderers, and characters who put themselves in perplexing (and maddening) situations. In 2024, culture has shown us that LGBTQ+ people and relationships can be messy and complicated, with characters who are chaotic and flawed. Some might question the interpretation of Challengers as queer art. Aside from its gay director, the film is ostensibly about a heterosexual love triangle between tennis coach Tashi Duncan (Zendaya) and tennis pros Art Donaldson (Faist) and Patrick Sweig (O'Connor). Still, culture writer Zing Tsjeng thinks the queer fandom of the film, which was inescapable online for months surrounding the film's release, speaks for itself: ""Even if there isn't an explicit queer context, Guadagnino seems to have crafted the film with a deliberately queer sensibility."" Tsjeng thinks the casting of Zendaya as an impeccably dressed alpha female tennis coach is not only destined to spark ""a million lesbian awakenings"" (especially given the sport's history of pioneering lesbians, such as Billie Jean King) but her character has the makings of an icon for gay men, too. ""From the first moment we meet her, Tashi is bending these men to her will,"" she says. ""It's quite similar to the heroines of mid-20th Century cinema, who gay men have been obsessed with for decades."" The bond between Art and Patrick is the most intriguing (and erotic) in the film. Officially, the two of them are best friends-turned-enemies, but their relationship still radiates sweaty, playful, competitive sexual tension. Kuritzkes sees Patrick and Art as both ""brothers"" and ""orphans,"" who were effectively shunted off by their well-to-do parents to be raised at a tennis academy. Near the start of the film, the three leads drink cans of beer in a cheap hotel room, and Patrick shares the oddly touching story of how he instructed Art on how to masturbate when they were teenagers sharing a dorm room. ""They've gone through everything together, and they've shared a lot of the intimacy that you share with somebody who you grew up with,"" Kuritzkes says. ""And whether we acknowledge it or not, in every friendship, and especially in every male friendship between two guys who have literally grown up together since puberty, there's an unspoken hum of eroticism and repression."" In the early stages of the film, there is a scene where Art and Patrick end up sharing an impromptu kiss when Tashi excuses herself from what started out as a three-way smooch. But soon that is eclipsed by an unexpectedly homoerotic scene, where the pair playfully eat a stick of churros together. The moment went viral on social media, and was described as the film's ""best sex scene,"" with some fans even recreating the moment for Halloween. ""Art and Patrick's relationship was always very pronounced to me. In every draft of the script from the very first one, there was this theme of them both eating stuff that was shaped like a churro, whether it was hot dogs or smoking cigarettes or whatever,"" Kuritzkes says. ""Then when we got on set, Mike and Josh developed a deeper relationship and it turned into the iconic thing that it's become."" Netflix's Baby Reindeer, written by and starring Richard Gadd, was one of the year's most talked-about TV shows. It followed Donny (Gadd), an aspiring comedian who is targeted by a stalker, Martha (Jessica Gunning), who becomes an overwhelming (and terrifying) presence in his life. As Donny navigates their complicated relationship, he questions his own sexuality. We learn about his encounters with Darrien, a male TV executive (Tom Goodman-Hill) who plied him with drugs and sexually assaulted him. He also begins a relationship with Teri (Nava Mau), a trans woman he met on a trans dating app. One of the most interesting parts of Baby Reindeer is how it challenges our ideas of how victims are expected to behave. There are many points where Donny appears to encourage Martha's behaviour, or willingly returns to Darrien even though he knows he is abusing him. Jeffrey Ingold, who worked as an LGBTQ+ consultant on the Netflix show, tells the BBC that this represents a ""move towards more authentic, interesting and ultimately more real portrayals of queer characters on screen"". As a therapist with a successful career and her own apartment, Teri is a refreshing break from trans characters who are often portrayed as living precariously. (2020 Netflix documentary Disclosure unpacks numerous trans screen tropes, such as the long history of trans characters being portrayed as murder victims in hospital and crime dramas). ""One of the conversations we had was about making sure that Teri's character development wasn't entirely relational to Donny,"" Ingold says. ""We wanted to build in moments that showed Teri existing as her own person, so she wasn't just an object of his desire."" Part of Ingold's role as a consultant is helping shows to steer clear of harmful queer stereotypes without ""creating the most politically correct characters"". Ultimately, Donny ends up treating Teri – the person who seems to care about him the most – badly throughout their relationship, in part because he's ashamed of her and himself. ""Queer people are not all good. They're not all bad. There are layers within us as there are with any people,"" Ingold says. ""Representation isn't just about which identities you see on screen, but the spectrum of humanity."" This is on full display in Will & Harper – the Netflix docu-film starring Will Ferrell and his collaborator, Saturday Night Live comedy writer Harper Steele. After Steele came out as trans at the age of 61, the pair embark on a 17-day road trip across the US, to learn more about each other in this new phase of their decades-long friendship. As they travel from New York to California, they discuss what it means to be a trans person – and a friend of a trans person – in the US today, when the community is facing increased legal restrictions. The film refutes the idea that trans people are some kind of 21st-Century phenomenon. Steele gets very candid about her mental health struggles from a very young age, but also her insecurities about how she looks today, and her relationship with femininity. She tells the BBC that seeing stories like this will be central to humanising trans people in the years ahead. ""Representation is extremely important,"" she says. ""Every marginalised community needs both – representation in culture, but also political organising for legislative battles."" Will & Harper is as much about loving a trans person as it is about being trans. Ferrell says the film is one of the proudest moments of his career: ""To lend whatever currency I have to a project like this is the most satisfying thing."" Still, it is by no means a ""how-to"" guide. There are times where he well-meaningly gets things wrong, like when they go to a steakhouse in Texas and all-eyes are suddenly on Steele. Ferrell chooses to create a spectacle – by eating a steak in the middle of the restaurant, dressed in a Sherlock Holmes costume – which exposes her to confused staring and, when the footage makes it to social media, transphobic abuse. Ferrell now says he is so happy that those moments were left in, because they help the film to ""cut through in a way that is really impactful, and lead to meaningful conversations"". And Steele thinks the few uncomfortable parts represent an important lesson when supporting someone who is coming out: ""It's OK to be messy."" More like this:  • The novels capturing the UK's gay social elite • How Smalltown Boy became the ultimate gay anthem • History's most incredible drag queens and kings Speaking of mess, Layla – a British film released in November, which follows the story of a non-binary drag performer (Bilal Hasna) as they embark on a romance with a well-to-do city boy, Max (Louis Greatorex) – has plenty of it. The film is a wholesome, sexy story about two queer people from different backgrounds who each have their own baggage. It is most notable in its distinct lack of familial rejection or violence, which can tend to occur frequently in LGTBQ+ romance stories. Instead, the stakes are refreshingly low. ""I wanted the characters to be frustrating, messy, complicated, and make decisions that annoy the audience,"" says writer and director Amrou Al-Kadhi. ""Layla, the queer Arab protagonist, is not a victim as most audiences would expect. They lie a lot, they don't communicate, they cut people off, they people-please – they are very much the agent of their own chaos."" Thematically, Layla is the opposite of a movie like All of Us Strangers – Andrew Haigh's critically acclaimed romantic fantasy film, which explores grief, gay shame and loneliness. Both films coexisting in 2024 (All of Us Strangers came out in January in the UK), might be a sign that, as Ingold puts it, culture is ""moving past the time of audiences simply needing to see queer people,"" towards a norm where ""we want to see queer people in a range of different roles."" Looking back at the last 12 months, it certainly feels that way: there have been villains, like queer-coded killer Andrew Scott in Ripley, Netflix's neo-noir TV adaptation of the 1955 Patricia Highsmith novel. In Netflix's Christmas thriller, Black Doves, viewers may have found themselves rooting for Sam Young (Ben Whishaw), a strangely endearing gay assassin. And on the theme of variety, the streamer also offered up the uber-wholesome teen romance Heartstopper and The Boyfriend, Japan's first ever gay dating show. In Queer, the characters take us to so many different places, from the streets of 1950s Mexico to the South American jungle, and somewhere between dreams and fantasy. Ultimately, it's a story about something timeless: two people who aren't a match, no matter how much one or both of them might want to be. ""Luca [Guadagnino] has said that the movie is not a story of unrequited love, but of unsynchronised love,"" says Kuritzkes. ""That's really beautiful, because when I think about these two characters, Lee and Allerton, they are constantly trying to get in sync. For a moment it works and it's beautiful. But then there is a horror that sets in and it all becomes too intense, so they recoil."" As a protagonist, Lee is a sympathetic figure, but he could never be classed as a ""role model"". This feels like a sign that, with LGBTQ+ representation becoming more normalised in mainstream culture, queer characters are able to occupy a much more challenging space – somewhere between hero and villain, with both redeeming qualities and flaws. Perhaps this is a step towards an era of more honest, complex representation. ""We want characters that are as cruel and kind and honest and duplicitous and sympathetic and unsympathetic and ego-driven and selfless as the people we meet in real life,"" Kuritzkes says. ""Those contradictions are what makes somebody feel real.""

6/7/2025,Video,News,Did Trump win the re-election because of Musk?,https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/clyq9jeyzllo,US President Donald Trump and Elon Musk's relationship has come crashing down after an explosive row that started with the tech billionaire's disdain for the president's spending bill.  The partnership between the two men began when Musk endorsed Trump last July after an assassination attempt in Pennsylvania. Musk later went on to campaign for the president there and even gave away a few $1m cheques to voters.  BBC North America correspondent Nomia Iqbal asked voters in the key state if they thought Musk was the secret weapon that led Trump to win the 2024 presidential election. Copyright 2025 BBC.

6/7/2025,Article,News,'They have perfect dark skin': The African nation home to fashion's favourite models,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cre99ldr515o,"Wearing an understated but chic outfit, flowing braids and a dewy, make-up free face, Arop Akol looks like your typical off-duty model. She sinks into the sofa at the offices of her UK agency, First Model Management, and details the burgeoning career that has seen her walk runways for luxury brands in London and Paris. ""I had been watching modelling online since I was a child at the age of 11,"" Akol, now in her early twenties, tells the BBC. In the last three years, she has been streamed across the world while modelling, even sharing a runway with Naomi Campbell at an Off-White show. Travelling for work can get lonely, but Akol is constantly bumping into models from her birth country - the lush, but troubled South Sudan. ""South Sudanese people have become very well known for their beauty,"" says Akol, who has high cheekbones, rich, dark skin and stands 5ft 10in tall. Flick through a fashion magazine or scan footage of a runway show and you will see Akol's point - models born and raised in South Sudan, or those from the country's sizable diaspora, are everywhere. They range from up-and-comers, like Akol, to supermodels like Anok Yai, Adut Akech and Alek Wek.  After being scouted in a London car park in 1995, Wek was one of the very first South Sudanese models to find global success . She has since appeared on numerous Vogue covers and modelled for the likes of Dior and Louis Vuitton. And the popularity of South Sudanese models shows no signs of waning - leading industry platform Models.com compiles an annual list of modelling's top 50 ""future stars"" and in its latest selection, one in five models have South Sudanese heritage.  Elsewhere, Vogue featured four South Sudanese models in its article about the ""11 young models set to storm the catwalks in 2025"". ""The expectation of what a model should be - most of the South Sudanese models have it,"" says Dawson Deng, who runs South Sudan Fashion Week in the country's capital, Juba, with fellow ex-model Trisha Nyachak. ""They have the perfect, dark skin. They have the melanin. They have the height."" Lucia Janosova, a casting agent at First Model Management, tells the BBC: ""Of course they are beautiful... beautiful skin, the height.""  However, she says she is unsure exactly why fashion brands seek out South Sudanese models over other nationalities. ""I'm not able to tell you because there are lots of girls who are also beautiful and they are from Mozambique, or Nigeria, or different countries, right?"" Ms Janosova adds. Akur Goi, a South Sudanese model who has worked with designers like Givenchy and Armani, has a theory.  She believes South Sudanese models are in demand not just for their physical beauty, but for their ""resilience"" too. Goi was born in Juba but as a child she moved to neighbouring Uganda, like Akol and hundreds of thousands of other South Sudanese. Many fled in the years after 2011, when South Sudan became independent from Sudan. There were high hopes for the world's newest nation, but just two years later a civil war erupted, during which 400,000 people were killed and 2.5 million fled their homes for places like Uganda. Although the civil war ended after five years, further waves of violence, natural disasters and poverty mean people continue to leave. Recently, fighting between government and opposition forces has escalated - sparking fears the country will return to civil war. After leaving a war-weary South Sudan for Uganda, Goi's ""biggest dream"" was to become a model. Fantasy became reality just last year, when she was scouted by agents via Facebook. For her very first job, she walked for Italian fashion giant Roberto Cavalli. ""I was super excited and ready for my first season... I was really nervous and scared but I said to myself: 'I can make it' - because it was a dream,"" Goi says, speaking to the BBC from Milan, having flown out for a job at the last minute. But some South Sudanese models have had more tumultuous journeys.  An investigation by British newspaper the Times found that two refugees living in a camp in Kenya were flown to Europe only to be told they were too malnourished to appear on the runway.  After completing modelling jobs, several others were informed that they owed their agencies thousands of euros - as some contracts specify that visas and flights are  to be repaid, usually once the models start earning money. Akol says she encountered a similar issue. When she was scouted in 2019, the agency in question asked her to fork out for numerous fees - fees which she now knows agencies do not normally request. ""I was asked for money for registration, money for this, for that. I couldn't manage all that. I'm struggling, my family is struggling, so I can't manage all that,"" she says. Three years later, while living in Uganda, she was eventually scouted by a more reputable agency. Deng, who helps fledgling South Sudanese models produce portfolios, tells the BBC that some have complained about being paid for jobs in clothes, rather than money. Many models also come up against another challenge - their family's perception of their career choice. ""They didn't want it and they don't want it now,"" Akol, who now lives in London, says of her own relatives. ""But we [models] managed to come up and say: 'We are [a] young country. We need to go out there and meet people. We need to do things that everyone else is doing.'"" Deng says those living in urban areas have become more open-minded, but some South Sudanese liken modelling to prostitution. Parents question the whole concept - wondering why their daughters would be ""walking in front of people"", he says. Deng recalls a young woman he was assisting who was about to fly out for her first international job. Unhappy that she would be modelling, the woman's family followed her to the airport and prevented her from getting on the plane. But, Deng says, the woman's relatives eventually came around and she has since modelled for a top lingerie brand. ""This girl is actually the breadwinner of the family. She's taking all her siblings to school and nobody talks about it as a bad thing any more,"" he says. He is ""proud"" to see this model - and others from South Sudan - on the global stage and although the industry cycles through trends, Deng does not believe South Sudanese models will go out of fashion. Goi agrees, saying there is an ""increasing demand for diversity"" in fashion. Akol too believes South Sudan is here to stay, stating: ""Alek Wek has been doing it before I was born and she is still doing it now. ""South Sudanese models are going to go a long way.""

6/7/2025,Article,News,India central bank delivers sharp rate cut as growth and inflation fall,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62vdq6g945o,"India's central bank has lowered interest rates by a deeper-than-expected half a percent - the third cut in a row amid falling inflation and lower growth in Asia's third largest economy.  It also increased the amount of liquidity - or supply of money - available in the system.  The repo rate - the level at which the central bank lends money to commercial banks, influencing borrowing costs for home and car loans - now stands at 5.5%, the lowest in three years. Explaining the rationale for the cut, RBI governor Sanjay Malhotra said growth is  ""lower than our aspirations"" and the bank felt it was ""imperative to stimulate domestic consumption and investment"" amid rising global uncertainties. The rate cut comes on the back of two previous reductions in April and February. Data released last week showed that India's economy grew by 6.5% in the previous financial year ending March. The country remains the world's fastest expanding major economy, although growth has sharply dropped from the 9.2% high recorded in financial year 2023-24. Meanwhile, retail prices in India have slowed faster than expected to 3.16% in April - the lowest in six years - and below the RBI's 4% target, driven down by falling food prices. RBI has now forecast lower inflation than earlier projected for the year ahead. But the central bank has changed its monetary policy stance from ""accommodative"" to ""neutral"", indicating that further rate cuts will depend on how India's growth-inflation dynamic evolves. However, fuller granaries due to a better-than-expected monsoon, weaker prices of commodities like oil - of which India is a net importer - as well as a strong currency are likely to help keep India's inflation in check in the months ahead, allowing the RBI to keep rates low. Lower borrowing costs could have a positive growth impact due to improved purchasing power for households, lower input costs for companies and lower debt servicing costs for the government. They will also help homebuyers and a struggling real estate sector. ""This effectively lowers the cost of borrowing, making home loan EMIs [mortgage payments] easier on the pocket and thereby directly improving affordability for buyers. This can potentially boost demand in the Indian real estate sector, especially in affordable and mid-income segments. Affordable housing faced the sharpest pandemic fallout, with sales and new launches shrinking in the top 7 cities,"" Anuj Puri, chairman of ANAROCK Group, said.  Indian markets rallied sharply post the rate cut announcement.  Copyright 2025 BBC.

6/7/2025,Article,News,"Millions more to get test results via NHS app, government says",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g6y48080zo,"The NHS app will become the default method of communication for millions more patients in England and save the health service £200m over the next three years, the government has said. More test results, screening invitations and appointment reminders will be sent directly to smartphones as part of a £50m investment in the app, in a move away from traditional communication methods such as letters. It is estimated that at least 50 million letters are sent to patients each year. The Department of Health and Social Care said that people who cannot access app messaging - including elderly patients - will receive text messages and then a letter as a last resort, and NHS phone lines would be freed up. The department says 270 million messages will be sent through the NHS app this financial year - an increase of 70 million on the previous year. Push notifications will provide appointment reminders to patients to try to reduce the risk of no attendance - with around eight million missed appointments in elective care missed in 2023/24. Work is also under way to enable users of the app to add appointments to their phone calendars and request help from their local GP surgeries. Figures show that more than 11 million people in the UK log into the NHS app every month, while almost 20 million are opted in to receive healthcare messages from the app. It is hoped the changes will give patients better access to manage their healthcare journey and make informed decisions about their care. NHS app services, which were launched in December 2018, are now used in 87% of hospitals across England. Health Secretary Wes Streeting said further investment in the app would bring the NHS into the digital age so that being a patient was as ""convenient as online banking or ordering a takeaway"".  He added that moving away from paper communication could free up funding for front line services. Rachel Power, chief executive of the Patient's Association, said the upgrade was a ""significant step in modernising how patients receive information"".  Prof Phil Banfield, chair of the British Medical Association (BMA) council, said the move to a digital-first approach ""must not discriminate against or alienate those many patients who cannot use or do not have access to digital technology such as tablets and smartphones"". He added: ""We must guard against creating a a situation in which patients who are vulnerable, elderly and possibly without access to digital communication are forgotten and left behind – as they already are in society. "" The announcement follows measures unveiled by the government in January that it planned to allow more patients in England to book treatments and appointments through the app. And last month, NHS England announced millions of patients would be able to get ""Amazon-style"" tracking updates on their prescriptions through the app, to check if their medicines are ready to collect or have been despatched for delivery.

6/7/2025,Article,Future,Why is lung cancer rising in non-smokers?,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20250605-the-mystery-rise-of-lung-cancer-in-non-smokers,"The number of lung cancer cases in people who have never smoked is increasing. The disease is different from lung cancer caused by smoking, so what causes it? Martha first realised that something was wrong when her cough changed and the mucus in her airways became increasingly viscous. Her doctors put it down to a rare disorder she had that caused her lungs to become chronically inflamed. ""No worry, it must be that,"" she was told. When she finally had an X-ray, a shadow was detected on her lung. ""That set the ball rolling,"" Martha recalls. ""First, a CT scan was done, then a bronchoscopy [a procedure that involves using a long tube to inspect the airways in a person's lungs] to take tissue samples."" After the tumour was removed, about four months after she'd first reported symptoms to her GP, she received the diagnosis: Stage IIIA lung cancer. The tumour had infiltrated the surrounding lymph nodes but had not yet spread to distant organs. Martha was 59 years old. ""It was a total shock,"" says Martha. Although she would occasionally light up a cigarette at a party, she never considered herself a smoker. Lung cancer is the most common cancer worldwide and the leading cause of cancer death. In 2022, about 2.5 million people were diagnosed with the disease and more than 1.8 million died. Although tobacco-related lung cancers still account for the majority of diagnoses worldwide, smoking rates have been declining for several decades. As the number of smokers continues to fall in many countries around the world, the proportion of lung cancer occurring in people who have never smoked is on the rise. Between 10 and 20% of lung cancer diagnoses are now made in individuals who have never smoked. ""Lung cancer in never-smokers is emerging as a separate disease entity with distinct molecular characteristics that directly impact treatment decisions and outcomes,"" says Andreas Wicki, an oncologist at the University Hospital Zurich, Switzerland. While the average age at diagnosis is similar to that of smoking-related lung cancers, younger patients with lung cancer are more likely to have never smoked. ""When we see 30- or 35-year-olds with lung cancer, they are usually never-smokers,"" he says. Another difference is the type of cancer being diagnosed. Until the 1950s and 1960s, the most common form of lung cancer was squamous cell carcinoma – a type which begins with the cells that line the lungs. In contrast, lung cancer in never-smokers is almost exclusively adenocarcinoma – a type which starts in mucus-producing cells – which is now the most common form of lung cancer in both smokers and never-smokers. Like other forms of lung cancer, adenocarcinoma is usually diagnosed at an advanced stage. ""If there's a 1cm (0.4in) tumour hidden somewhere in your lungs, you won't notice it,"" says Wicki. The early symptoms, which include persistent coughing, chest pain, shortness of breath or wheezing, often only appear when the tumour is larger or has spread. In addition, the historically strong link between smoking and lung cancer may inadvertently lead non-smokers to attribute symptoms to other causes, says Wicki. ""Most cases in never-smokers are therefore only diagnosed at stage 3 or 4."" Lung cancer in never-smokers is also more common in women. Women who have never smoked are more than twice as likely to develop lung cancer as male never-smokers. Aside from lung anatomy and environmental exposures, at least part of the answer may lie in genetic mutations that are more common in women, especially in Asian women. One of the most prevalent is a mutation known as EGFR. Lung cancer cells in people who have never smoked usually have a number of mutations that could be causing their cancer, explains Wicki – so-called driver mutations. These genetic changes drive tumour growth, such as the EGFR gene which codes for a protein on the surface of cells and is called epidermal growth factor receptor. The reasons why these driver mutations are more frequently found in female patients, particularly those of Asian descent, are not entirely understood. There is some evidence that female hormones may play a role, with certain genetic variants that affect oestrogen metabolism being more prevalent in East Asians. This could potentially explain the higher incidence of EGFR-mutant lung cancer in Asian women, although the data is very preliminary. Following the discovery of mutations which can lead to lung cancer in non-smokers, the pharmaceutical industry began to develop drugs that specifically block the activity of those proteins. For example, the first EGFR inhibitors became available around 20 years ago and most patients showed an impressive response. However, treatment often led to resistant cancer cells, resulting in tumour relapse. In recent years, much effort has been put into overcoming this problem, with newer types of drugs now entering the market.  As a result, the prognosis for patients has steadily improved. ""The median survival rate of patients who carry such driver mutations is now several years,"" Wicki explains. ""We have patients who have been on targeted therapy for more than 10 years. This is a huge step forward when you consider that the median survival rate was less than 12 months about 20 years ago.""  As the proportion of lung cancer in never-smokers increases, experts say it is crucial to develop prevention strategies for this population. A number of risk factors have been implicated. For example, studies have revealed that radon and second-hand smoke can elevate the risk of lung cancer in non-smokers. Additionally, exposure to cooking fumes or to stoves burning wood or coal in poorly ventilated rooms may also increase this risk. Since women traditionally spend more time indoors, they are particularly vulnerable to this type of indoor air pollution. However, outdoor air pollution is an even more significant factor in the development of lung cancer. In fact, outdoor air pollution is the second leading cause of all lung cancer cases after smoking. Studies have revealed that people who live in highly polluted areas are more likely to die of lung cancer than those who do not. Particulate matter less than 2.5 microns in diameter (about a 30th of the width of a human hair), typically found in vehicle exhaust and fossil fuel smoke, seems to play an important role. And intriguingly,  research has shown a strong link between high levels of PM2.5 and lung cancer in individuals who have never smoked and who carry an EGFR mutation. How air pollution may trigger lung cancer in never-smokers carrying the EGFR mutation has been the focus of research at the Francis Crick Institute in London. ""When we think about environmental carcinogens, we usually think about them as causing mutations in the DNA"", says William Hill, a post-doctoral researcher in the cancer evolution and genome instability laboratory of the Francis Crick Institute. Cigarette smoke, for example, damages our DNA, thus leading to lung cancer. ""However, our [2023] study proposes that PM2.5 doesn't directly mutate DNA, rather it wakes up dormant mutant cells sitting in our lungs and starts them on the early stages of lung cancer."" In their experiments, the researchers showed that air pollutants are taken up by immune cells called macrophages. These cells normally protect the lung by ingesting infectious organisms. In response to PM2.5 exposure, macrophages release chemical messengers known as cytokines, which wake up cells carrying the EGFR mutation and causes them to proliferate. ""Both air pollution and EGFR mutations are needed for tumours to grow,"" says Hill. Understanding how PM2.5 acts on the microenvironment of cells carrying EGFR mutations to promote tumour growth, he adds, could pave the way for new approaches to preventing lung cancer.  The association between air pollution and lung cancer is not new. In a landmark paper establishing the link between smoking and lung cancer in 1950, the authors suggested outdoor pollutants from the burning of fossil fuels as a possible cause. But policies to date have focused almost exclusively on tobacco control. But 75 years later, air pollution is finally coming into focus. Air pollution levels in Europe and the US have fallen in recent decades. But the effect of changes on lung cancer rates has not yet become apparent. ""It probably takes 15 to 20 years for changes in exposure to be reflected in lung cancer rates, but we don't know for sure,"" says Christine Berg, a retired oncologist from the National Cancer Institute in Maryland, US. Moreover, the picture is not static: climate change is likely to have an impact in the future. ""With the increasing risk of wildfires, air pollution and PM2.5 levels are rising again in certain regions of the US,"" says Berg. ""At least one study has shown an association between wildfire exposure and increased incidence of lung cancer. Transitioning away from coal, oil and gas is therefore crucial not only to slow global warming but also to improve air quality."" In 2021, the WHO halved the annual mean air quality guideline for PM2.5, meaning it has adopted a more stringent approach to particulate matter. ""But 99% of the world population lives in areas where air pollution levels exceed [these updated] WHO guideline limits,"" says Ganfeng Luo, a postdoctoral researcher at the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) in Lyon, France.  In a recent study, IARC researchers estimated that approximately 194,000 cases of lung adenocarcinoma worldwide were attributable to PM2.5 in 2022. ""The highest burden is estimated in East Asia, especially in China,"" says Luo. In the future, the number of lung cancer deaths attributable to air pollution could increase in countries such as India, which currently has some of the highest levels of air pollution, according to the WHO. In Delhi, the average PM2.5 levels are above 100 micrograms per sq m, which is 20 times above the WHO air quality guidelines. In the UK, 1,100 people developed adenocarcinoma of the lung as a result of air pollution in 2022, the IARC study found. ""But not all of these cases will be in never-smokers,"" says Harriet Rumgay, an epidemiologist and a co-author of the study. Adenocarcinoma also occurs in smokers, especially in those using filtered cigarettes. ""There's still a lot we don't know,"" says Rumgay. ""More research is needed to disentangle the different factors and also to understand, for example, how long you would need to be exposed to air pollution before developing lung cancer.""  As treatments continue to improve, lung cancer in never-smokers is becoming more survivable. It is conceivable that this type of lung cancer will one day become the most common form of a disease that has historically been associated with older male smokers, changing the way we think about the disease in popular culture; ""…the idea that they [patients] are at least partly to blame for their disease is unfortunately still widespread,"" says Wicki. Martha was found to have an EGFR mutation and has been taking an inhibitor since her diagnosis almost three years ago. ""It's definitely not a vitamin pill,"" she says. The drug has some nasty side effects: chronic fatigue, muscle pain, skin problems. Balancing the risks and benefits of drug treatment and maintaining a reasonable quality of life is not always easy, she says. But the drug is working.  ""And the fatalistic view of the disease is changing, and that is good."" --  For trusted insights into better health and wellbeing rooted in science, sign up to the Health Fix newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights.

6/7/2025,Article,News,Secret Glastonbury: The mystery of the festival's surprise stars,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg5zd3nkkwo,"After the full Glastonbury timetable was published this week, one band's name was on everybody's lips. Except no-one knows who they actually are. Patchwork have a prime place on the festival's line-up - third from the top of the bill on the main Pyramid Stage on the Saturday night. The only thing is, there's no band called Patchwork. It's a fake name for a mystery guest - just as an unknown band called The ChurnUps were on the Pyramid bill in 2023, and turned out to be the Foo Fighters. Fans immediately went into overdrive to try to work out Patchwork's identity - part of the frenzied guessing game surrounding the festival's ""surprise"" sets. The main theories include: In conclusion: I don't know. ""Radiohead also are in the mix of rumours because they've been teasing some tour action,"" suggests music journalist and broadcaster Georgie Rogers, who was a judge for Glastonbury's emerging talent competition this year and is DJing at the festival. ""Or could Elton John be returning to do something with Brandi Carlile?""  Sir Elton headlined in 2023, and Carlile, his collaborator on his last album, is on the Pyramid Stage bill on the same day as Patchwork. The Patchwork slot is just one of several tantalising gaps in this year's schedule. Another mystery Pyramid performer is listed as ""TBA"" for Friday afternoon, while the smaller Park and Woodsies stages - which have hosted secret sets by big names in the past - each have an empty space on the line-up. ""They're quite prominent sets, and they do tend to put in massive artists,"" says Rogers. One group of fans think they know who will fill those gaps. ""Of the four main slots, I think we've got three of them, maybe four, nailed down,"" says Ad, one of the people behind the Secretglasto social media account. ""I think it's definitely people who have got relationships with the festival who will be doing the big slots. An emotional return for one or two, I think. Some unfinished business."" Ad doesn't say any more, but that could point to Lewis Capaldi, who struggled to finish his set in 2023 before announcing a break from touring to get his ""mental and physical health in order"". He made a tentative comeback last month, and would be a popular choice. Lana Del Rey also has unfinished business - her 2023 set was cut short after she breached the curfew. She's back on tour in the UK, with free days on the Friday and Sunday of Glastonbury weekend. Other stars who have been rumoured include Lady Gaga, who hasn't played Glastonbury since 2009. Asked earlier this year what it would take for her to return to the festival, she replied: ""Not much"". Gaga has already played Coachella and been on tour this year. Lorde isn't on the bill either, but told BBC Radio 2's Jo Whiley this week she's ""pretty keen"" to be. ""The album's gonna be coming out right around that time,"" she said. ""I am quite tempted by what's going on because I've got lots of friends playing as well. We'll see if I can pull some strings and get there."" The Secretglasto team have gathered and posted information about surprise sets for more than a decade, and interest in their tips has gone ""a bit crazy"" in recent years. Ad - who doesn't want to give his full name - says they have built up a network of reliable sources. ""We've got loads of contacts at different stages and record labels and whatever else. And people trust us to be sensible with the information,"" he says. ""And the bands themselves don't want empty secret sets do they? So we have had occasions where they have come to us."" The six people who work on the account aren't music industry insiders themselves. Another team member, JB, says they sometimes approach acts directly to seek confirmation. ""Now that we've been around for 10 years and have a decent bit of clout, we will contact some of the artists via their inboxes, and quite often they're happy to confirm. ""Sometimes they don't. Sometimes they block us. But generally we're able to piece all that together fairly quickly."" He adds: ""By the time the gates open, there aren't many things we don't know."" In the past couple of years, some acts have begun harnessing the buzz about secret sets for PR purposes for their album or tour, Ad believes. ""It used to just be friends of the festival, whereas now people are like, 'If we do the secret set we're going to get loads of hype and media attention'."" Ad was among the lucky few to see Lady Gaga play an after-hours set in Club Dada following her main appearance as her career was taking off in 2009. ""She did three or four hits and then disappeared,"" he recalls. ""Because the phone signal was so bad, you couldn't ring or text your mate to let them know. So only the people who happened to be there got to experience it, which was a few hundred. ""I'm surprised she hasn't come back. Yet."" That was one of the more exclusive secret sets in Glastonbury history. Others draw huge crowds when the word gets out - which it usually does. Rogers was in the right place when a rumour swept the site that Radiohead would play in 2011. ""We were over that side of the festival anyway, so on a wing and a prayer, just in case it was true, we dashed over to the Park Stage in good time, and we got pretty close to the stage,"" she says. ""There are reports that it was the biggest crowd on the Park Stage for a secret set ever. I'd waited my whole life to see Radiohead live, and then suddenly here we are, and they did this amazing set. ""As my first ever time seeing them, and being in prime position, and it being a genuine surprise - it was just pure glee. I was just so happy, and I couldn't believe it."" Secret sets have been a feature of the festival for decades. In 1992, the line-up poster wasn't topped by a star name but the promise of ""a special guest that we can't announce"". That turned out to be Welsh pop stallion Tom Jones. But Glastonbury's greatest ever secret set didn't happen at the festival at all. In 1995, indie gods The Stone Roses pulled out of headlining after guitarist John Squire broke his collarbone. But by the time organiser Michael Eavis threw his annual low-key autumn gig in the local village to thank residents for putting up with the main event, Squire was back in action. So the band made an unannounced live comeback after a five-year absence in a marquee on a Somerset playing field to a couple of thousand lucky people. They still haven't appeared at the festival itself, however. Unfinished business? Tick. Emotional return? Tick! Could Patchwork in fact be The Stone Roses making a long-awaited and triumphant appearance? Who cares if the likelihood rating is -100/10. Add them to the list! Copyright 2025 BBC.

6/7/2025,Article,Culture,Five works that reveal Banksy's hidden philosophy,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20250602-five-works-that-reveal-the-philosophy-of-banksy,"Banksy's new mural in Marseille is not the first image he has connected to the history of ideas. From Plato to Foucault, a Banksy expert reveals the philosophy behind these popular artworks. Which is the real you, the person you are now or the one you are capable of becoming? It's a heady question, to be sure, and not one you would expect to be confronted with while strolling down a street in Marseille in the waning days of May. Yet it's precisely the existential dilemma that Banksy, who once asserted ""being yourself is overrated"" – has surreptitiously installed in a cloistered stretch of the quiet Rue Félix Fregier, the site of a new work – the latest installment in the elusive artist's decades-long career as a provocative philosophical prankster.  For more than 30 years, Banksy has spiked many of his most iconic works – from his girl reaching hopelessly for a heart-shaped balloon to his masked rioter hurling a bouquet of flowers – with barbed allusions to Old Masters, from Michelangelo to Monet, Vermeer to Van Gogh. But there's more. Beneath his stealthy stencils lies a deep and deliberate engagement with the history of ideas as well, from classical Stoicism to postmodern deconstructionism. On 29 May, Banksy posted on Instagram a photo of his first new piece in more than five months, piquing the internet's interest by withholding its precise location. Discovered shortly thereafter in the major port city in southern France, Marseille, the mural is, at first glance, deceptively simple: a tall silhouette of a lighthouse spray-painted on to a blank beige urban wall; a rusting street bollard positioned nearby; and a painted shadow stretching across the pavement, joining the real-world object to its augmented, if two-dimensional, echo. Stencilled across the black lighthouse are the words: ""I want to be what you saw in me.""  Anyone keen to find a source for the ideas that inform Banksy's new work needs merely to flip open any history of philosophy to Plato's seminal allegory of the cave (from the Fourth-Century BC treatise The Republic), then flip the ancient metaphor on its head. In Plato's parable, prisoners chained inside a cave mistake shadows on the wall for reality, unaware of the truer forms that cast them outside. But here, Banksy, being Banksy, baits us by switching the set-up, reversing the relationship between essence and shadow. In Banksy's mural, the drab bollard casts not a diminished imitation of itself, but something far grander – a lighthouse, a symbol of illumination and guidance. Here, it's the silhouette, not reality, that's true. Banksy's inversion urges us to ask where reality really resides: in what is, or in what might be? His poignant phrase – ""I want to be what you saw in me"" – is alluringly elastic. Is this the bollard dreaming of being more than it appears? Or the shadow wishing to become light? Or is it all of us – Banksy included – struggling to live up to the better versions imagined by those who believe in us? The answer is surely yes to all of the above. And it's a yes too to the question: 'is this new work a lamp capable of shining light on further levels of meaning in Banksy?' What follows is a brief look back at some of the artist's best-known works and how they too are invigorated by, and often upend, many of the most important philosophical tenets – both social and intellectual – that underwrite who we are and who we might be. Banksy's new mural in Marseille is not the first to be accompanied by an affecting caption connecting the piece to the history of ideas. Among his most famous murals, Girl with Balloon, which portrays a child reaching towards a heart-shaped balloon drifting away from her, first appeared in 2002 in various locations in London, including on the South Bank, alongside the consoling assertion, ""there is always hope"". That conviction, which fuels the ceaseless striving for an ideal that is seemingly unobtainable in the mural (there's no way that balloon is coming back) rhymes richly with aspects of 19th-Century German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer's ideas concerning an unquenchable and irrational ""Will"" as a fundamental force that drives humanity. When, years later, Banksy mischievously concealed a remote-controlled shredder in the frame of a version of Girl with Balloon that came up for auction in 2018, and sensationally destroyed the work before the eyes of aghast auction-goers, he succeeded in upping the ante on Schopenhauer's belief in the futility of desire by boldly manifesting it himself. Where there's a will there's a fray. Banksy's famous mural of a masked man frozen forever in the instant before he unleashes not a brick or a bomb but a bouquet of flowers may seem, at first blush, to exemplify a pacifist's commitment to peaceful disobedience. The work appears to echo the precepts of Mahatma Gandhi's Satyagraha – a philosophy of non-violence that the Indian ethicist coined in 1919. Banksy's fully flexed figure, incongruously armed with a fistful of beauty, appears to epitomise Gandhi's insistence on wielding moral, not physical, strength. Doesn't it? Or has Banksy slyly subverted the philosophical assertion of pacifistic force by portraying his hero as an enraged rioter? The figure's anger has not been tempered by an appeal to the higher ideals of beauty and truth. Instead, those ideals have been weaponised by Banksy. Here, beauty and truth are not disarming, they are devastatingly explosive. Banksy's mural in Marseille employs a tried-and-true technique to ensure the work protrudes into the urban space in which we'll encounter it – elevating its philosophical potential from something flimsy and flat to something undeniably urgent. It's a tactic he used in a 2007 work that appeared near London's Oxford Street in which he depicts a boy atop a precariously high ladder, spray-painting the penetrating observation that we are ""One Nation Under CCTV"" in outlandishly outsized letters. Also portrayed within the mural is a uniformed officer and his obedient police dog who surveil the young vandal, while above them all an actual CCTV camera, presumably recording everything, juts out from the wall. The endless layers of surveillance-within-surveillance to which the work attests – as we watch the state watch an officer watch the boy – captures with uncanny precision the philosophical contours of the vast and all-encompassing prison machine in which the French poststructural philosopher Michel Foucault believed everyone in society was now irredeemably enmeshed. In Foucault's study Discipline and Punish: The Birth of the Prison, he resuscitates a blueprint for a prison proposed by the British utilitarian philosopher Jeremy Bentham at the end of the 18th Century, ""The Panopticon"" (meaning ""all seeing""), and uses it as a menacing metaphor for how no one can escape the perniciously penetrating eye of the panoptical state.  Banksy's witty 2014 work Mobile Lovers shines a chilling light on the state of contemporary relationships. The mural depicts a couple whose almost affectionate embrace is interrupted by the deeper fondness they have for the warm glow of their smartphones. The French existentialist philosopher Simone de Beauvoir, who died in 1986, may not have lived long enough to witness the emergence of mobiles. Yet her profoundly influential 1947 book The Ethics of Ambiguity – published exactly 60 years before the iPhone was launched in 2007 – with its exploration of the devastation that detachment and disconnection can wreak on the realisation of our truest selves, is profoundly proleptic of our modern predicament. To be free, de Beauvoir insisted, requires a deep attentiveness to each other. She believed in the authenticity of human encounters, without which life is a futile performance, dimly lit by disposable devices, rather than something profound and meaningful.  How Banksy Saved Art History by Kelly Grovier, published by Thames & Hudson, is out now. -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.

6/7/2025,Article,Travel,How WW2 changed the French diet,https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20250605-how-world-war-two-changed-the-french-diet,"More than 80 years after D-Day, the recipes and ingredients introduced during France's wartime occupation are slowly making a comeback. By June 1940, German forces had blitzed through France in just six weeks, leading more than half of the country to be occupied. As a result, French staples like cheese, bread and meat were soon rationed, and by 1942 some citizens were living on as few as 1,110 calories per day. Even after World War Two ended in 1945, access to food in France would continue to be regulated by the government until 1949. Such austerity certainly had an impact on how the French ate during and just after the war. Yet, more than 80 years after Allied forces landed in Normandy to begin liberating the nation on D-Day (6 June 1944), few visitors realise that France's wartime occupation still echoes across the nation's culinary landscape. In the decades following WW2, the French abandoned the staples that had got them through the tough times of occupation; familiar ingredients like root vegetables and even hearty pain de campagne (country bread) were so eschewed they were nearly forgotten. But as wartime associations have slowly faded from memory, a bevy of younger chefs and tastemakers are reviving the foods that once kept the French alive. There aren't many French residents old enough to vividly recall life in wartime France today, and fewer still would deign to discuss it. Author Kitty Morse only discovered her great-grandparents' ""Occupation diary and recipe book"" after her own mother's death. Morse released them in 2022 in her book Bitter Sweet: A Wartime Journal and Heirloom Recipes from Occupied France. ""My mother never said any of this to me,"" she said. BBC.com's World's Table ""smashes the kitchen ceiling"" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future. Aline Pla was just nine years old in 1945 but, raised by small-town grocers in the south of France, she remembers more than others might. ""You were only allowed a few grams of bread a day,"" she recalled. ""Some [people] stopped smoking – especially those with kids. They preferred trading for food."" Such widespread lack gave rise to ersatz replacements: saccharine stood in for sugar; butter was supplanted by lard or margarine; and instead of coffee, people brewed roots or grains, like acorns, chickpeas or the barley Pla recalls villagers roasting at home. While many of these wartime brews faded from fashion, chicory coffee remained a staple, at least in northern France. Ricoré – a blend of chicory and instant coffee – has been on supermarket shelves since the 1950s. More recently, brands like Cherico are reimagining it for a new generation, marketing it as a climate-conscious, healthful alternative traditional coffee. According to Patrick Rambourg, French culinary historian and author of Histoire de la Cuisine et de la Gastronomie Françaises, if chicory never wholly disappeared in France, it's in large part thanks to its flavour. ""Chicory tastes good,"" he explained. ""It doesn't necessarily make you think of periods of austerity."" Other products did, however, such as swedes and Jerusalem artichokes, which WW2 historian Fabrice Grenard asserted ""were more reserved for animals before the war."" The French were nevertheless forced to rely heavily on them once potato rationing began in November 1940, and after the war, these vegetables became almost ""taboo"", according to Rambourg. ""My mother never cooked a swede in her life,"" added Morse. Two generations later, however, Jerusalem artichokes, in particular, have surged to near-omnipresence in Paris, from the trendy small plates at Belleville wine bar Paloma to the classic chalkboard menu at bistro Le Bon Georges. Alongside parsnips, turnips and swedes, they're often self-awarely called ""les legumes oubliés""(""the forgotten vegetables"") and, according to Léo Giorgis, chef-owner of L'Almanach Montmartre, French chefs have been remembering them for about 15 years.  ""Now you see Jerusalem artichokes everywhere, [as well as] swedes [and] golden turnips,"" he said. As a chef dedicated to seasonal produce, Giorgis finds their return inspiring, especially in winter. ""Without them, we're kind of stuck with cabbages and butternut squash."" According to Apollonia Poilâne, the third generation of her family to run the eponymous bakery Poilâne, founded in 1932, a similar shift took place with French bread. Before the war, she explained, white baguettes, which weren't subject to the same imposed prices as sourdough, surged to popularity on a marketplace rife with competition.  But in August 1940, bread was one of the first products to be rationed, and soon, white bread was supplanted by darker-crumbed iterations bulked out with bran, chestnut, potato or buckwheat. The sale of fresh bread was forbidden by law, which some say was implemented specifically to reduce bread's palatability. ""I never knew white bread!"" said Pla. When one went to eat at a friend's home during wartime, she recalled, ""You brought your bread – your bread ration. Your own piece of bread.""  Hunger for white bread surged post-war – so much so that while Poilâne's founder, Pierre Poilâne, persisted in producing the sourdoughs he so loved, his refusal to bake more modern loaves saw him ejected from bakery syndicates, according to his granddaughter, Apollonia. These days, however, the trend has come full circle: Baguette consumption fell 25% from 2015 to 2025, but the popularity of so-called ""special"" breads made with whole or heirloom grains is on the rise. ""It's not bad that we're getting back to breads that are a bit less white,"" said Pla. For Grenard, however, the most lasting impact the war left on French food culture was a no-waste mindset. ""What remains after the war is more of a state of mind than culinary practices,"" he said. Rambourg agreed: ""You know the value of food when you don't have any."" The French were forced to get creative with what they had. In France's south-eastern Ardèche department, Clément Faugier rebranded its sweetened chestnut paste as Génovitine, a name whose medical consonance made it easier to market as a fortifier and even prescribe. In the coastal Camargue region, local samphire suddenly stood in for green beans. Morse's great-grandfather foraged for wild mushrooms in the nearby Vosges mountains, and in cities, those with balconies planted their window boxes with carrots or leeks. Paris' public Jardin des Tuileries was even transformed into collective kitchen gardens. According to Rambourg, this subsistence mindset ""would affect the entire generation that lived through the war, and our parents, because they were the children of our grandparents, who knew the war."" More like this: • How French winemakers outwitted the Nazis • The top-secret meeting that helped win D-Day • The French cocktail born from a banned spirit As the need for these subsistence methods dissipated, French cuisine underwent another period of change. In 1963, the country welcomed its first Carrefour hypermarket, and large-scale supermarkets soon supplanted small shops. According to Grenard, this was partly due to ""suspicion"" following corruption during the German occupation, when some grocers inflated prices far past the norm, just because they could . ""At the end of the war, consumers held real rancour against small shopkeepers,"" said Grenard. ""In a supermarket, the prices are fixed.""  Fast-forward eight decades, and some locals, now motivated by climate change are turning back to small, local grocers, such as the locavore Terroir d’Avenir shops dotting Paris. Others are reaching into the nation's past to resuscitate techniques like canning, preserving and foraging that saved many French residents during the war, according to Grenard. ""The people that got by the best were the ones who had reserves."" Today, filling the larder with foraged food has become popular once again. In Kaysersberg, Alsace, chef Jérôme Jaegle of Alchémille puts this ancestral knowledge centre-stage by offering wild harvesting workshops culminating in a multi-course meal. And in Milly-la-Forêt, just outside Paris, François Thévenon highlights the foraging techniques he learned from his grandmother with classes teaching others how to seek out these edible plants themselves. ""After the war"", he explained, ""people wanted to reassure themselves that they wouldn't lack anything anymore."" They turned, he said, to overconsumption, specifically of meat, which even his foraging grandmother ate every day, at every meal. ""You often hear when you ask older folk why they no longer eat wild plants, that it's because they don't have to,"" Thévenon said, who forages for wild plants because he believes it's good for his health and that of the planet. According to Apollonia, the war didn't only change how France eats. ""It probably changed the way the world eats,"" she asserted. Today, the techniques and philosophies that helped the French survive are slowly coming back to life. -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.  For more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.   Copyright 2025 BBC.

6/7/2025,Article,Travel,Eight rare juices you can only try in the Amazon,https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20250529-eight-rare-juices-you-can-only-try-in-the-amazon,"Far from smoothie bars and powdered sachets, these wild Amazonian juices are pulped just hours after picking – making them rich in flavour and cultural meaning. The Amazon is not only the world's largest and most biodiverse ecosystem – it's also one of the most delicious. Among the thousands of native species, around 220 trees are known to bear edible fruit, many of which never leave the jungle. Some are too delicate to export, while others are little known beyond the communities that have nurtured them for generations. But along the Amazon River and its tributaries – from Peru's misty highland jungle to the floodplains of northern Brazil – travellers can find market stalls and cafe counters brimming with thick, vibrant juices that capture the flavour of the forest. These are the fruits you're unlikely to find bottled or powdered at home, often pulped just hours after harvest, served chilled in the tropical heat and prized not only for their nutrients but for their rich textures and sharp tangs. Here are eight juices worth seeking out, whether for their bold flavours, cultural significance or the thrill of trying something new. On the eastern slopes of the Andes, where rivers cascade in dramatic waterfalls into the Amazon Basin, travellers will find the aguaje fruit of the Moriche palm. In the small Peruvian city of Tingo Maria, markets are piled high with silver trays of the armadillo-like fruit. Locals soak them in water for a day or two, before peeling the brown armour to reveal an intensely orange flesh. The pulp is soaked, mashed and transformed into aguajina – a thick and custardy drink that tastes like cross between pumpkin pie and flan. BBC.com's World's Table ""smashes the kitchen ceiling"" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future. Some locals say that the fruit contains oestrogen compounds and men should be careful of drinking too much of it, though there is little scientific evidence. ""The aguajina is very useful – for the bone, for the skin, for the complexion – especially for women,"" says Gianina Pujay, an aguajinera who sells the drink across from Tingo Maria's fruit market. In the same region, the cocona fruit, a tropical relative of the common tomato, yields a tangy juice that tastes like a pineapple-papaya hybrid with a thick, almost oily body.  ""Many Amazonian fruits are consumed in juice form because their pulp is acidic, fibrous or difficult to eat raw, like the cocona,"" explains Miluska Carrasco, a researcher and nutritionist at Peru's Instituto de Investigación Nutricional, ""It's also a practical way to use them quickly before they spoil."" Descending from the verdant slopes of the Andes into the Amazon Basin, the rivers slow down and transform into thoroughfares of commercial activity. On the banks of the Ucayali River is the river port city of Pucallpa, the furthest Peru's road system will take you into the centre of the Amazon. Here, where container barges, passenger ships and canoes all move goods around the forest, camu camu is a must-drink juice.  The small, tart, plum-like fruit tastes like a sour strawberry with a hint of peach, and is a favourite of local juice vendors. ""[It] has more vitamin C than oranges,"" says Carrasco, ""[as well as] other bioactive compounds."" Where a navel orange provides about 6mg of vitamin C per 100g, the camu camu contains more than 2,000mg for the same amount of flesh.  The season for camu camu is short, however, typically between January and March, so take advantage of the fresh juice when it's available. Locals also eat the little plums with salt; just spit out the seeds.  In the heart of Brazil's vast Amazonas state, 700 miles east of Pucallpa as the toucan flies (and at least a week or more on a river boat), tucumã palms provide an orange fruit that's only in season from February to August. During this time, it's often eaten for breakfast with cassava flour and is a key ingredient in the state's signature x-caboquinho sandwich, where slices are layered with salty coalho cheese and sweet chunks of fried plantains. To make juice from the notoriously fibrous tucumã, vendors use peelers, blenders and sieves to reduce shavings of the fruit to a pulp and then filter out the lightly nutty liquid. According to Francisco Falcão, a farmer in the community of Bom Jesus in the Tefé National Forest, ""people say that tucumã is good to eat and improves sight and skin"". Indeed, the fruit is rich in both manganese and calcium. Where kiwi, which is relatively high in calcium, contains around 30mg of calcium per 100g, tucumã has been measured to contain around four times as much. Also in the Tefé region, ""there's a palm tree that people eat the fruit of,"" says Falcão. ""Pupunha is a plant that we harvest starting in December and ending February."" Spanish-speaking parts of the Amazon know this oily palm fruit as pejibaye or pijuayo, and it is a key source of natural fats as well as vitamin B1 and vitamin E.   The pupunha grow in clusters of orange and red acorn-shaped fruit. They cannot be eaten raw, but once boiled they make a filling snack akin to an oily sweet potato. The boiled fruits also produce a creamy orange juice once fully pulped. In Peru, forest communities ferment the pulp into a lightly alcoholic drink called chicha or masato – especially during times of harvest.    In Manaus, capital of the Amazonas, reliable refrigeration means locals and visitors can enjoy fruits in various forms. The thick shell of the cupuaçu contains a collection of seeds surrounded by a fleshy white pulp. That pulp can be transformed into silky, tangy juice. But lately, locals have been incorporating its juice into ice cream. Indeed, the rest of Brazil is catching on, with ice cream parlours in Rio de Janeiro now offering the flavour too. More like this: • Spain's 'white gold' super-drink • A decadent avocado smoothie to break the Ramadan fast • The Caribbean's cooling, healthy elixir for summer Cupuaçu tastes like a creamy pineapple – surprising given that it's a close relative of cacao. ""It's the same genus as cacao and people make cupulate [as opposed to chocolate from it],"" says Daniel Tregidgo, a researcher at Brazil's Mamirauá Institute for Sustainable Development. ""When you go to the markets there are huge piles of cupuaçu seeds. I look at that and I say that's hipster chocolate right there."" Why haven’t we heard of cupulate yet? In Tregidgo's opinion, ""It's a matter of investment. If you take something from the middle of Amazon and you try to get it out into the global market without being exploitative, it is a bit tricky."" Bars produced from cupuaçu have the flavour of chocolate but retain some of their citrus piquancy. In the Amazon delta, jenipapo is known for its traditional use as a blue dye and a temporary tattoo ink. The fruit itself, which grows all along Brazil's coast in addition to the Amazon, has a yellowish pulp that's a great source of vitamin B1 and zinc. While jenipapo can be consumed as a fresh juice that tastes a bit like dried apricots, try ordering licor de jenipapo, an infused cachaça liqueur served in small bars and botecos. While açaí has become a global wellness trend, the version served in the Amazon bears little resemblance to the frozen bowls found abroad. What many travellers don't realise is that there are seven distinct açaí palm species. Locals distinguish between açaí-do-Pará, açaí-do-mato and juçara, depending on region. In Belém, for example, vendors use pneumatic presses to extract the berry's thick, purplish pulp – sold in clear bags and consumed straight out of bowls with spoons, as if a purple gazpacho. Outside of its natural range in Brazil, the rest of the country enjoys the pulp prepared in yogurts and ice creams.  -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.  For more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.  Copyright 2025 BBC.

6/7/2025,Article,News,How warming seas are altering our underwater world,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62nk284j5po,"Beneath the surface of the ocean is a world filled with a vast array of fauna and flora  but scientists say ""somewhat unusual"" changes are taking place. Intensified by a marine heatwave in May, they say waters off the south coast of England are getting warmer and disrupting the food chain. ""I'm not a scientist or anything like that,"" said Cornish snorkeler and underwater photographer Heather Hamilton. ""But because I've been in the sea so much over the last 20-odd years, I have seen changes, especially in the last two years."" Ms Hamilton runs a blog and Instagram page documenting the different species she sees in Cornwall, including different species of jellyfish as well as increases in octopus numbers. She said the changes had also left her with a ""mixture of emotions"" from excitement to concern. ""You've got in the back of your mind, 'Is this a good thing?'"" she said. ""It's a little bit worrying to think why is this happening all of a sudden in the last few years?"" Ms Hamilton's observations in the sea are part of what marine ecologist Dr Bryce Stewart, from the Marine Biological Association in Plymouth, said were ""dramatic changes"" to the marine ecosystem. Dr Stewart, who helped create the latest Sir David Attenborough documentary, said he was ""very confident"" changes in the marine environment were being caused by the warming of the oceans. In recent months he said there had been some ""somewhat unusual"" changes off the coast of Devon and Cornwall, where a marine heatwave was most intense in May. Fishermen have reported an ""invasion"" of octopus which is ""decimating"" the Devon shellfish industry. The octopus, usually found in the Mediterranean, are being increasingly found in lobster and crab pots off the coastline. It is thought the octopuses are coming from Morocco, as fishermen there are reporting a shortage of the creatures. Dr Stewart said: ""So there's a lot of species either turning up that we haven't had before or increasing abundance... and then of course we have other species that were more adapted to cooler water decreasing in abundance... and we see those changes right from the base of the food chain in the plankton to right to the top, to the tuna and sharks."" He said the number of blue sharks off the south coast of England was currently the highest anglers had ever seen. ""We've been working with anglers, and they have datasets going back to the 1950s about their catch rates of blue sharks, they all let them go so don't worry about that, but the numbers now are the highest we've ever seen,"" he said. Dr Stewart said changes were happening in the ocean ""more dramatically"" than anyone had predicted. Dr Stewart said a trip off the coast of Falmouth a couple of years ago was ""one of the greatest days at sea"" he had ever had – having travelled all over the world. During the trip, he saw two fin whales, ""thousands of dolphins"", and also snorkelled with blue sharks. The fin whale is the second-largest species of whale. Dr Stewart added: ""It's the biggest creature I have ever seen, we estimated probably 70ft long, which is enormous right? ""These things are now just off the coast, and I would encourage as many people as possible to go out and see them."" The Devon Wildlife Trust said it was seeing changes closer to the shore, including colourful species of sea slugs. Carli Cocciardi, marine nature recovery officer at the trust, said one citizen science project involved surveying rock pools at Wembury beach, in the South Hams, on a monthly basis.  ""That gives us a good indication of what changes year-on-year and month-on-month,"" she said. ""So for example, what we're seeing more in Wembury is... furrowed crabs, and sometimes hermit crabs - and those are more Mediterranean species, that are seen here more and more often."" This spring has been the second sunniest spring on record.  With sunshine levels high, and the vertical mixing of water limited by the predominance of easterly and north-easterly winds, a marine heatwave was recorded in the waters to the west of Ireland and through the Irish and Celtic seas in mid-May The phenomenon is defined as sea temperatures which exceed the seasonal threshold for more than five consecutive days.  In the UK the marine heatwave threshold for May is 11.3C (52.34F). On 19 May, the average sea surface temperature reached 12.69C (54.84F). For Ms Hamilton, the sea is a ""very special place"" and growing up in the Isles of Scilly meant it was ""kind of inevitable"" she would be captivated by the ocean. ""Going in the sea and snorkelling is kind of like an escape from the world above, you're kind of putting your head under the water and you forget about all your worries in life,"" she said. ""It's just very calming and peaceful."" Dr Stewart said if people engaged with marine environment more, they would be more likely to become passionate about protecting it. ""I'm going to echo the recent Ocean with David Attenborough film here,"" he said. ""What that showed us and what I've seen as well in my own research is that when we look after the marine environment, it has an amazing ability to bounce back.""

6/8/2025,Article,News,Trump's intervention in LA is a political fight he is eager to have,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/c628vwq9z9zo,"On the campaign trail last year, Donald Trump promised that he was not going to tolerate left-wing lawlessness on American streets and would use the full force of his presidential powers in response. The protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) efforts in California on Saturday night gave him an opening to follow through on that promise.  Never mind that the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) said that the protests were largely peaceful, or that local authorities said they could handle the clashes that did turn violent. Trump administration officials said that immigration agents were being targeted and injured – and that local law enforcement had been too slow to respond. ""Waiting several hours for LAPD to show up - or them telling us that they're not going to back us up until they have an officer in a dangerous situation - is something that just isn't workable when you have violent protests going on,"" Homeland Security Secretary Kirsty Noem told CBS News on Sunday morning. The LAPD said it ""acted as swiftly as conditions safely allowed"" and began dispersing crowds within 55 minutes of receiving the call. Over California Governor Gavin Newsom's objection, Trump federalised the 2,000 California National Guard soldiers, and Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth warned that US Marines were also on ""high alert"" to deploy – which would mark a rare use of the active duty military on US soil. By Sunday morning, Trump was declaring victory and thanking the National Guard for restoring peace, even though the guard had yet to fully assemble. The speed with which Trump reacted suggests that this is a fight his administration is prepared for – and even eager to have.  The White House believes that law and order, and aggressive immigration enforcement, are winning issues for him.  His actions will thrill his core base of supporters and could sway political independents concerned about public safety. Noem, in her interview, said the Black Lives Matters protests of 2020 in Minnesota were allowed to spread unchecked – and that the new Trump administration was going to handle things differently. ""We're not going to let a repeat of 2020 happen,"" she said. Democrats, however, have said the administration's use of masked immigration officers with military gear to arrest civilians in restaurants and shops has been inflammatory, and that the president's eagerness to deploy trained soldiers was unwarranted. ""For the president to do this when it wasn't requested, breaking with generations of tradition, is only going to incite the situation and make things worse,"" said New Jersey Senator Cory Booker.  ""A lot of these peaceful protests are being generated because the president of the United States is sowing chaos and confusion by arresting people who are showing up for their immigration hearings, who are trying to abide by the law."" The US has a long tradition of summer protests, and it is only early June.  Five months into Trump's second term, these California demonstrations may be an isolated event – or the start of greater civil unrest in the days ahead. Copyright 2025 BBC.

6/8/2025,Article,News,Activists say Israeli troops have boarded aid ship,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/c5y264x3nnno,"Activists say Israeli troops have boarded a yacht trying to bring humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip, in defiance of an Israeli naval blockade. ""Connection has been lost"" on the Madleen, the Freedom Flotilla Coalition (FFC) campaign group said on the Telegram app. It posted a photo showing people in life jackets sitting with their hands up.  Appearing to confirm that the ship had been boarded, Israel's foreign ministry said the yacht was ""safely making its way to the shores of Israel"" and its passengers were ""expected to return to their home countries"".  Climate activist Greta Thunberg is among those aboard the vessel, which was reported to be off the Egyptain coast.  Israel says its blockade is necessary to prevent weapons from reaching Hamas militants in Gaza.  After reporting that the yacht had been boarded, the FFC posted short, pre-recorded videos of some of the activists, including Thunberg.  In the footage, activists say ""if you see this video, we have been intercepted and kidnapped"" by the Israeli military or forces supporting Israel.  The FFC earlier said the vessel, which left Italy's island of Sicily on Friday, was carrying humanitarian aid and had been ""prepared for the possibility of an Israeli attack"". Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz had warned that the yacht should turn back and that Israel would act against any attempt to breach the blockade. He wrote in a post on X on Sunday: ""I have instructed the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] to act to prevent the 'Madeleine' [sic] hate flotilla from reaching the shores of Gaza - and to take whatever measures are necessary to that end."" Katz says the purpose of Israel's blockade, which has been in place since 2007, is to ""prevent the transfer of weapons to Hamas"" and is essential to Israel's security as it seeks to destroy Hamas.  The FFC has argued that the sea blockade is illegal, characterising Katz's statement as an example of Israel threatening the unlawful use of force against civilians and ""attempting to justify that violence with smears"". ""We will not be intimidated. The world is watching,"" FFC press officer Hay Sha Wiya said. ""The Madleen is a civilian vessel, unarmed and sailing in international waters, carrying humanitarian aid and human rights defenders from across the globe... Israel has no right to obstruct our effort to reach Gaza."" The Madleen is carrying a symbolic quantity of aid, including rice and baby formula, the group said. Citizens of Brazil, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and Turkey are onboard. In 2010, Israeli commandos killed 10 people when they boarded Turkish ship Mavi Marmara that was leading an aid flotilla towards Gaza. Israel recently began to allow limited aid into Gaza after a three-month land blockade, prioritising distribution through the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which is backed by Israel and the US but widely condemned by humanitarian groups. The UN's human rights chief, Volker Türk, said last week Palestinians were being presented with the ""grimmest of choices: die from starvation or risk being killed while trying to access the meagre food that is being made available"". But in a post on X early on Monday, the Israeli foreign ministry said: ""While Greta and others attempted to stage a media provocation whose sole purpose was to gain publicity - and which included less than a single truckload of aid - more than 1,200 aid trucks have entered Gaza from Israel within the past two weeks, and in addition, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation has distributed close to 11 million meals directly to civilians in Gaza. ""There are ways to deliver aid to the Gaza Strip - they do not involve Instagram selfies."" It is almost 20 months since Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza in response to the unprecedented Hamas-led cross-border attack on Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. At least 54,880 people have been killed in Gaza since, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Copyright 2025 BBC.

6/8/2025,Article,News,Brit Awards to leave London for Manchester after 48 years,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/cdxk7l58xjzo,"Next year's Brit Awards are to be held in Manchester - the first time the ceremony has taken place outside London since the awards began in 1977. The ceremony will be held at the Co-op Live arena on Saturday 28 February. A two-year deal means that the 2027 ceremony, which will celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Brit Awards, will also be held at the same venue. It is the second major music ceremony to announce plans to leave London. Last month the BPI, which represents the British music industry and runs the Brit Awards, also revealed that this year's Mercury Prize will be held in Newcastle in September after 32 years in the capital. Dr Jo Twist, CEO of the BPI, told the BBC: ""We've had a fantastic history in London for nearly 50 years, and we just feel that now is the time to make a bold leap into other parts of the UK to the fans. ""Manchester has such a rich musical heritage and it has a fantastic ecosystem of support there on the ground, including lots of amazing grassroots venues."" Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham described the move as ""a massive coup"" for the area. Hailing the city's ""unparalleled music heritage,"" Burnham said Manchester would ""pull out all the stops"" to prove the BPI had made the right decision. The past 15 Brit Award ceremonies have taken place at London's O2 Arena. This year's awards were dominated by Charli XCX, who won five including best artist, album and song of the year. Back in 1977, when the awards started, they were called The British Record Industry Britannia Awards. As part of the celebrations for the Queen's Silver Jubilee, they gave prizes to the best music released during her reign. Best album went to Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band by The Beatles. Best single was a tie between Procul Harum's A Whiter Shade of Pale and Bohemian Rhapsody by Queen, who turned up to accept the award from host Michael Aspel. The ceremony was held at the Wembley Conference Centre, which was demolished in 2006 and turned into flats. The Brit Awards became an annual event in 1982, taking place at the Grosvenor House Hotel and other London venues including the Royal Albert Hall, the Dominion Theatre, Hammersmith Apollo, Alexandra Palace, Earls Court Exhibition Centre and London Arena. Co-op Live has already held a major music award ceremony, the MTV Europe Music Awards (EMAs), in November last year, which attracted the likes of Teddy Swims, Benson Boone and Shawn Mendes. Britain's biggest indoor venue originally made headlines when its opening was delayed three times due to a series of highly-publicised problems. These included part of a ventilation system falling from the ceiling, an event the boss of Co-op Live Tim Leiweke said could have been ""catastrophic"". Since then, the venue has held the only UK shows on The Eagles' farewell tour, celebrated its first anniversary with three Bruce Springsteen gigs, and last November Charli XCX opened her Brat World Tour there. Manchester has a serious Brit Awards pedigree. Take That, who formed in the city, have won eight Brit Awards. Their former member Robbie Williams holds the record for the most Brit Award wins, with 18 including five while in the band. Simply Red, Elbow and The 1975 have all been named best group. M People were best dance act in 1995 and The Chemical Brothers, who met at the University of Manchester, won the same award in 2000. Two years ago, Aitch was named best hip hop, grime or rap act and in his acceptance speech said: ""Not many people from my side of Manchester get the opportunity to stand up here and receive such an amazing gift or award."" New Order, The Stone Roses, Happy Mondays, The Bee Gees, 10CC, Johnny Marr, Ian Brown, Doves, James, Blossoms and Badly Drawn Boy have all been nominated for Brit Awards over the years, but none of those acts have ever won. The Smiths, one of the most influential indie bands of all time, were never nominated at the Brits. One interesting potential storyline for 2026 is that if the Brit Awards were to bring back the best live act category (last presented in 2013 to Coldplay) then a possible winner might be one of the biggest Manchester bands of all time. Oasis will start their reunion tour in Cardiff on 4 July. The thought of the Gallagher brother picking up a Brit in their hometown, is one that would certainly help bring in audiences. Twist has a twinkle in her eye when she says: ""Our categories are always under review, so we will be looking at that. We're very excited to be part of that whole buzz."" It is exactly 30 years since Oasis won the first of their six Brit Awards - British breakthrough act, beating fellow nominees Echobelly, Eternal, Portishead and PJ & Duncan. Copyright 2025 BBC.

6/8/2025,Article,News,Italy citizenship referendum: 'I was born here - but feel rejected',https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/c780yk3z2lyo,"Sonny Olumati was born in Rome and has lived in Italy all his life but the country he calls home does not recognise him as its own. To Italy, Sonny is Nigerian, like his passport, and the 39-year-old is only welcome as long as his latest residence permit. ""I've been born here. I will live here. I will die here,"" the dancer and activist tells me in what he calls ""macaroni"" Italian-English beneath the palm trees of a scruffy Roman park. ""But not having citizenship is like... being rejected from your country. And I don't think this is a feeling we should have"". That is why Sonny and others have been campaigning for a ""Yes"" vote in a national referendum on Sunday and Monday that proposes halving the time required to apply for Italian citizenship. Any children under 18 would automatically be naturalised along with their parents. Cutting the wait from 10 years to five would bring this country in line with most others in Europe and, proponents argue, improve integration. The referendum was initiated by a citizens' initiative and is supported by civil society groups. But for such a referendum to be valid, 50% of all voters in Italy have to turn up. Giorgia Meloni, the country's hard-right prime minister, has announced she will boycott the vote, declaring the citizenship law already ""excellent"" and ""very open"". Other parties allied to her are calling on Italians to go to the beach instead of the polling station. Sonny will not be taking part either. Without citizenship, he is not entitled to vote. The question of who gets to be Italian is a sensitive one. Large numbers of migrants and refugees arrive in the country each year helped across the Mediterranean from North Africa by smuggling gangs. Meloni's populist government has made a big deal about cutting the number of arrivals. But this referendum is aimed at those who have travelled legally for work to a country with a rapidly shrinking and ageing population. The aim is limited: to speed up the process for getting citizenship, not ease the strict criteria. ""Knowledge of the Italian language, not having criminal charges, continuous residence et cetera - all the various requirements remain the same,"" explains Carla Taibi of the liberal party More Europe, one of several backers of the referendum. The reform would affect long-term foreign residents already employed in Italy and their families: from those on factory production lines in the north to those caring for pensioners in plush Rome neighbourhoods. Up to 1.4 million people could qualify for citizenship immediately, with some estimates ranging higher. ""These people live in Italy, study and work and contribute. This is about changing the perception of them so they are not strangers anymore - but Italian,"" argues Taibi. The reform would also have practical implications. As a non-Italian, Sonny cannot apply for a public sector job, and even struggled to get a driving licence. When he was booked for hit reality TV show Fame Island last year, he ended up arriving two weeks late on set in Honduras because he had had so many problems getting the right paperwork. For a long time, Meloni ignored the referendum entirely. Italy's publicly owned media, run by a close Meloni ally, have also paid scant attention to the vote. There is no substantive ""No"" campaign, making it hard to have a balanced debate. But the real reason appears strategic. ""They don't want to raise awareness of the significance of the referendum,"" Professor Roberto D'Alimonte of Luiss University in Rome explains. ""That's rational, to make sure that the 50% threshold won't be reached."" The prime minister eventually announced she would turn up at a polling station ""to show respect for the ballot box"" - but refuse to cast a vote. ""When you disagree, you also have the option of abstaining,"" Meloni told a TV chat show this week, after critics accused her of disrespecting democracy. Italy's citizenship system was ""excellent"", she argued, already granting citizenship to more foreign nationals than most countries in Europe: 217,000 last year, according to the national statistics agency, Istat. But about 30,000 of those were Argentines with Italian ancestry on the other side of the world, unlikely even to visit. Meanwhile, Meloni's coalition partner, Roberto Vannacci of the far-right League, accused those behind the referendum of ""selling off our citizenship and erasing our identity"". I ask Sonny why he thinks his own application for citizenship has taken over two decades. ""It's racism,"" he replies immediately. At one point his file was lost completely, and he has now been told his case is ""pending"". ""We have ministers who talk about white supremacy - racial replacement of Italy,"" the activist recalls a 2023 comment by the agriculture minister from Meloni's own party.  ""They don't want black immigration and we know it. I was born here 39 years ago so I know what I say."" It is an accusation the prime minister has denied repeatedly.  Insaf Dimassi, 28, defines herself as ""Italian without citizenship"". ""Italy let me grow up and become the person I am today, so not being seen as a citizen is extremely painful and frustrating,"" she explains from the northern city of Bologna where she is studying for a PhD. Insaf's father travelled to Italy for work when she was a baby, and she and her mother then joined him. Her parents finally got Italian citizenship 20 days after Insaf turned 18. That meant she had to apply for herself from scratch, including proving a steady income. Insaf chose to study instead. ""I arrived here at nine months old, and maybe at 33 or 34 - if all goes well - I can finally be an Italian citizen,"" she says, exasperated. She remembers exactly when the significance of her ""outsider"" status hit home: it was when she was asked to run for election alongside a candidate for mayor in her hometown. When she shared the news with her parents, full of excitement, they had to remind her she was not Italian and was not eligible. ""They say it's a matter of meritocracy to be a citizen, that you have to earn it. But more than being myself, what do I have to demonstrate?"" Insaf wants to know. ""Not being allowed to vote, or be represented, is being invisible."" On the eve of the referendum, students in Rome wrote a call to the polls on the cobbles of a city square. ""Vote 'YES' on the 8th and 9th [of June],"" they spelled out in giant cardboard letters. With a government boycott and such meagre publicity, the chances of hitting the 50% turnout threshold seem slim. But Sonny argues that this vote is just the beginning. ""Even if they vote 'No', we will stay here - and think about the next step,"" he says. ""We have to start to talk about the place of our community in this country.""

6/8/2025,Article,News,'My boyfriend is 5ft 6in but it doesn't matter' - Tinder's height filter divides daters,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/c98prk6ljdyo,"Joe is somewhat shorter than the average American man, at 5ft 6in (1.67m) - but when Ashley came across his Tinder profile last year, the last thing she was thinking about was Joe's height. ""We were talking about our hobbies and passions,"" Ashley says, ""not superficial things."" News that the dating app where Ashley and Joe found love is trialling a new feature - allowing some premium users to filter potential matches according to their height - was met with mixed reactions earlier this week. While daters like Ashley worry it might stifle possible connections, others say the feature might actually help shorter men find a match. Tinder's trial is running in ""limited"" parts of the world, excluding the UK, with the feature only available to those who pay for its two highest subscription tiers. Tinder has not told the BBC which countries it is being trialled in. It works by informing the app's matching algorithm based on a user's stated preference, rather than filtering out certain users altogether. But online reaction to its launch has ranged from amusement to outrage. ""Tinder just declared war on short kings,"" wrote one social media user, while another said they'd be ""using the Tinder height filter to filter out all men taller than 5ft 9in"". Another commented: ""I don't care what Tinder says - short kings are elite."" Ashley, from Wisconsin, says she understands why height can be a deal-breaker for some daters - but that wasn't the case for her. ""I've heard people talk: 'I can't wear heels or my partner will look shorter,'"" the 24-year-old says, ""but that's never mattered to me"". Joe is ""just such an amazing person"", she says, it wouldn't matter to her ""if he was six feet tall or five feet tall"". Using a height filter might actually have prevented her and Joe from ever meeting, she adds - and she reckons others could be missing out too. Joe, meanwhile, says Tinder's height filtering feature could actually make dating harder for shorter men. ""Limiting yourself to physical things about someone will lessen your opportunities and chances of finding a partner,"" he says. ""Height shouldn't matter when you're looking for forever."" The 27-year-old says his own dating experience hadn't ""all been so bad"" and that his matches had judged him based on his personality, rather than his height. But he thinks the new Tinder filter might affect other users' chances of meaningful connections. Tinder is not breaking new ground here - seasoned swipers will be familiar with various kinds of filter, which are now common features of dating apps including in the UK. Hinge, a key Tinder competitor, already allows paying users to filter matches according to their height. Other filters include education level, religion, and checking whether potential matches smoke, drink or take drugs. Bumble allows premium users to avoid matches with certain star signs, while paying Grindr users can filter by body type. But as the world's largest dating app, Tinder's experiment with height filtering still has huge significance, and has sparked discussion in Britain too. At 5ft 9in, Matt Heal, from Manchester, says he feels jaded about the online dating scene.  Matt's around average height for a man in the UK, but says some daters' preferences for taller men have disadvantaged him on the apps.  ""As someone who is neither very tall nor financially well off, I have definitely felt desensitised about dating [using apps],"" he says. The 28-year-old thinks it's understandable that apps like Tinder try to optimise their matching algorithms, though. ""People have preferences based on all sorts of things,"" Matt says, adding these features help people ""see others they are interested in, rather than swiping for hours on people you don't consider compatible"". However, he thinks daters shouldn't be too rigid about what they're looking for. ""If you were into people who are over six feet, would you really not date someone who's 5ft 11in"" - if they were good looking and had similar interests?"" Matt feels it's easier for men his height to meet people offline, explaining that meeting someone in person, through mutual friends, for example, can mean a less prescriptive approach. But Beth McColl, 31, thinks the Tinder height filter may offer shorter men some reassurance. The London-based writer and podcaster says it could help people avoid ""women who only want to date really tall men"".  Whether or not women will actually use this feature, Beth is uncertain. ""Women typically don't have a problem with dating a shorter man,"" Beth says, ""but they do, maybe, have a problem with dating a shorter man who is really hung up on it."" Aside from the filters, Beth believes the real problem of modern dating lies with the dating apps themselves. ""It encourages us to treat dating like picking something from the menu,"" she says, adding, ""there's nothing in being a little bit taller that will make that man a better partner - but I think we've tricked ourselves into thinking that there's truth in that."" As to whether the Tinder move will prove popular with users on a mass scale - that remains to be seen. ""Features like this capitalise on a well-known preference - some women desire taller partners,"" says Lara Besbrode, managing director at MatchMaker UK. ""They don't address the deeper issues at the heart of online dating fatigue."" But, she says, attraction is ""not static"" and can evolve over time. ""A man who is 5ft 7in (1.7m), but confident, kind, and emotionally attuned can be far more attractive than someone who ticks the 6ft (1.8m) box but lacks substance,"" Lara says. Tinder told the BBC its new filter demonstrates it is ""building with urgency, clarity, and focus"" and that it is ""part of a broader effort to help people connect more intentionally"" on the app. A spokesperson said: ""Not every test becomes a permanent feature, but every test helps us learn how we can deliver smarter, more relevant experiences and push the category forward."" And that fleeting moment when stumbling across each other's profiles on a dating app can be vital, as Ashley and Joe know. Ashley worries that people who use Tinder's new filter ""might be cutting themselves off from people who're a potential match for them, rather than someone who's their preferred height"". But for now her swiping days are over, and her relationship with Joe is blossoming. He's ""phenomenal"", Ashley says, ""super sweet"". Copyright 2025 BBC.

6/8/2025,Article,News,Israel warns it will stop aid yacht heading for Gaza,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/c0r1dvlkrxgo,"Israel has warned its military will ""take whatever measures are necessary"" to prevent a boat carrying pro-Palestinian activists and humanitarian aid reaching Gaza.  The Madleen yacht is 160 nautical miles from the Gaza Strip and is attempting to challenge Israel's sea blockade around the territory.  Defence Minister Israel Katz said the 12-strong crew, which includes climate protester Greta Thunberg, should turn back and that Israel will act against any attempt to breach the blockade. The Freedom Flotilla Coalition (FFC) said the vessel, which departed Sicily on Friday, was carrying humanitarian aid and was ""prepared for the possibility of an Israeli attack"".  Katz said the purpose of Israel's blockade, which has been in place since 2007, was to ""prevent the transfer of weapons to Hamas"" and was essential to Israel's security as it seeks to destroy the Palestinian armed group Hamas.  He warned in a post on X on Sunday: ""I have instructed the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] to act to prevent the 'Madeleine' [sic] hate flotilla from reaching the shores of Gaza - and to take whatever measures are necessary to that end."" Addressing the crew directly, he added: ""To the antisemitic Greta and her fellow Hamas propaganda spokespeople, I say clearly: You should turn back - because you will not reach Gaza. ""Israel will act against any attempt to break the blockade or assist terrorist organisations – at sea, in the air, and on land."" The FFC argues the sea blockade is illegal, and characterised the minister's statement as an example of Israel threatening the unlawful use of force against civilians and ""attempting to justify that violence with smears"".  ""We will not be intimidated. The world is watching,"" FFC press officer Hay Sha Wiya said.  ""The Madleen is a civilian vessel, unarmed and sailing in international waters, carrying humanitarian aid and human rights defenders from across the globe... Israel has no right to obstruct our effort to reach Gaza."" The group added that the vessel had earlier experienced temporary signal jamming, causing its location to appear near Jordan. The Madleen is carrying a symbolic quantity of aid, including rice and baby formula, the group said.  People from Brazil, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and Turkey are onboard. Israeli media say its navy is expected to block the boat before it reaches Gaza.  ""We will calmly take control of the ship, bring them to Israel, and deport them abroad that same night,"" an Israeli official told the Jerusalem Post.  In 2010, Israeli commandos killed 10 people when they boarded Turkish ship Mavi Marmara that was leading an aid flotilla towards Gaza.  Israel recently began to allow limited aid into Gaza after a three-month land blockade, prioritising distribution through the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), which is backed by Israel and the US but widely condemned by humanitarian groups. The UN's human rights chief Volker Türk said last week Palestinians were being presented with the ""grimmest of choices: die from starvation or risk being killed while trying to access the meagre food that is being made available"". It is almost 20 months since Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza in response to an unprecedented Hamas-led cross-border attack on Israel, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.

6/8/2025,Article,Sport,Sinner and Alcaraz thriller proves rivalry here to stay,https://www.bbc.com//sport/tennis/articles/ckgr4y2nz94o,"Sunday's title decider was the first French Open men's final between two players aged 23 or under in more than three decades A first major final between Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner, the two best players in the world, always promised to deliver. But even the most optimistic could not have anticipated it would reach the heights it did during a breathtaking five hours and 29 minutes. The two generational talents played out an instant classic at Roland Garros, in which Spain's Alcaraz recovered from two sets down - and saved three championship points - to retain his French Open title after a fifth set match tie-break. Alcaraz is only the third man to win a major final after saving a championship point since the Open era began in 1968. It was a fifth major triumph for Alcaraz, 22, who has now shared the sport's past six major titles with Italy's world number one Sinner, 23. Sunday's blockbuster, which broke the record for the longest French Open final in history, was the first Grand Slam men's final to feature two players born in the 2000s. If any doubt remained, this was confirmation of the dawn of a new era in men's tennis. The 2025 French Open final surpassed the four-hour and 47-minute 1982 showpiece as the longest in the tournament's history For more than two decades the men's game was dominated by Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer. But Djokovic, the only remaining active member of the trio, admitted he could have played his last French Open after his latest bid for a standalone record 25th Grand Slam title was ended by Sinner in the semi-finals. As the excitement surrounding Alcaraz and Sinner's rivalry entered the stratosphere in Paris on Sunday, the question of who could rise up and fill the void at the end of the 'Big Three' era has been answered. Seven-time major winner Mats Wilander, who won the previous longest Roland Garros final in 1982, said on TNT Sports: ""Federer and Nadal played a couple of good finals, but nothing comes close to this. ""I thought 'this is not possible - they're playing at a pace that is not human.' ""These are two of the best athletes the human race can put forward and they happen to be tennis players. I'm not speechless often, but what a wonderful day."" This was the first meeting in a major final between two familiar foes who have become the standout performers on the ATP Tour. Italy's Sinner, who served a three-month doping suspension between February and May, has shown remarkable consistency over the past 20 months, losing just 10 of 121 matches since the Beijing Open in September 2023. But half of those defeats have come in his past five meetings with Alcaraz. In fact, Sinner has lost just three of his past 50 matches - all to the Spaniard. ""I think every rivalry is different,"" said Sinner. ""Back in the days, they played different tennis. Now it's very physical, but you cannot compare.  ""I was lucky enough to play against Novak and Rafa. Beating these guys, it takes a lot. ""I have the same feeling with Carlos and some other players. It's very special. I'm happy to be part of this."" Alcaraz, who will begin his Wimbledon title defence in just three weeks, now leads the head-to-head with Sinner 8-4. In becoming the first man to win his first five Grand Slam singles finals in the Open era, Alcaraz ended Sinner's perfect record in major finals and his pursuit of a third-straight slam. ""Every match I'm playing against him is important,"" Alcaraz said. ""This is the first match in a Grand Slam final. Hopefully not the last because every time we face each other, we raise our level to the top.  ""If you want to win Grand Slams, you have to beat the best tennis players in the world."" With seven of the past eight slams going to Alcaraz and Sinner - a streak of dominance punctuated only by Novak Djokovic's 24th major title at the 2023 US Open - it remains to be seen if any other players can challenge the newly established status quo. French newspaper L'Equipe's front page on Monday read: 'Five hours 29 minutes of legend' Alcaraz emulated his childhood hero Rafael Nadal - a record 14-time champion at Roland Garros - by winning his fifth major at the exact same age of 22 years, one month and three days. Sinner, meanwhile, is the youngest man to reach three consecutive Grand Slam singles finals since 14-time major winner Pete Sampras in 1994. Such statistics offer a strong indication of the trajectory they both find themselves on. So, where does their rivalry go from here?  The pair both have titles to defend at the two remaining slams in 2025 - Alcaraz at Wimbledon and Sinner at the US Open. Alcaraz, who leads Sinner 20-19 in career titles, has reduced Sinner's lead at the top of the world rankings to 2,030 points. But the reigning champion has 2,000 points to defend at Wimbledon, compared to just 400 for Sinner after his quarter-final exit last year. ""I'm sure he will learn from this match and come back stronger next time we face each other,"" Alcaraz added. ""I'm sure he's going to do his homework. I'm going to try to learn how I can be better [and] tactically hurt his game.  ""I'm not going to beat him forever, that's obvious. So I have to keep learning from the matches I play against him.""

6/8/2025,Article,News,Trump-Musk row heightens fears over Nasa budget cuts,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/c87jq0djw00o,"The row between US President Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk over a major spending bill has exacerbated uncertainty over the future of Nasa's budget, which was already facing deep cuts. The White House had requested huge cuts to the space agency's budget, which would see funding for science projects cut by nearly a half. Now the president has threatened to withdraw federal contracts with Musk's company, Space X, further jeopardising the US space programme. Nasa relies on the firm's Falcon 9 rocket fleet to resupply the International Space Station with crew and supplies. The space agency also expects to use its Starship rocket to send astronauts to the Moon and eventually to Mars once it has been developed. Dr Simeon Barber, a space scientist at the Open University, said that the uncertainty was having a ""chilling impact"" on the human space programme. ""The astonishing exchanges, snap decisions and U-turns we've witnessed in the last week undermine the very foundations that we build our ambitions on. ""Space science and exploration relies upon long term planning and cooperation between government, companies and academic institutions."" Even before the feud between Trump and Musk, there was concern about the proposed cuts. Forty science missions, which are in development or in space already, are in line to be stood down. All sectors have been earmarked for savings, apart from an effort to send astronauts to Mars, which has received a $100m (£74m) boost. According to Casey Dreier, chief of space policy for the Pasadena-based Planetary Society, which promotes space exploration, the potential cuts represent ""the biggest crisis ever to face the US space programme"". Nasa has published details of how it plans to make the cuts requested by the White House in its budget request to Congress, proposing a reduction by nearly a quarter. The agency says the plan ""aligns [its] science and technology portfolios to missions essential for the exploration of the Moon and Mars"". Dr Adam Baker, a space analyst at Cranfield University, told BBC News that if these proposals are approved by Congress, it would fundamentally shift the agency's focus. ""President Trump is repurposing Nasa for two things: to land astronauts on the Moon before the Chinese and to have astronauts plant a US flag on Mars. Everything else is secondary."" Those who back the proposals say the White House's budget has given Nasa a clear purpose, for the first time since the days of the Apollo Moon landings of the 1960s and 70s, when the aim was to beat the Soviet Union to the Moon.  Nasa's critics say that, since then, the space agency has become a bloated, unfocussed bureaucracy which routinely goes massively over budget in its space missions and wastes taxpayer's money.  One of the most egregious examples of this is Nasa's new rocket for its plans to return American astronauts to the Moon, the Space Launch System (SLS). Its development has been delayed, and costs have spiralled such that it costs $4.1bn (£3.3bn) for each and every launch.  By contrast, SpaceX's equivalent rocket system, Starship, is estimated to cost around $100m (£80m) per launch because it is designed to be reusable. Jeff Bezos's Blue Origin space company promises similar savings for its proposed New Glenn rocket. To no one's surprise, SLS will be phased out under the White House proposals, in the hope that Starship and New Glenn can take its place. But the past three development launches of Starship have been unsuccessful, and Blue Origin has only recently begun to test its Moon rocket. ""The worry is that Nasa may be jumping out of the frying pan, into the fire,"" says Dr Barber. ""The development of these alternatives to SLS is being bankrolled by Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos.  ""If they lose their appetite for this endeavor and SpaceX or Blue Origin say they need more money to develop their systems, Congress will have to give it to them."" Of greater concern, says Dr Barber, is the potential loss of 40 missions to explore other planets and to monitor the impact of climate change on Earth from space, many of which involve collaborations with international partners. ""I think it is very sad that what has taken so long to build can be knocked down with a wrecking ball so quickly with no plan to rebuild it afterwards."" The projects facing the axe include dozens of planetary missions already in space for which most of the development and launch costs have already been paid for, with relatively small savings proposed on their operating costs. Also under threat are two collaborations with the European Space Agency: an ambitious plan to bring martian rocks collected by Nasa's Perseverance rover back to Earth and a mission to send Europe's Rosalind Franklin rover to the red planet to search for signs of past life. Prof Sir Martin Sweeting, head of the UK space firm Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd and co-author of a Royal Society report on the future of space, says that while the development was ""unwelcome"", there may be an upside for Europe as it takes greater responsibility for its own space exploration programme. ""Maybe we have been too reliant on Nasa [as] the big player to carry a lot of the emphasis in space,"" he told BBC News. ""It is an opportunity to think about how Europe wants to get a better balance in its space activities."" But there is much more downside for Europe in the short term. As well as the return of Mars samples and its rover, the ESA risks reduced access to the International Space Station if it is wound down, and the budget cuts cancel Nasa's extensive contributions to its successor, the Lunar Gateway, a multinational space station planned for orbit around the Moon. In its recently published strategy the ESA stated it ""will be seeking to build a more autonomous space capability, and to continue being a reliable, strong and desirable partner with space agencies from around the globe"", with the implication that it would do so with or without Nasa. Also facing cuts are numerous current and proposed Earth Observation programmes, according to Dr Baker. ""These Earth Observation programmes are our canary in the coal mine,"" he told BBC News. ""Our ability to predict the impact of climate change and mitigate against it could be drastically reduced. If we turn off this early warning system it is a frightening prospect."" The budget proposals have yet to be approved by Congress. The Planetary Society's Casey Dreier has told BBC News that many Republicans have told lobbyists privately that they are prepared to vote against the cuts. But, Mr Dreier worries that there is a strong possibility that political gridlock might mean that no budget is agreed.  It is likely that the reduced White House budget would be put in place as an interim measure, which then could not easily be reversed, because once space missions are turned off it is hard, if not impossible, to start them up again.

6/8/2025,Article,News,"It's the Race Across The World finale, and Love Island is back: What's coming up this week",https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/c93yx110neyo,"This week, it's the Race Across the World finale on BBC One, with the competitors battling to reach the finish line first. But that's not all the next seven days have in store. A fresh batch of singletons will be heading into the Love Island villa, it's the finale of I Kissed A Boy, Louis Theroux will be speaking to Ed Sheeran on his podcast, gaming fans have MindsEye to look forward to, and Rebel Wilson and Jason Isaacs are starring in new pop musical Juliet & Romeo. Read on for what's coming up this week... Another frenetic Race Across the World comes to an end on Wednesday. For anyone who hasn't seen the Bafta-winning BBC One show, it features a number of duos racing around the globe for a £20,000 prize. This year's pairs have been tasked with travelling around 14,000km - starting at the Great Wall of China and taking in the sights across Nepal and India. The scenery has been breath-taking, but for me, this show is as much about its contestants as the race and travelling. Everyone taking part has a story to tell, and they are always incredibly relatable - from bickering teenage sweethearts Fin and Sioned, to mother and son Caroline and Tom. This year's lineup also included sisters Elizabeth and Letitia, former married couple Yin and Gaz, and brothers Brian and Melvyn. Love Island is back, and if you're a fan of the show, you'll be getting set for another summer of fun, flirtation and plenty of drama. The latest season of the reality dating show starts on ITV2 and ITVX on Monday, a decade after it first hit our screens. This year's line-up includes a motivational speaker, a gold trader and a landscape gardener. However, one Love Islander's journey has ended before the new series has even started. Kyle Ashman, 23, was due to enter the villa but was axed after The Sun newspaper revealed he had been arrested over a fight at a funeral earlier this year. In an Instagram post Kyle, who was released by police without further action, said he was ""innocent"". After that rocky start, ITV's bosses will be hoping for smoother sailing over the coming weeks - and also to continue the viewing boost that last year's series enjoyed. Tonight, it's the series 2 finale of the UK's first ever gay dating show, I Kissed a Boy, on BBC Three. As the name might suggest, the format sees 10 singles matched up, and introduced for the first time - with a kiss to test out their chemistry. Over the past month, we've seen budding romance, wandering eyes and lots of drama in the Masseria - all overseen by Dannii Minogue in her role as Cupid. One of the remaining contestants, Jack S, says there is more drama in this last episode ""than there has been all series"", while another, Ruben, says you should ""expect the unexpected"". If you miss the grand finale, you can catch up on the whole series on BBC iPlayer. By Guy Lambert, culture reporter Ed Sheeran blew fans away when he made a surprise appearance at Radio 1's Big Weekend in Liverpool last month. Just days later he that was caught off guard, when he took a tumble on stage in front of 70,000 people, kicking off his European tour in Madrid. Ed's 2025 Mathematics Tour will see him play his biggest tunes in venues across 13 European countries, as well as tracks from his upcoming album Play, which is released in September. On Tuesday, he's making a safer appearance on Louis Theroux's podcast, which will be available on Spotify. I am told that the conversation will be a journey through his career, from the challenges he faced breaking into the industry, to performing on the biggest stages like Glastonbury in 2017. By Tom Richardson, Newsbeat reporter If you know games, you know the name. Leslie Benzies is hailed as one of the key minds behind the success of the record-breaking Grand Theft Auto series. After quitting developer Rockstar Games in 2016, he launched his own studio, Build A Rocket Boy (BARB). So you might expect a buzz around MindsEye, BARB's debut effort, releasing on PS5, Xbox and PC from Tuesday. On first glance the single-player game has big GTA vibes with car chases, shootouts and cinematic cut-scenes, but its makers say it's also the start of an ambitious ""multi-narrative universe"". However, the run-up to its release has been dampened by some less-than-enthusiastic previews calling out issues and airing concerns over its quality. BARB vowed to fix these before launch day, but it remains to be seen if this is a narrative it can turn in its favour. By Danny Fullbrook, culture reporter If you've ever wished Romeo & Juliet swapped Shakespearean verse for pop anthems, then Rebel Wilson's latest film might be your perfect match Juliet & Romeo is the first part in a planned pop musical trilogy, hitting cinemas for one night only on 11 June. Filmed on location in fair Verona the film stars Clara Rugaard (Black Mirror) and Jamie Ward (His Dark Materials) as the star-crossed lovers. The supporting players includes Jason Isaacs, Rupert Everett and Sir Derek Jacobi. Wilson said she was interested in playing Juliet's mother, Lady Capulet, as it was a chance to play against type. Critics have seen it a little differently. A one star review from The Washington Post called it as ""a very special kind of hell"". However Maggie Lovitt at Collider was a bit kinder when she said: ""Juliet & Romeo isn't necessarily a good film, but it is a very fun film."" Copyright 2025 BBC.

6/8/2025,Article,News,Doctors trialling 'poo pills' to flush out dangerous superbugs,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/clyge290l4xo,"UK doctors are attempting to clear dangerous superbug infections using ""poo pills"" containing freeze-dried faeces. The stool samples come from healthy donors and are packed with good bacteria. Early data suggests superbugs can be flushed out of the dark murky depths of the bowel and replaced with a mix of healthy gut bacteria. It is a new approach to tackling infections that resist antibiotics, which are thought to kill a million people each year. The focus is on the bowels which are ""the biggest reservoir of antibiotic resistance in humans"" says Dr Blair Merrick, who has been testing the pills at Guys and St Thomas' hospitals. Drug-resistant superbugs can escape their intestinal home and cause trouble elsewhere in the body – such as urinary tract or bloodstream infections. ""So there's a lot of interest in 'can you get rid of them from the gut?',"" says Dr Merrick. The idea of poo-pills isn't as far-fetched as it might seem. Faecal transplants – also known  as a trans-poo-tion - are already approved for treating severe diarrhoea caused by Clostridium difficile bacteria. But scientists noticed hints that faecal transplants for C. difficile also seemed to get rid of superbugs. New research has focused on patients who had an infection caused by drug-resistant bacteria in the past six months. They were given pills made from faeces which people had donated to a stool bank. Each stool sample is tested to ensure it does not contain any harmful bugs, undigested food is removed and then it is freeze dried into a powder. This is stored inside a pill that can pass through the stomach unscathed and reach the intestines where it dissolves to release its poopy powdery payload. The trial has taken place on 41 patients at Guy's and St Thomas' hospitals in London to lay the groundwork for a large-scale study.  It showed patients were up for taking a poo pill and the donated bacteria were still being detected in the bowels at least a month later. Dr Merrick says there are ""really promising signals"" that poo pills could help tackle the rising scourge of superbugs and that donor bacteria could be going to microbial war with the superbugs as they compete over food and space on the lining of the gut and either rid the body of them completely or ""reduce them down to a level that doesn't cause problems"". The study also suggests the array of gut bacteria becomes more varied after the therapy. This is a sign of good health and ""may well be promoting colonisation resistance"" so it is harder for new infectious bugs to get in. ""It's very exciting. There's a real shift from 20 years ago where all bacteria and viruses were assumed to do you harm; to now where we realise they are completely necessary to our overall health,"" says Dr Merrick. Earlier this week scientists showed the good bacteria our bodies meet – in the hours after we are born – seem to halve the risk of young children being admitted to hospital with lung infections.  Our body's own human cells are outnumbered by the bacteria, fungi and others that live inside us - known as the microbiome. This has led to research implicating the microbiome in everything from Crohn's disease to cancer to mental health.  If poo pills are proven to work against superbugs in larger studies then the researchers think they could be used for both treatment and prevention in people at risk.  Medical procedures that suppress the immune system - including cancer therapies and organ transplants - can make the body more vulnerable. ""A lot of these individuals come to a lot of harm from drug resistant organisms,"" Dr Merrick. The UK's drugs regulator – the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) – said there were more than 450 microbiome medicines currently in development. ""Some of them will succeed, so I do think we will see them coming through quite soon,"" said Dr Chrysi Sergaki, the head of microbiome research at the MHRA. ""We could potentially, in the future, replace antibiotics with microbiome [therapies] - that's the big picture, so there's a lot of potential."" Copyright 2025 BBC.

6/8/2025,Article,Culture,Five works that reveal Banksy's hidden philosophy,https://www.bbc.com//culture/article/20250602-five-works-that-reveal-the-philosophy-of-banksy,"Banksy's new mural in Marseille is not the first image he has connected to the history of ideas. From Plato to Foucault, a Banksy expert reveals the philosophy behind these popular artworks. Which is the real you, the person you are now or the one you are capable of becoming? It's a heady question, to be sure, and not one you would expect to be confronted with while strolling down a street in Marseille in the waning days of May. Yet it's precisely the existential dilemma that Banksy, who once asserted ""being yourself is overrated"" – has surreptitiously installed in a cloistered stretch of the quiet Rue Félix Fregier, the site of a new work – the latest installment in the elusive artist's decades-long career as a provocative philosophical prankster.  For more than 30 years, Banksy has spiked many of his most iconic works – from his girl reaching hopelessly for a heart-shaped balloon to his masked rioter hurling a bouquet of flowers – with barbed allusions to Old Masters, from Michelangelo to Monet, Vermeer to Van Gogh. But there's more. Beneath his stealthy stencils lies a deep and deliberate engagement with the history of ideas as well, from classical Stoicism to postmodern deconstructionism. On 29 May, Banksy posted on Instagram a photo of his first new piece in more than five months, piquing the internet's interest by withholding its precise location. Discovered shortly thereafter in the major port city in southern France, Marseille, the mural is, at first glance, deceptively simple: a tall silhouette of a lighthouse spray-painted on to a blank beige urban wall; a rusting street bollard positioned nearby; and a painted shadow stretching across the pavement, joining the real-world object to its augmented, if two-dimensional, echo. Stencilled across the black lighthouse are the words: ""I want to be what you saw in me.""  Anyone keen to find a source for the ideas that inform Banksy's new work needs merely to flip open any history of philosophy to Plato's seminal allegory of the cave (from the Fourth-Century BC treatise The Republic), then flip the ancient metaphor on its head. In Plato's parable, prisoners chained inside a cave mistake shadows on the wall for reality, unaware of the truer forms that cast them outside. But here, Banksy, being Banksy, baits us by switching the set-up, reversing the relationship between essence and shadow. In Banksy's mural, the drab bollard casts not a diminished imitation of itself, but something far grander – a lighthouse, a symbol of illumination and guidance. Here, it's the silhouette, not reality, that's true. Banksy's inversion urges us to ask where reality really resides: in what is, or in what might be? His poignant phrase – ""I want to be what you saw in me"" – is alluringly elastic. Is this the bollard dreaming of being more than it appears? Or the shadow wishing to become light? Or is it all of us – Banksy included – struggling to live up to the better versions imagined by those who believe in us? The answer is surely yes to all of the above. And it's a yes too to the question: 'is this new work a lamp capable of shining light on further levels of meaning in Banksy?' What follows is a brief look back at some of the artist's best-known works and how they too are invigorated by, and often upend, many of the most important philosophical tenets – both social and intellectual – that underwrite who we are and who we might be. Banksy's new mural in Marseille is not the first to be accompanied by an affecting caption connecting the piece to the history of ideas. Among his most famous murals, Girl with Balloon, which portrays a child reaching towards a heart-shaped balloon drifting away from her, first appeared in 2002 in various locations in London, including on the South Bank, alongside the consoling assertion, ""there is always hope"". That conviction, which fuels the ceaseless striving for an ideal that is seemingly unobtainable in the mural (there's no way that balloon is coming back) rhymes richly with aspects of 19th-Century German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer's ideas concerning an unquenchable and irrational ""Will"" as a fundamental force that drives humanity. When, years later, Banksy mischievously concealed a remote-controlled shredder in the frame of a version of Girl with Balloon that came up for auction in 2018, and sensationally destroyed the work before the eyes of aghast auction-goers, he succeeded in upping the ante on Schopenhauer's belief in the futility of desire by boldly manifesting it himself. Where there's a will there's a fray. Banksy's famous mural of a masked man frozen forever in the instant before he unleashes not a brick or a bomb but a bouquet of flowers may seem, at first blush, to exemplify a pacifist's commitment to peaceful disobedience. The work appears to echo the precepts of Mahatma Gandhi's Satyagraha – a philosophy of non-violence that the Indian ethicist coined in 1919. Banksy's fully flexed figure, incongruously armed with a fistful of beauty, appears to epitomise Gandhi's insistence on wielding moral, not physical, strength. Doesn't it? Or has Banksy slyly subverted the philosophical assertion of pacifistic force by portraying his hero as an enraged rioter? The figure's anger has not been tempered by an appeal to the higher ideals of beauty and truth. Instead, those ideals have been weaponised by Banksy. Here, beauty and truth are not disarming, they are devastatingly explosive. Banksy's mural in Marseille employs a tried-and-true technique to ensure the work protrudes into the urban space in which we'll encounter it – elevating its philosophical potential from something flimsy and flat to something undeniably urgent. It's a tactic he used in a 2007 work that appeared near London's Oxford Street in which he depicts a boy atop a precariously high ladder, spray-painting the penetrating observation that we are ""One Nation Under CCTV"" in outlandishly outsized letters. Also portrayed within the mural is a uniformed officer and his obedient police dog who surveil the young vandal, while above them all an actual CCTV camera, presumably recording everything, juts out from the wall. The endless layers of surveillance-within-surveillance to which the work attests – as we watch the state watch an officer watch the boy – captures with uncanny precision the philosophical contours of the vast and all-encompassing prison machine in which the French poststructural philosopher Michel Foucault believed everyone in society was now irredeemably enmeshed. In Foucault's study Discipline and Punish: The Birth of the Prison, he resuscitates a blueprint for a prison proposed by the British utilitarian philosopher Jeremy Bentham at the end of the 18th Century, ""The Panopticon"" (meaning ""all seeing""), and uses it as a menacing metaphor for how no one can escape the perniciously penetrating eye of the panoptical state.  Banksy's witty 2014 work Mobile Lovers shines a chilling light on the state of contemporary relationships. The mural depicts a couple whose almost affectionate embrace is interrupted by the deeper fondness they have for the warm glow of their smartphones. The French existentialist philosopher Simone de Beauvoir, who died in 1986, may not have lived long enough to witness the emergence of mobiles. Yet her profoundly influential 1947 book The Ethics of Ambiguity – published exactly 60 years before the iPhone was launched in 2007 – with its exploration of the devastation that detachment and disconnection can wreak on the realisation of our truest selves, is profoundly proleptic of our modern predicament. To be free, de Beauvoir insisted, requires a deep attentiveness to each other. She believed in the authenticity of human encounters, without which life is a futile performance, dimly lit by disposable devices, rather than something profound and meaningful.  How Banksy Saved Art History by Kelly Grovier, published by Thames & Hudson, is out now. -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.

6/8/2025,Article,Travel,How WW2 changed the French diet,https://www.bbc.com//travel/article/20250605-how-world-war-two-changed-the-french-diet,"More than 80 years after D-Day, the recipes and ingredients introduced during France's wartime occupation are slowly making a comeback. By June 1940, German forces had blitzed through France in just six weeks, leading more than half of the country to be occupied. As a result, French staples like cheese, bread and meat were soon rationed, and by 1942 some citizens were living on as few as 1,110 calories per day. Even after World War Two ended in 1945, access to food in France would continue to be regulated by the government until 1949. Such austerity certainly had an impact on how the French ate during and just after the war. Yet, more than 80 years after Allied forces landed in Normandy to begin liberating the nation on D-Day (6 June 1944), few visitors realise that France's wartime occupation still echoes across the nation's culinary landscape. In the decades following WW2, the French abandoned the staples that had got them through the tough times of occupation; familiar ingredients like root vegetables and even hearty pain de campagne (country bread) were so eschewed they were nearly forgotten. But as wartime associations have slowly faded from memory, a bevy of younger chefs and tastemakers are reviving the foods that once kept the French alive. There aren't many French residents old enough to vividly recall life in wartime France today, and fewer still would deign to discuss it. Author Kitty Morse only discovered her great-grandparents' ""Occupation diary and recipe book"" after her own mother's death. Morse released them in 2022 in her book Bitter Sweet: A Wartime Journal and Heirloom Recipes from Occupied France. ""My mother never said any of this to me,"" she said. BBC.com's World's Table ""smashes the kitchen ceiling"" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future. Aline Pla was just nine years old in 1945 but, raised by small-town grocers in the south of France, she remembers more than others might. ""You were only allowed a few grams of bread a day,"" she recalled. ""Some [people] stopped smoking – especially those with kids. They preferred trading for food."" Such widespread lack gave rise to ersatz replacements: saccharine stood in for sugar; butter was supplanted by lard or margarine; and instead of coffee, people brewed roots or grains, like acorns, chickpeas or the barley Pla recalls villagers roasting at home. While many of these wartime brews faded from fashion, chicory coffee remained a staple, at least in northern France. Ricoré – a blend of chicory and instant coffee – has been on supermarket shelves since the 1950s. More recently, brands like Cherico are reimagining it for a new generation, marketing it as a climate-conscious, healthful alternative traditional coffee. According to Patrick Rambourg, French culinary historian and author of Histoire de la Cuisine et de la Gastronomie Françaises, if chicory never wholly disappeared in France, it's in large part thanks to its flavour. ""Chicory tastes good,"" he explained. ""It doesn't necessarily make you think of periods of austerity."" Other products did, however, such as swedes and Jerusalem artichokes, which WW2 historian Fabrice Grenard asserted ""were more reserved for animals before the war."" The French were nevertheless forced to rely heavily on them once potato rationing began in November 1940, and after the war, these vegetables became almost ""taboo"", according to Rambourg. ""My mother never cooked a swede in her life,"" added Morse. Two generations later, however, Jerusalem artichokes, in particular, have surged to near-omnipresence in Paris, from the trendy small plates at Belleville wine bar Paloma to the classic chalkboard menu at bistro Le Bon Georges. Alongside parsnips, turnips and swedes, they're often self-awarely called ""les legumes oubliés""(""the forgotten vegetables"") and, according to Léo Giorgis, chef-owner of L'Almanach Montmartre, French chefs have been remembering them for about 15 years.  ""Now you see Jerusalem artichokes everywhere, [as well as] swedes [and] golden turnips,"" he said. As a chef dedicated to seasonal produce, Giorgis finds their return inspiring, especially in winter. ""Without them, we're kind of stuck with cabbages and butternut squash."" According to Apollonia Poilâne, the third generation of her family to run the eponymous bakery Poilâne, founded in 1932, a similar shift took place with French bread. Before the war, she explained, white baguettes, which weren't subject to the same imposed prices as sourdough, surged to popularity on a marketplace rife with competition.  But in August 1940, bread was one of the first products to be rationed, and soon, white bread was supplanted by darker-crumbed iterations bulked out with bran, chestnut, potato or buckwheat. The sale of fresh bread was forbidden by law, which some say was implemented specifically to reduce bread's palatability. ""I never knew white bread!"" said Pla. When one went to eat at a friend's home during wartime, she recalled, ""You brought your bread – your bread ration. Your own piece of bread.""  Hunger for white bread surged post-war – so much so that while Poilâne's founder, Pierre Poilâne, persisted in producing the sourdoughs he so loved, his refusal to bake more modern loaves saw him ejected from bakery syndicates, according to his granddaughter, Apollonia. These days, however, the trend has come full circle: Baguette consumption fell 25% from 2015 to 2025, but the popularity of so-called ""special"" breads made with whole or heirloom grains is on the rise. ""It's not bad that we're getting back to breads that are a bit less white,"" said Pla. For Grenard, however, the most lasting impact the war left on French food culture was a no-waste mindset. ""What remains after the war is more of a state of mind than culinary practices,"" he said. Rambourg agreed: ""You know the value of food when you don't have any."" The French were forced to get creative with what they had. In France's south-eastern Ardèche department, Clément Faugier rebranded its sweetened chestnut paste as Génovitine, a name whose medical consonance made it easier to market as a fortifier and even prescribe. In the coastal Camargue region, local samphire suddenly stood in for green beans. Morse's great-grandfather foraged for wild mushrooms in the nearby Vosges mountains, and in cities, those with balconies planted their window boxes with carrots or leeks. Paris' public Jardin des Tuileries was even transformed into collective kitchen gardens. According to Rambourg, this subsistence mindset ""would affect the entire generation that lived through the war, and our parents, because they were the children of our grandparents, who knew the war."" More like this: • How French winemakers outwitted the Nazis • The top-secret meeting that helped win D-Day • The French cocktail born from a banned spirit As the need for these subsistence methods dissipated, French cuisine underwent another period of change. In 1963, the country welcomed its first Carrefour hypermarket, and large-scale supermarkets soon supplanted small shops. According to Grenard, this was partly due to ""suspicion"" following corruption during the German occupation, when some grocers inflated prices far past the norm, just because they could . ""At the end of the war, consumers held real rancour against small shopkeepers,"" said Grenard. ""In a supermarket, the prices are fixed.""  Fast-forward eight decades, and some locals, now motivated by climate change are turning back to small, local grocers, such as the locavore Terroir d’Avenir shops dotting Paris. Others are reaching into the nation's past to resuscitate techniques like canning, preserving and foraging that saved many French residents during the war, according to Grenard. ""The people that got by the best were the ones who had reserves."" Today, filling the larder with foraged food has become popular once again. In Kaysersberg, Alsace, chef Jérôme Jaegle of Alchémille puts this ancestral knowledge centre-stage by offering wild harvesting workshops culminating in a multi-course meal. And in Milly-la-Forêt, just outside Paris, François Thévenon highlights the foraging techniques he learned from his grandmother with classes teaching others how to seek out these edible plants themselves. ""After the war"", he explained, ""people wanted to reassure themselves that they wouldn't lack anything anymore."" They turned, he said, to overconsumption, specifically of meat, which even his foraging grandmother ate every day, at every meal. ""You often hear when you ask older folk why they no longer eat wild plants, that it's because they don't have to,"" Thévenon said, who forages for wild plants because he believes it's good for his health and that of the planet. According to Apollonia, the war didn't only change how France eats. ""It probably changed the way the world eats,"" she asserted. Today, the techniques and philosophies that helped the French survive are slowly coming back to life. -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.  For more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.   Copyright 2025 BBC.

6/8/2025,Article,Travel,Eight rare juices you can only try in the Amazon,https://www.bbc.com//travel/article/20250529-eight-rare-juices-you-can-only-try-in-the-amazon,"Far from smoothie bars and powdered sachets, these wild Amazonian juices are pulped just hours after picking – making them rich in flavour and cultural meaning. The Amazon is not only the world's largest and most biodiverse ecosystem – it's also one of the most delicious. Among the thousands of native species, around 220 trees are known to bear edible fruit, many of which never leave the jungle. Some are too delicate to export, while others are little known beyond the communities that have nurtured them for generations. But along the Amazon River and its tributaries – from Peru's misty highland jungle to the floodplains of northern Brazil – travellers can find market stalls and cafe counters brimming with thick, vibrant juices that capture the flavour of the forest. These are the fruits you're unlikely to find bottled or powdered at home, often pulped just hours after harvest, served chilled in the tropical heat and prized not only for their nutrients but for their rich textures and sharp tangs. Here are eight juices worth seeking out, whether for their bold flavours, cultural significance or the thrill of trying something new. On the eastern slopes of the Andes, where rivers cascade in dramatic waterfalls into the Amazon Basin, travellers will find the aguaje fruit of the Moriche palm. In the small Peruvian city of Tingo Maria, markets are piled high with silver trays of the armadillo-like fruit. Locals soak them in water for a day or two, before peeling the brown armour to reveal an intensely orange flesh. The pulp is soaked, mashed and transformed into aguajina – a thick and custardy drink that tastes like cross between pumpkin pie and flan. BBC.com's World's Table ""smashes the kitchen ceiling"" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future. Some locals say that the fruit contains oestrogen compounds and men should be careful of drinking too much of it, though there is little scientific evidence. ""The aguajina is very useful – for the bone, for the skin, for the complexion – especially for women,"" says Gianina Pujay, an aguajinera who sells the drink across from Tingo Maria's fruit market. In the same region, the cocona fruit, a tropical relative of the common tomato, yields a tangy juice that tastes like a pineapple-papaya hybrid with a thick, almost oily body.  ""Many Amazonian fruits are consumed in juice form because their pulp is acidic, fibrous or difficult to eat raw, like the cocona,"" explains Miluska Carrasco, a researcher and nutritionist at Peru's Instituto de Investigación Nutricional, ""It's also a practical way to use them quickly before they spoil."" Descending from the verdant slopes of the Andes into the Amazon Basin, the rivers slow down and transform into thoroughfares of commercial activity. On the banks of the Ucayali River is the river port city of Pucallpa, the furthest Peru's road system will take you into the centre of the Amazon. Here, where container barges, passenger ships and canoes all move goods around the forest, camu camu is a must-drink juice.  The small, tart, plum-like fruit tastes like a sour strawberry with a hint of peach, and is a favourite of local juice vendors. ""[It] has more vitamin C than oranges,"" says Carrasco, ""[as well as] other bioactive compounds."" Where a navel orange provides about 6mg of vitamin C per 100g, the camu camu contains more than 2,000mg for the same amount of flesh.  The season for camu camu is short, however, typically between January and March, so take advantage of the fresh juice when it's available. Locals also eat the little plums with salt; just spit out the seeds.  In the heart of Brazil's vast Amazonas state, 700 miles east of Pucallpa as the toucan flies (and at least a week or more on a river boat), tucumã palms provide an orange fruit that's only in season from February to August. During this time, it's often eaten for breakfast with cassava flour and is a key ingredient in the state's signature x-caboquinho sandwich, where slices are layered with salty coalho cheese and sweet chunks of fried plantains. To make juice from the notoriously fibrous tucumã, vendors use peelers, blenders and sieves to reduce shavings of the fruit to a pulp and then filter out the lightly nutty liquid. According to Francisco Falcão, a farmer in the community of Bom Jesus in the Tefé National Forest, ""people say that tucumã is good to eat and improves sight and skin"". Indeed, the fruit is rich in both manganese and calcium. Where kiwi, which is relatively high in calcium, contains around 30mg of calcium per 100g, tucumã has been measured to contain around four times as much. Also in the Tefé region, ""there's a palm tree that people eat the fruit of,"" says Falcão. ""Pupunha is a plant that we harvest starting in December and ending February."" Spanish-speaking parts of the Amazon know this oily palm fruit as pejibaye or pijuayo, and it is a key source of natural fats as well as vitamin B1 and vitamin E.   The pupunha grow in clusters of orange and red acorn-shaped fruit. They cannot be eaten raw, but once boiled they make a filling snack akin to an oily sweet potato. The boiled fruits also produce a creamy orange juice once fully pulped. In Peru, forest communities ferment the pulp into a lightly alcoholic drink called chicha or masato – especially during times of harvest.    In Manaus, capital of the Amazonas, reliable refrigeration means locals and visitors can enjoy fruits in various forms. The thick shell of the cupuaçu contains a collection of seeds surrounded by a fleshy white pulp. That pulp can be transformed into silky, tangy juice. But lately, locals have been incorporating its juice into ice cream. Indeed, the rest of Brazil is catching on, with ice cream parlours in Rio de Janeiro now offering the flavour too. More like this: • Spain's 'white gold' super-drink • A decadent avocado smoothie to break the Ramadan fast • The Caribbean's cooling, healthy elixir for summer Cupuaçu tastes like a creamy pineapple – surprising given that it's a close relative of cacao. ""It's the same genus as cacao and people make cupulate [as opposed to chocolate from it],"" says Daniel Tregidgo, a researcher at Brazil's Mamirauá Institute for Sustainable Development. ""When you go to the markets there are huge piles of cupuaçu seeds. I look at that and I say that's hipster chocolate right there."" Why haven’t we heard of cupulate yet? In Tregidgo's opinion, ""It's a matter of investment. If you take something from the middle of Amazon and you try to get it out into the global market without being exploitative, it is a bit tricky."" Bars produced from cupuaçu have the flavour of chocolate but retain some of their citrus piquancy. In the Amazon delta, jenipapo is known for its traditional use as a blue dye and a temporary tattoo ink. The fruit itself, which grows all along Brazil's coast in addition to the Amazon, has a yellowish pulp that's a great source of vitamin B1 and zinc. While jenipapo can be consumed as a fresh juice that tastes a bit like dried apricots, try ordering licor de jenipapo, an infused cachaça liqueur served in small bars and botecos. While açaí has become a global wellness trend, the version served in the Amazon bears little resemblance to the frozen bowls found abroad. What many travellers don't realise is that there are seven distinct açaí palm species. Locals distinguish between açaí-do-Pará, açaí-do-mato and juçara, depending on region. In Belém, for example, vendors use pneumatic presses to extract the berry's thick, purplish pulp – sold in clear bags and consumed straight out of bowls with spoons, as if a purple gazpacho. Outside of its natural range in Brazil, the rest of the country enjoys the pulp prepared in yogurts and ice creams.  -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.  For more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.  Copyright 2025 BBC.

6/8/2025,Article,News,William warns ocean life 'diminishing before our eyes',https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/c3d4387x1d0o,"The Prince of Wales has described the challenge of protecting the world's oceans as ""like none that we have ever faced before."" In a speech delivered to the Blue Economy and Finance Forum in Monaco, Prince William said life on the ocean floor was ""diminishing before our eyes"" and called for ambitious action ""on a global, national and local level"". At the Grimaldi Forum, named after Monaco's royal family, the Prince spoke in both English and French as he laid out what was at risk. ""The truth is that healthy oceans are essential to all life on earth. They generate half of the world's oxygen, regulate our climate and provide food for more than three billion people,"" he said. Rising temperatures, pollution and overfishing are causing huge damage to the world's oceans and the communities that rely on them. The forum comes ahead of the UN Ocean Conference in Nice, France, this week, with the events looking at the role oceans play in global trade, food security and sustainable energy. In Monaco on Sunday, the Prince was speaking to an audience of environmentalists, scientists and investors – many of whom have travelled there with a view to financing ocean protection projects. Prince William acknowledged that investing in ocean work can be a tricky proposition for investors. ""All too often, it can feel distant and disconnected from our everyday lives, allowing us to forget just how vital it is,"" he said. ""We must realise the potential of the blue economy for our ecosystems, our economies and our communities."" The Prince was speaking as founder of the Earthshot Prize, which gives out five £1m prizes each year for the best solutions to the greatest climate challenges. Several Earthshot winners and past finalists were in the audience. Enric Sala, of the National Geographic Society's Pristine Seas project, was a finalist in 2021 and has pioneered work to protect marine life. He is also part of the team that has produced Sir David Attenborough's new film, Oceans, which Prince William described as ""the most compelling argument for immediate action I have ever seen"". ""Watching human activity reduce beautiful sea forests to barren deserts at the base of our oceans is heartbreaking,"" the Prince said. ""For many, it is an urgent wake up call to just what is going on in our oceans. But it can no longer be a matter of 'out of sight, out of mind'."" He ended his speech saying action was needed for future generations and quoted Sir David. ""If we save the sea, we save our world."" The Prince interviewed Sir David at the premiere of Oceans last month, with the film described by its producer as ""the greatest message [Sir David] has ever told"". Kensington Palace described the speech as a ""landmark intervention"" by Prince William, using his platform to generate change and bring in investments to scale up ocean solutions. While in southern France, the Prince met President Chavez of Costa Rica, France's President Macron and Prince Albert of Monaco - a supporter of many oceans projects and a key player at the forum. Prince William will also attend a closed session, held in private, with ocean experts and investors. Additional reporting by Adam Hale. Copyright 2025 BBC.

6/9/2025,Article,News,Curfew and internet shutdown in India's violence-hit Manipur state ,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/cy4k52q283zo,"Authorities have imposed a curfew and shut down the internet in parts of the troubled north-eastern Indian state of Manipur after protests erupted over the arrest of leaders from an ethnic group. On Sunday, police arrested five leaders of Arambai Tenggol, an armed Meitei radical group, including their chief Asem Kanan Singh. India's top investigation agency said Singh was arrested at Manipur's Imphal airport for his involvement in ""various criminal activities"" related to the violence that broke out in the state in 2023. Manipur has been rocked by periodic violence since 2023 after ethnic clashes between the two largest groups, the majority Meitei and minority Kuki, over land and influence.  More than 250 people have been killed in the conflict, with tens of thousands displaced. Arambai Tenggol identifies itself as a social outfit and wields considerable influence in the state, enjoying support from the Meitei community. The latest round of tensions began on 7 June, when India's top investigation agency arrested Singh and four other leaders of Arambai Tenggol, following which he was taken to Guwahati city in the neighbouring state of Assam. The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), which is investigating cases related to violence in Manipur, said that the trial for these had been shifted from Manipur to Guwahati in Assam ""in view of the law and order situation in Manipur"". After the arrests, protesters demanding the release of members of Arambai Tenggol stormed a police post, set fire to a bus and blocked roads in parts of Imphal.  Some protesters also clashed with security personnel, The Hindu newspaper reported.  A 13-year-old boy was injured after security forces fired tear gas shells and live rounds to disperse crowds, The Hindustan Times reported. State lawmaker Okram Surjakumar said the arrests had thrown the state into chaos. Following the violence, the state government suspended internet and mobile data services in five districts of the state for five days and imposed an indefinite curfew in one. Gatherings of four or more people has also been prohibited in the some parts. Arambai Tenggol has also declared a 10-day shutdown in parts of the state since Saturday night.  Priyanka Gandhi, leader of the opposition Congress party, on Sunday questioned why the government was unable to bring to peace to the conflict-hit state. Earlier this year, the Indian government brought the state under direct federal rule after the chief minister resigned following criticism from opposition groups. Gandhi blamed Prime Minister Narendra Modi, saying he had not met representatives from the state or made any efforts for peace. ""It is the prime minister's responsibility to ensure peace and security for the citizens of the country. To step back from this is to turn away from one's duty,"" she wrote in a post on X. The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has been sharply criticised by opposition leaders and rights groups for its handling of the conflict. Opposition leaders have also criticised Modi for not visiting the state since the violence first began in 2023.  On Sunday, a multi-party delegation of state lawmakers met the state governor. BJP lawmker Kh Ibomcha said the delegation had asked that the arrested leaders be released after they were questioned by the police. Copyright 2025 BBC.

6/9/2025,Article,News,Missing Indian bride arrested for allegedly murdering husband on honeymoon,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/ckgn50p90epo,"Police in India say a woman, who had gone missing after her husband was found brutally murdered during their honeymoon, is in custody after she surrendered. The families of the couple had alleged that the bride had also either been killed or abducted and mounted a huge campaign to find her. Police now allege that Sonam Raghuvanshi, 25, hired killers to murder her 30-year-old husband Raja during their trip to the tiny north-eastern state of Meghalaya. Four men have also been arrested. Sonam's father Devi Singh has defended his daughter saying ""she is innocent and she cannot do this"". The newly-wed couple from Indore city in the central state of Madhya Pradesh had chosen Meghalaya for their honeymoon because they had heard it had ""very beautiful valleys"", Raja's brother Sachin Raghuvanshi told the BBC at the weekend, before Sonam's arrest. The couple had married on 11 May in Indore in a ceremony blessed by both their families.  ""Their marriage was arranged four months back and they were both happy and there had been no fights between the couple before or after marriage,"" Raja's other brother Vipin Raghuvanshi said. The couple left for Meghalaya on 20 May. But four days into their trip, they went missing.  Police and disaster relief teams, accompanied by local people, searched for the couple. Videos from the area showed rescuers rappelling down hills and cliffs in valleys covered in mist. Officials said rain and low visibility were hampering the search operations. A week later, Raja's decomposed body was found in a gorge with his throat slit and his wallet, a gold ring and a chain missing. And Sonam had disappeared without a trace.  Their families mounted a huge campaign, accusing the Meghalaya police of not doing enough to solve Raja's murder or find Sonam - an accusation contested by the state's chief minister. The couple's families demanded that the case be handed over to the federal police for a proper investigation and met influential caste leaders and federal ministers in their home state to lobby for this. Last Friday, they also wrote a letter addressed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to deliver justice for Raja and find Sonam. But on Monday morning, Director General of Meghalaya police Idashisha Nongrang said Sonam had surrendered at a police station in Uttar Pradesh's Ghazipur district. Three other suspects, who are also from the couple's home state Madhya Pradesh, have been arrested in overnight raids, DGP Nongrang said. ""One person was picked up from Uttar Pradesh and another two accused were apprehended from Indore. Sonam surrendered at the Nandganj police station and was subsequently arrested."" Later, addressing a press conference, Superintendent of Police Vivek Syiem said a fourth man had been arrested in Meghalaya in connection with the case on Monday morning. He did not give any motive for Raja's murder but described Sonam ""as the main suspect"". In response to a reporter's question on ""whether Sonam was in an extra-marital relationship with one of the arrested men"", Mr Syeim said ""if you join the dots, then it would seem like it"". But he added that these details could be verified only after the two were questioned. Sonam's father Devi Singh told ANI news agency that his daughter had reached ""a dhaba [roadside eatery] in Ghazipur last night where she borrowed a mobile phone and called her brother - who then called the police"". Mr Singh said he had not been able to speak to his daughter but he believed that she had ""somehow managed to escape her captors"" and insisted that she was ""innocent"". Mr Singh also accused the Meghalaya police of ""making up stories"" and appealed to Home Minister Amit Shah to order a federal inquiry into the case for the truth to come out. Raja's brother Vipin Raghuvanshi initially told reporters he would ""not accept Sonam's involvement in the murder until she confessed"".  But he later said that one of the arrested men named by the police worked in Sonam's office. ""Only Sonam can clarify,"" he said. ""If she's guilty, she should be punished."" Mr Raghuvanshi, who had repeatedly criticised Meghalaya's police and government for not doing enough to solve the case, also said ""I now believe that Meghalaya government was not lying. They were telling the truth"". On Monday morning, after the news broke, Meghalaya Chief Minister Conrad Sangma complimented his state's police force, saying that they had achieved a ""major breakthrough"" in seven days. Another minister, Alexander Laloo Hek, said that the state's police, government and even ordinary people had been unfairly blamed while the search was going on. ""The truth has come out,"" he said.

6/9/2025,Article,News,'We were friends of the US': Fearful Afghans face Trump travel ban,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/czel9dgxl6no,"Ahmad has been hiding in Afghanistan for years. The former Afghan military employee is living in fear of being found by the Taliban, which seized power in 2021 as US forces withdrew from the Central Asian nation. As a result, Ahmad is unable to get a job or access medical care, relying on donations from friends outside the country to survive. His son, 12, is unable to go to school. If they are found, Ahmad says, the Taliban ""will remove"" him. His hope had been refugee resettlement in the US, but - with just a medical check to complete - the process was put on pause by the Trump administration. Still, he hoped. Then, on Thursday he woke to the news that US President Donald Trump had issued a new order banning the entry of Afghan passport holders to the US, citing national security threats. ""I am not a threat to the United States,"" Ahmad told the BBC. The BBC is not using his real name because of concerns about his safety. ""We were friends of the United States,"" he added. Trump's sweeping travel ban came into force on Monday, blocking people from  Afghanistan and 11 other countries, including seven from Africa, as well as countries like Haiti and Yemen, from entering the US. There are partial bans on seven other countries. According to the ban, Afghanistan was included because the Taliban are considered by the US government to be a Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT) group, and the country does not have ""a competent or co-operative central authority for issuing passports or civil documents"", or ""appropriate screening and vetting measures"". It also notes a relatively high rate of people overstaying their visas. The Trump administration has, however, recently dropped temporary protected status for more than 9,000 Afghans living in the US, arguing its assessments showed the security and economic situation in Afghanistan had improved. But those living in Afghanistan are faced with a series of restrictions brought in by the Taliban government in line with its strict interpretation of Sharia law. The ones affecting women - including the enforcement of head coverings, restrictions on travel and education over the age of 12 - amount to a ""gender apartheid"", according to the United Nations. The Taliban says it respects the rights of women in line with Sharia and Afghan culture. A different UN report from 2023 found there were credible reports that hundreds of former government officials and armed forces members had been killed since the group returned to power in 2021, despite a general amnesty. The Taliban has previously said all Afghans could ""live in the country without any fear"" - and those abroad should come back and help rebuild the country. ""There is a general amnesty,"" Mohammad Suhail Shaheen, Taliban ambassador to Qatar, told the BBC earlier this year. ""Countrywide security is prevalent in Afghanistan. Every citizen and traveller can travel to any corner of the country without any obstacles or any difficulties."" There are exceptions to Trump's ban - including for Afghans who worked directly with the US military before the Taliban back took control of the country in 2021. But Ahmad, whose application for resettlement was backed by a former US service member, does not qualify for a Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) because he did not work directly for the US. And he is far from the only one. Some 200,000 Afghans have been resettled since the US military's chaotic withdrawal, but there are still tens of thousands more waiting for a decision. Many have fled across the border to neighbouring Pakistan to wait for a decision to be made on their application. Samira, who spoke to the BBC's Afghan Service, is currently in Pakistan - which has been expelling tens of thousands of Afghans in recent months. If the path to the US is closed to her, she is not sure what to do next. ""Returning to Afghanistan is not an option for us - it would be incredibly challenging,"" she said. ""Our children have already lost years of education, and we have no hope of safely going back."" More than 8,300 family members of US citizens are ready for an interview in Afghanistan, with more than 11,400 others awaiting family reunification, according to US Department of State data shared by AfghanEvac. Mojo, who asked to be identified by his nickname, is one of the 200,000 Afghans who have already reached the US, because he worked directly for the US military. He is now a US citizen. His sister, however, remains in Afghanistan where she and her husband are ""living in a hide and seek game"", he says. They change their address and city every couple months in order to stay safe. They passed the background and medical checks for refugee resettlement, but like the others who spoke to the BBC, they became trapped when the process was paused in January. This latest order has made Mojo, who lives in Houston, Texas, and the rest of his family lose ""all our hope completely"" . ""I wish that he would change his mind, make some exception, change the rules or take his order back and let people have a peaceful life,"" he said. The ban also affects Afghans who are not trying to reach the US for resettlement. Zarifa Ghafari is studying at Cornell University in New York state, but is currently in Germany for the summer with her young child. She said she began a ""frantic"" race back to the US on Thursday in order to continue her studies, before the start of the travel ban on Monday. The ban has put her under ""immense pressure"" and has made her feel ""very vulnerable"", the the 30-year-old former politician told the BBC. What makes it worse, she said, was that she regularly had to return to Germany every few months to maintain her residency status there too. Describing her situation as ""precarious"", she said she worried about how she could make her regular trips to Germany when the travel ban began. Shawn VanDiver, of AfghanEvac, said the ban broke a promise Americans had made to Afghans over the 20 years they were in the country. ""This policy punishes people who escaped the Taliban, risked everything to support democracy, are already vetted, were told by the US government to wait,"" he wrote on social media platform X. ""They're not threats. They're our allies - and they're being left behind."" Meanwhile, many of those still in Afghanistan have other problems to contend with. As one Afghan man in Kabul told AFP news agency: ""We don't even have bread, why are you asking me about travelling to America?""

6/9/2025,Article,News,South Korea cements cultural status with six Tonys for Maybe Happy Ending,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/cy0j71xgrv8o,"South Koreans are celebrating their first win in the Tony Awards, which they say highlights their country's status as a cultural powerhouse. The acclaimed Broadway production of Maybe Happy Ending, which debuted in South Korea almost a decade ago, won six Tonys, including best musical. Maybe Happy Ending is about the romance between two humanoid robots living in an apartment building on the outskirts of Seoul. It entered Sunday night's awards ceremony with 10 nominations. With the Tonys, South Koreans have now won the four most coveted awards in US entertainment. Squid Game won Emmy awards in 2022 while Parasite won four Oscars in 2020. Soprano Sumi Jo won a Grammy in 1993. On Sunday, South Korean lyricist Hue Park and American composer Will Aronson took home the Tony for best original score and best book of a musical. Before making their Broadway debut with Maybe Happy Ending in 2024, the pair, who met as students at New York University, had written the musical in both English and Korean. ""This is amazing!"" one post on Threads reads. ""I heard the Broadway version got even more polished. I'm so proud that Korea is becoming a true cultural powerhouse."" ""This feels like a dream come true for the Korean Wave,"" reads another post. ""I'm just as thrilled as when Parasite won the Oscars, Squid Game won the Emmys, and Han Kang received the Nobel Prize."" Former Glee star Darren Criss, who played one of the robots, Oliver, won best lead actor in a musical. It was his first Tony win. The musical, which also stars Helen J Shen as robot Claire, was already on a streak this awards season. It bagged some of the top prizes at the Outer Critics Circle Awards and Drama League Awards this year. First directed by Kim Dong-yeon, Maybe Happy Ending premiered in Seoul in 2016 to much critical acclaim. It has since been revived several times in South Korea and abroad - in both Korean and English. Maybe Happy Ending's success comes as South Korean artists continue to break ground in entertainment, especially with K-pop acts like BTS and Blackpink dominating music in the last few years. It also serves as a window into Korean culture, some social media users say. ""It's amazing that Korean elements like Jeju Island, fireflies, and hwabun (a plant pot) were kept in the Broadway version too,"" reads one post on Threads.  ""I already felt proud just seeing it nominated, but watching the local audience react so positively made it even more special."" Copyright 2025 BBC.

6/9/2025,Article,News,Unlawful assembly declared in downtown LA as protests escalate,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/c87jnnj1pxno,"Protests against immigration raids in Los Angeles escalated on Sunday as US President Donald Trump called to ""bring in the troops"".   Rising unrest saw a major freeway blocked and a row of self-driving cars set on fire as law enforcement used tear gas, rubber bullets and flash bangs to control the crowd. Police called downtown LA an ""unlawful assembly"" area at 23:15 local time on Sunday (07:15 BST on Monday) after three days of protests and dozens of arrests.  Demonstrations began outside the Federal Building, in downtown LA, on Friday after it emerged Immigration Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers were carrying out raids across the city. California Governor Gavin Newsom, along with the LA mayor Karen Bass, said in separate comments on Saturday that they believed local police could handle the protests. But on Saturday night, after two days of clashes between demonstrators and immigration authorities, Trump went against Newsom's wishes and ordered the deployment of 2,000 National Guard.  On Sunday morning, the first group of troops began arriving in the city, staging outside a detention centre where illegal immigrants are taken once detained. Newsom called Trump's decision to deploy soldiers ""illegal"" and ""immoral"" and threatened to sue the administration. ""Donald Trump has created the conditions you see on your TV tonight... he's putting fuel on this fire,"" he said in an interview with MSNBC on Sunday evening as tensions flared. ""[It's] an unconstitutional act, and we're going to test that theory with a lawsuit tomorrow,"" Newsom added. Typically, a state's National Guard force is activated at the request of the governor. In this case, Trump has circumvented that step by invoking a specific provision of the US Code of Armed Services titled 10 U.S.C. 12406, which lists three circumstances under which the president can ""federalise"" the National Guard. Pockets of the city were thrown into chaos on Sunday night, with repeated bangs heard as police faced off with protesters.  Many of those involved were carrying Mexican flags or signs deriding federal immigration authorities, who arrested 118 unauthorised immigrants across LA on Friday - according to CBS, which cited information from ICE.   A row of self-driving Waymo vehicles - that serve as taxis in LA - had their tyres slashed, windows smashed and exteriors spray painted before they were torched by protesters.  Multiple patrol vehicles blocking a highway were damaged when protesters hurled objects - including E-scooters - at them. Fires were started across the city as protesters lit large fireworks. Several businesses reported looting late in the night, the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) said.  Many downtown streets were littered with debris, glass, cinder blocks and burn marks.  Buildings were covered in new graffiti, much of which contained graphic language against immigration enforcement.  In one particularly chaotic scene, a van driving erratically veered into a large group of protesters and appeared to hit several people. The driver, who was shirtless, was later arrested and police said he would face multiple charges. The same day, an Australian news reporter was filmed being struck by what appeared to be a rubber bullet fired by law enforcement. And a British photographer underwent emergency surgery after being struck in the leg by another non-lethal bullet. The BBC has asked the LAPD for comment. Police said they made 27 arrests, on top of the 29 on Saturday. Separately, at least 60 people were taken in at related protests in San Francisco. On his Truth Social platform on Sunday, Trump called for an end to the protests. In one post, he wrote: ""Looking really bad in L.A. BRING IN THE TROOPS!!!"" It is unclear which troops Trump was referring to as National Guard soldiers have already arrived, following his instruction. On Saturday evening, Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth threatened to activate the US Marine Corps if protests persisted.  He posted on X: ""Under President Trump, violence & destruction against federal agents & federal facilities will NOT be tolerated. It's COMMON SENSE. The @DeptofDefense is mobilizing the National Guard IMMEDIATELY to support federal law enforcement in Los Angeles. And, if violence continues, active duty Marines at Camp Pendleton will also be mobilized - they are on high alert."" Jose Barrera, the national vice president of the League of United Latin American citizens (LULAC), told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the White House wanted ""to create civic unrest"" in LA.  Barrera said there was ""no need"" for Trump to deploy the National Guard when there are 17,000 police personnel in the city.  He says deploying the troops ""increases tensions"" and confrontation, which set a ""dangerous precedent"". In a statement, the White House said that Trump ""rightfully stepped in to restore law and order because of Gavin Newsom's feckless leadership and his refusal to stop the violent attacks on American law enforcement"".

6/9/2025,Article,News,Kenya police barred from work after man dies in custody ,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/cwy3eqpqqnzo,"Kenyan police officers who were on duty when a man died in custody at a police station have been barred from returning to work pending the outcome of investigations.  Albert Ojwang was arrested on Friday after Kenya's deputy police chief accused him of tarnishing his name, police Inspector-General Douglas Kanja confirmed. ""While in custody, the suspect sustained head injuries after hitting his head against a cell wall,"" a police statement said. He was rushed to hospital ""where he was pronounced dead on arrival"". The director of Amnesty International's Kenya branch told the BBC that  Mr Ojwang's death was ""very suspicious"". Amnesty said in a statement that it ""raises serious questions that must be urgently, thoroughly, and independently investigated"". Senior police officer Stephen Okal is quoted by the Star newspaper as saying what happened in the cell was ""an attempted suicide"". Mr Ojwang, described in media reports as a teacher and blogger, was arrested in the western town of Homa Bay and then driven 350km (220 miles) to the capital, Nairobi, his father Meshack Opiyo told journalists. He had been accused of ""false publication"",with Mr Opiyo telling online news site Citizen Digital that the arresting police officer said ""Albert had insulted a senior person on X"", the social media platform. A police statement said the officers who were on duty at the time - including the head of the police station - were ""interdicted"" to allow Kenya's independent oversight body to conduct an ""impartial investigation"". This meant that the officers could not perform their duties, and would receive half their salaries, pending the outcome of the investigation, police spokesman Michael Muchiri told the BBC. Speaking at a press conference, Mr Kanja said the police would give the investigators all ""necessary support"" to resolve the case. He said Mr Ojwang was arrested in Homa Bay on Friday, then transferred to Nairobi for questioning and booked at the police station on Saturday. According to the police chief, Mr Ojwang was found unconscious during a routine inspection of the cells, and was taken to a hospital where he was pronounced dead on arrival. He said the arrest had been prompted by a complaint by deputy police chief Eliud Lagat ""about his name being tarnished"". ""It was on that basis that investigations were actually being carried out,"" the police chief added. The head of the Independent Police Oversight Commission (Ipoa), Ahmed Isaack Hassan, has said his team will do ""everything to ensure justice is served for the family and for all Kenyans"".  Mr Hassan, who attended the press conference, called on officers not to interfere with the investigations. A post-mortem examination was scheduled to be carried out on Monday. The death of Mr Ojwang, who was reported to have been 31, has sparked outrage online and calls for protests to demand police accountability. Referring to the circumstances of his arrest, Amnesty Kenya director Irungu Houghton said it was ""quite shocking"" that Mr Ojwang was not booked in at the local police station after being detained, but was instead taken on a long journey. He called on the independent investigators to secure what he described as ""the crime scene"" at the police station in Nairobi. Ojwang's detention and death comes at a time of rising concern about how some government critics are being treated.  Last week, software developer Rose Njeri - who created a tool to help people oppose a government finance bill - was charged with violating a cybercrime law.

6/9/2025,Article,Sport,Spurs close in on Frank as next head coach,https://www.bbc.com//sport/football/articles/c9918zm75v0o,"Thomas Frank has been at Brentford since 2018 Tottenham are moving towards appointing Brentford boss Thomas Frank as their new head coach following the sacking of Ange Postecoglou. Brentford are expecting a formal approach from Tottenham in the coming days but there has been no confirmation so far of dialogue between the two clubs. The Dane, 51, has emerged as a leading contender to replace Postecoglou. Brentford would be entitled to compensation for Frank, with sources indicating it would cost Tottenham more than Â£10m to extract him from his contract which runs until 2027. That figure could rise depending on how many members of staff Frank decides to bring with him if he is named Spurs boss. Postecoglou was sacked on Friday, 16 days after leading them to victory in the Europa League final, their first major trophy for 17 years. However, it came towards the end of their worst Premier League season, as they finished 17th after losing 22 of their 38 matches. Frank took over at Brentford in 2018 and guided them into the Premier League, winning the Championship play-off final at Wembley in 2021 and establishing them as a top-flight club on a small budget. Brentford finished 10th in the Premier League this season, seven places and 18 points above Spurs. Meanwhile, Tottenham are expected to confirm the departure of chief football officer Scott Munn this week. The Australian administrator, who joined Spurs in 2023, is understood to have left the north London club amid an internal reshuffle. Munn was a key figure in the appointment of fellow Australian Postecoglou in June 2023. Vinai Venkatesham started in his role as new chief executive last Monday, while executive director Donna Cullen left the club. Munn's exit is another significant change in what is gearing up to be a crucial summer for Tottenham ahead of next season. In addition to their search for new men's and women's head coaches, Fabio Paratici, the club's former managing director of football, is in talks over a return to the club once his Fifa ban for alleged financial irregularities linked to his time at Juventus expires in July. The Italian has been working with Spurs on a consultancy basis during his suspension, with the process towards his permanent reappointment ongoing. There has been interest from the Middle East in Paratici, but it is understood he is keen to rejoin Tottenham. Copyright Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

6/9/2025,Article,News,Trump-Musk row heightens fears over Nasa budget cuts,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/c87jq0djw00o,"The row between US President Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk over a major spending bill has exacerbated uncertainty over the future of Nasa's budget, which was already facing deep cuts. The White House had requested huge cuts to the space agency's budget, which would see funding for science projects cut by nearly a half. Now the president has threatened to withdraw federal contracts with Musk's company, Space X, further jeopardising the US space programme. Nasa relies on the firm's Falcon 9 rocket fleet to resupply the International Space Station with crew and supplies. The space agency also expects to use its Starship rocket to send astronauts to the Moon and eventually to Mars once it has been developed. Dr Simeon Barber, a space scientist at the Open University, said that the uncertainty was having a ""chilling impact"" on the human space programme. ""The astonishing exchanges, snap decisions and U-turns we've witnessed in the last week undermine the very foundations that we build our ambitions on. ""Space science and exploration relies upon long term planning and cooperation between government, companies and academic institutions."" Even before the feud between Trump and Musk, there was concern about the proposed cuts. Forty science missions, which are in development or in space already, are in line to be stood down. All sectors have been earmarked for savings, apart from an effort to send astronauts to Mars, which has received a $100m (£74m) boost. According to Casey Dreier, chief of space policy for the Pasadena-based Planetary Society, which promotes space exploration, the potential cuts represent ""the biggest crisis ever to face the US space programme"". Nasa has published details of how it plans to make the cuts requested by the White House in its budget request to Congress, proposing a reduction by nearly a quarter. The agency says the plan ""aligns [its] science and technology portfolios to missions essential for the exploration of the Moon and Mars"". Dr Adam Baker, a space analyst at Cranfield University, told BBC News that if these proposals are approved by Congress, it would fundamentally shift the agency's focus. ""President Trump is repurposing Nasa for two things: to land astronauts on the Moon before the Chinese and to have astronauts plant a US flag on Mars. Everything else is secondary."" Those who back the proposals say the White House's budget has given Nasa a clear purpose, for the first time since the days of the Apollo Moon landings of the 1960s and 70s, when the aim was to beat the Soviet Union to the Moon.  Nasa's critics say that, since then, the space agency has become a bloated, unfocussed bureaucracy which routinely goes massively over budget in its space missions and wastes taxpayer's money.  One of the most egregious examples of this is Nasa's new rocket for its plans to return American astronauts to the Moon, the Space Launch System (SLS). Its development has been delayed, and costs have spiralled such that it costs $4.1bn (£3.3bn) for each and every launch.  By contrast, SpaceX's equivalent rocket system, Starship, is estimated to cost around $100m (£80m) per launch because it is designed to be reusable. Jeff Bezos's Blue Origin space company promises similar savings for its proposed New Glenn rocket. To no one's surprise, SLS will be phased out under the White House proposals, in the hope that Starship and New Glenn can take its place. But the past three development launches of Starship have been unsuccessful, and Blue Origin has only recently begun to test its Moon rocket. ""The worry is that Nasa may be jumping out of the frying pan, into the fire,"" says Dr Barber. ""The development of these alternatives to SLS is being bankrolled by Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos.  ""If they lose their appetite for this endeavor and SpaceX or Blue Origin say they need more money to develop their systems, Congress will have to give it to them."" Of greater concern, says Dr Barber, is the potential loss of 40 missions to explore other planets and to monitor the impact of climate change on Earth from space, many of which involve collaborations with international partners. ""I think it is very sad that what has taken so long to build can be knocked down with a wrecking ball so quickly with no plan to rebuild it afterwards."" The projects facing the axe include dozens of planetary missions already in space for which most of the development and launch costs have already been paid for, with relatively small savings proposed on their operating costs. Also under threat are two collaborations with the European Space Agency: an ambitious plan to bring martian rocks collected by Nasa's Perseverance rover back to Earth and a mission to send Europe's Rosalind Franklin rover to the red planet to search for signs of past life. Prof Sir Martin Sweeting, head of the UK space firm Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd and co-author of a Royal Society report on the future of space, says that while the development was ""unwelcome"", there may be an upside for Europe as it takes greater responsibility for its own space exploration programme. ""Maybe we have been too reliant on Nasa [as] the big player to carry a lot of the emphasis in space,"" he told BBC News. ""It is an opportunity to think about how Europe wants to get a better balance in its space activities."" But there is much more downside for Europe in the short term. As well as the return of Mars samples and its rover, the ESA risks reduced access to the International Space Station if it is wound down, and the budget cuts cancel Nasa's extensive contributions to its successor, the Lunar Gateway, a multinational space station planned for orbit around the Moon. In its recently published strategy the ESA stated it ""will be seeking to build a more autonomous space capability, and to continue being a reliable, strong and desirable partner with space agencies from around the globe"", with the implication that it would do so with or without Nasa. Also facing cuts are numerous current and proposed Earth Observation programmes, according to Dr Baker. ""These Earth Observation programmes are our canary in the coal mine,"" he told BBC News. ""Our ability to predict the impact of climate change and mitigate against it could be drastically reduced. If we turn off this early warning system it is a frightening prospect."" The budget proposals have yet to be approved by Congress. The Planetary Society's Casey Dreier has told BBC News that many Republicans have told lobbyists privately that they are prepared to vote against the cuts. But, Mr Dreier worries that there is a strong possibility that political gridlock might mean that no budget is agreed.  It is likely that the reduced White House budget would be put in place as an interim measure, which then could not easily be reversed, because once space missions are turned off it is hard, if not impossible, to start them up again.

6/9/2025,Article,News,Xbox finally reveals handheld console after a decade of speculation,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/c1de113lkdpo,"Microsoft has finally revealed its highly-anticipated handheld console, years after it was first rumoured. The ROG Xbox Ally will let gamers access their Game Pass subscription library on-the-go, in effect meaning members will start off with hundreds of games. It is being made in partnership with Asus, which has been making handheld gaming devices since 2023, and will be released at the end of 2025 - though it is unknown what it will cost. Speculation over Microsoft making a handheld Xbox has been widespread for more than a decade, with the company starting and scrapping various efforts over the years. Microsoft's announcement comes just three days after the launch of the Switch 2. Much like its predecessor, the Switch 2 is a hybrid gaming device - meaning it can be both played on-the-go and connect to a TV. Its success likely led to the design of Valve's Steam Deck, a handheld PC which gives gamers access to the entire library of titles they've bought through game distribution service Steam - though not all the games work on the device. It means Microsoft may be accused of being slightly late to the game when rivals already exist in the space, but the benefit of native support for Game Pass will likely address a lot of concerns for its 34 million subscribers. Microsoft's new handheld will comes in two flavours, the ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X. ""Whether you're at home or on the go, your favorite games should follow you,"" said Xbox head of gaming devices Roanne Sones. ""Both handhelds allow players to play natively, via the cloud, or remotely with their Xbox console in another room."" The two versions both share a 7 inch screen with 1080p resolution. The base version comes with 16GB memory and 512GB storage, while the ""X"" version has 24GB memory and double the storage. The more powerful version of the handheld also has a bigger battery and a more powerful processor. In both cases, Xbox will be hoping to convince players that it offers something out of the box that its rivals don't - Microsoft's operating system.  ""Because these handhelds run Windows, you have access to games you can't get elsewhere, so you can enjoy the full freedom and versatility of PC gaming,"" said Ms Sones. In other words, gamers can leave the Xbox app and launch other gaming platforms - such as Steam and EA Play - through the device. But all that capability comes at a cost when it comes to weight. At 670g and 715g respectively, the base and X versions of the Xbox Ally may be heavier than handheld gamers are used to - with Nintendo's new Switch 2 weighing a fair bit less at 534g. And there remains one big unanswered question - the price. Microsoft decided not to reveal how much its new handheld will cost, but it goes without saying the more powerful X version will also be more expensive. The Switch 2, which has a similar screen, retails at £395 in the UK, while the Steam Deck costs between £349 and £569 depending on the specs. Part of the success of Game Pass is many highly-anticipated new releases appear on the service on launch day, meaning gamers can save money by subscribing - though you lose access to a game if you cancel your subscription. At its showcase event where it unveiled the new handheld, Microsoft announced several new games - including a reveal that 17 new titles will come to Game Pass PC & Ultimate on day one. Many of these are highly-anticipated games such as Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4, Ninja Gaiden 4 and Outer Worlds 2. It also includes the new Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 when that releases - likely later this year. The new game will be a sequel to the critically-acclaimed Black Ops 2, which first released in 2012. Interestingly, while the game was confirmed for several consoles, there was no mention of the Switch 2 at the event - despite Nintendo previously signing a 10-year deal to bring the series to its consoles in 2022. But there's something else which many gaming fans will have been excited to finally see revealed. The much-anticipated Persona 4 remake, subtitled Revival, is set to be remade 17 years after it was first released on PlayStation 2. The original, which sees a group of friends investigate a series of murders in the Japanese countryside, is considered a gaming classic. But fans of the series will have to wait, as Sega and Atlus did not share a release date for the remake. Sign up for our Tech Decoded newsletter to follow the world's top tech stories and trends.

6/9/2025,Article,News,Doctors trialling 'poo pills' to flush out dangerous superbugs,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/clyge290l4xo,"UK doctors are attempting to clear dangerous superbug infections using ""poo pills"" containing freeze-dried faeces. The stool samples come from healthy donors and are packed with good bacteria. Early data suggests superbugs can be flushed out of the dark murky depths of the bowel and replaced with a mix of healthy gut bacteria. It is a new approach to tackling infections that resist antibiotics, which are thought to kill a million people each year. The focus is on the bowels which are ""the biggest reservoir of antibiotic resistance in humans"" says Dr Blair Merrick, who has been testing the pills at Guys and St Thomas' hospitals. Drug-resistant superbugs can escape their intestinal home and cause trouble elsewhere in the body – such as urinary tract or bloodstream infections. ""So there's a lot of interest in 'can you get rid of them from the gut?',"" says Dr Merrick. The idea of poo-pills isn't as far-fetched as it might seem. Faecal transplants – also known  as a trans-poo-tion - are already approved for treating severe diarrhoea caused by Clostridium difficile bacteria. But scientists noticed hints that faecal transplants for C. difficile also seemed to get rid of superbugs. New research has focused on patients who had an infection caused by drug-resistant bacteria in the past six months. They were given pills made from faeces which people had donated to a stool bank. Each stool sample is tested to ensure it does not contain any harmful bugs, undigested food is removed and then it is freeze dried into a powder. This is stored inside a pill that can pass through the stomach unscathed and reach the intestines where it dissolves to release its poopy powdery payload. The trial has taken place on 41 patients at Guy's and St Thomas' hospitals in London to lay the groundwork for a large-scale study.  It showed patients were up for taking a poo pill and the donated bacteria were still being detected in the bowels at least a month later. Dr Merrick says there are ""really promising signals"" that poo pills could help tackle the rising scourge of superbugs and that donor bacteria could be going to microbial war with the superbugs as they compete over food and space on the lining of the gut and either rid the body of them completely or ""reduce them down to a level that doesn't cause problems"". The study also suggests the array of gut bacteria becomes more varied after the therapy. This is a sign of good health and ""may well be promoting colonisation resistance"" so it is harder for new infectious bugs to get in. ""It's very exciting. There's a real shift from 20 years ago where all bacteria and viruses were assumed to do you harm; to now where we realise they are completely necessary to our overall health,"" says Dr Merrick. Earlier this week scientists showed the good bacteria our bodies meet – in the hours after we are born – seem to halve the risk of young children being admitted to hospital with lung infections.  Our body's own human cells are outnumbered by the bacteria, fungi and others that live inside us - known as the microbiome. This has led to research implicating the microbiome in everything from Crohn's disease to cancer to mental health.  If poo pills are proven to work against superbugs in larger studies then the researchers think they could be used for both treatment and prevention in people at risk.  Medical procedures that suppress the immune system - including cancer therapies and organ transplants - can make the body more vulnerable. ""A lot of these individuals come to a lot of harm from drug resistant organisms,"" Dr Merrick. The UK's drugs regulator – the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) – said there were more than 450 microbiome medicines currently in development. ""Some of them will succeed, so I do think we will see them coming through quite soon,"" said Dr Chrysi Sergaki, the head of microbiome research at the MHRA. ""We could potentially, in the future, replace antibiotics with microbiome [therapies] - that's the big picture, so there's a lot of potential."" Copyright 2025 BBC.

6/9/2025,Article,News,Glastonbury capacity cut to avoid overcrowding,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/czelkz39k33o,"Glastonbury Festival has sold ""a few thousand less tickets"" this year in an attempt to ease the build-up of heavy crowds, organiser Emily Eavis has said. This year's event, which will take place in Somerset later this month, is sold out but will not use its full 210,000 capacity. ""It'll be interesting just to see how that affects the dynamics on site,"" Eavis told the BBC's Sidetracked podcast, adding that she wants to see if the reduction ""can make an impact on some of the busier times"". She revealed they have also created more room for the audience at the Other Stage, the festival's second-biggest arena, where Charli XCX is expected to attract a huge crowd when she headlines on the Saturday night. The Shangri-La nightlife area will also have more room after the festival bought extra land, she said. Eavis said she had asked a meeting of 250 Glastonbury staff whether anyone thought the festival was overcrowded last year, and no-one put their hand up. ""And I was like, [that's] interesting, because there's a lot of talk, some people think that it was."" Festival-goers will be urged to use different routes and make use of the whole site to ease congestion. ""Interestingly, people have moved slightly differently since Covid. So they tend to move more in a herd,"" Eavis said. ""So my main thing really this year is just to communicate that there are like 10 routes to anywhere."" Organisers can predict which areas are likely to be busiest by tracking the most popular artists among fans who use the festival app's schedule planner. ""The app was really accurate last year. People plan what they're going to see. We can see what they're going to see, which is really useful for us from a crowd perspective,"" she said. This year's festival runs from Wednesday 25 June to Monday 30 June and will be headlined by Olivia Rodrigo, The 1975 and Neil Young. Its current licence allows up to 210,000 people on site including fans, staff and performers. In a wide-ranging interview with presenters Annie Macmanus and Nick Grimshaw, Eavis said they donated £5.9m to charity last year, ""the largest sum we've managed to do"". They usually ""actively try not to make a profit"", but have had to do so in the last couple of years having lost £10m due to Covid. She also revealed that they have to pay an extra £1m for extra expenses if there is wet weather, including tonnes of woodchip on the ground to stop people from slipping in the mud. The festival pays its stars ""a lot less"" than they could earn from their own major commercial gigs - but it has increased its fees in recent years, she said. ""We are paying people a lot more than we ever have but it's not as much as you would get doing Hyde Park. ""It's such a corporate world, especially in the music industry. We are offered a lot of things that we turn down."" She told the podcast: ""The whole thing is based on goodwill. ""Imagine if we tried to sell it out [to commercial brands]. It would be awful, it would be the end. I'd rather literally die before that happened. It just can't happen."" The festival's founder Michael Eavis has passed the day-to-day running of the festival to his daughter, and officially transferred his financial shares in the company to her in October 2024. He will be 90 in October and is still ""mentally completely following everything"", Emily said. ""We want to make this festival a big birthday moment for him as well."" Asked about a slot on the Pyramid Stage line-up for a mystery band called Patchwork, Eavis wouldn't be drawn on their identity. ""I've been working on Patchwork for a long time,"" she said, adding that planning for their appearance had taken about a year for ""logistical"" reasons. On Monday, social media account Secretglasto said Pulp are Patchwork, although the band's spokesman has said they are not playing. Copyright 2025 BBC.

6/9/2025,Article,Culture,Five works that reveal Banksy's hidden philosophy,https://www.bbc.com//culture/article/20250602-five-works-that-reveal-the-philosophy-of-banksy,"Banksy's new mural in Marseille is not the first image he has connected to the history of ideas. From Plato to Foucault, a Banksy expert reveals the philosophy behind these popular artworks. Which is the real you, the person you are now or the one you are capable of becoming? It's a heady question, to be sure, and not one you would expect to be confronted with while strolling down a street in Marseille in the waning days of May. Yet it's precisely the existential dilemma that Banksy, who once asserted ""being yourself is overrated"" – has surreptitiously installed in a cloistered stretch of the quiet Rue Félix Fregier, the site of a new work – the latest installment in the elusive artist's decades-long career as a provocative philosophical prankster.  For more than 30 years, Banksy has spiked many of his most iconic works – from his girl reaching hopelessly for a heart-shaped balloon to his masked rioter hurling a bouquet of flowers – with barbed allusions to Old Masters, from Michelangelo to Monet, Vermeer to Van Gogh. But there's more. Beneath his stealthy stencils lies a deep and deliberate engagement with the history of ideas as well, from classical Stoicism to postmodern deconstructionism. On 29 May, Banksy posted on Instagram a photo of his first new piece in more than five months, piquing the internet's interest by withholding its precise location. Discovered shortly thereafter in the major port city in southern France, Marseille, the mural is, at first glance, deceptively simple: a tall silhouette of a lighthouse spray-painted on to a blank beige urban wall; a rusting street bollard positioned nearby; and a painted shadow stretching across the pavement, joining the real-world object to its augmented, if two-dimensional, echo. Stencilled across the black lighthouse are the words: ""I want to be what you saw in me.""  Anyone keen to find a source for the ideas that inform Banksy's new work needs merely to flip open any history of philosophy to Plato's seminal allegory of the cave (from the Fourth-Century BC treatise The Republic), then flip the ancient metaphor on its head. In Plato's parable, prisoners chained inside a cave mistake shadows on the wall for reality, unaware of the truer forms that cast them outside. But here, Banksy, being Banksy, baits us by switching the set-up, reversing the relationship between essence and shadow. In Banksy's mural, the drab bollard casts not a diminished imitation of itself, but something far grander – a lighthouse, a symbol of illumination and guidance. Here, it's the silhouette, not reality, that's true. Banksy's inversion urges us to ask where reality really resides: in what is, or in what might be? His poignant phrase – ""I want to be what you saw in me"" – is alluringly elastic. Is this the bollard dreaming of being more than it appears? Or the shadow wishing to become light? Or is it all of us – Banksy included – struggling to live up to the better versions imagined by those who believe in us? The answer is surely yes to all of the above. And it's a yes too to the question: 'is this new work a lamp capable of shining light on further levels of meaning in Banksy?' What follows is a brief look back at some of the artist's best-known works and how they too are invigorated by, and often upend, many of the most important philosophical tenets – both social and intellectual – that underwrite who we are and who we might be. Banksy's new mural in Marseille is not the first to be accompanied by an affecting caption connecting the piece to the history of ideas. Among his most famous murals, Girl with Balloon, which portrays a child reaching towards a heart-shaped balloon drifting away from her, first appeared in 2002 in various locations in London, including on the South Bank, alongside the consoling assertion, ""there is always hope"". That conviction, which fuels the ceaseless striving for an ideal that is seemingly unobtainable in the mural (there's no way that balloon is coming back) rhymes richly with aspects of 19th-Century German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer's ideas concerning an unquenchable and irrational ""Will"" as a fundamental force that drives humanity. When, years later, Banksy mischievously concealed a remote-controlled shredder in the frame of a version of Girl with Balloon that came up for auction in 2018, and sensationally destroyed the work before the eyes of aghast auction-goers, he succeeded in upping the ante on Schopenhauer's belief in the futility of desire by boldly manifesting it himself. Where there's a will there's a fray. Banksy's famous mural of a masked man frozen forever in the instant before he unleashes not a brick or a bomb but a bouquet of flowers may seem, at first blush, to exemplify a pacifist's commitment to peaceful disobedience. The work appears to echo the precepts of Mahatma Gandhi's Satyagraha – a philosophy of non-violence that the Indian ethicist coined in 1919. Banksy's fully flexed figure, incongruously armed with a fistful of beauty, appears to epitomise Gandhi's insistence on wielding moral, not physical, strength. Doesn't it? Or has Banksy slyly subverted the philosophical assertion of pacifistic force by portraying his hero as an enraged rioter? The figure's anger has not been tempered by an appeal to the higher ideals of beauty and truth. Instead, those ideals have been weaponised by Banksy. Here, beauty and truth are not disarming, they are devastatingly explosive. Banksy's mural in Marseille employs a tried-and-true technique to ensure the work protrudes into the urban space in which we'll encounter it – elevating its philosophical potential from something flimsy and flat to something undeniably urgent. It's a tactic he used in a 2007 work that appeared near London's Oxford Street in which he depicts a boy atop a precariously high ladder, spray-painting the penetrating observation that we are ""One Nation Under CCTV"" in outlandishly outsized letters. Also portrayed within the mural is a uniformed officer and his obedient police dog who surveil the young vandal, while above them all an actual CCTV camera, presumably recording everything, juts out from the wall. The endless layers of surveillance-within-surveillance to which the work attests – as we watch the state watch an officer watch the boy – captures with uncanny precision the philosophical contours of the vast and all-encompassing prison machine in which the French poststructural philosopher Michel Foucault believed everyone in society was now irredeemably enmeshed. In Foucault's study Discipline and Punish: The Birth of the Prison, he resuscitates a blueprint for a prison proposed by the British utilitarian philosopher Jeremy Bentham at the end of the 18th Century, ""The Panopticon"" (meaning ""all seeing""), and uses it as a menacing metaphor for how no one can escape the perniciously penetrating eye of the panoptical state.  Banksy's witty 2014 work Mobile Lovers shines a chilling light on the state of contemporary relationships. The mural depicts a couple whose almost affectionate embrace is interrupted by the deeper fondness they have for the warm glow of their smartphones. The French existentialist philosopher Simone de Beauvoir, who died in 1986, may not have lived long enough to witness the emergence of mobiles. Yet her profoundly influential 1947 book The Ethics of Ambiguity – published exactly 60 years before the iPhone was launched in 2007 – with its exploration of the devastation that detachment and disconnection can wreak on the realisation of our truest selves, is profoundly proleptic of our modern predicament. To be free, de Beauvoir insisted, requires a deep attentiveness to each other. She believed in the authenticity of human encounters, without which life is a futile performance, dimly lit by disposable devices, rather than something profound and meaningful.  How Banksy Saved Art History by Kelly Grovier, published by Thames & Hudson, is out now. -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.

6/9/2025,Article,Travel,How a terrorist hotspot became a tourism gem,https://www.bbc.com//travel/article/20250606-how-georgias-pankisi-valley-rewrote-its-story,"Long overshadowed by headlines of extremism, Georgia's Pankisi Valley is now welcoming travellers with Sufi rituals, mountain trails and home-cooked Kist food. The chants start quietly. Sitting cross-legged in a circle, the women respond to one another in softly sung words of Arabic and Chechen. Words praising God, words calling for peace in the world. As their voices rise, they stand up. They begin to clap. ""ā ilāha illa ʾllāh..."" Carried by the growing rhythm, they start moving in a tight circle. Beads of sweat form on the forehead of one elderly woman who is a head shorter than the others. She keeps going. The spinning and chanting get faster and faster, louder and louder, building to a meditative, whirring trance. Then the singing breaks, and the women embrace each other. This is dhikr, a Sufi ritual that means ""remembrance"" in Arabic and is meant to bring the soul closer to Allah. Duisi, this small village in Georgia's Pankisi Valley, is the only place in the Caucasus where women perform dhikr in the mosque as men do. In a corner of the room, a small group of visitors – from the US, Europe and the Middle East – watches on. Two decades ago, few tourists would have dared set foot in Pankisi Valley. This narrow green dale in the Caucasus Mountains, home to ethnic Kists (a Muslim community with Chechen roots), had landed a reputation it struggled to shake. News reports labelled it ""notoriously lawless"" and travel advisories warned people to stay away. Today, local families are determined to do away with those stereotypes by hosting tourists and showing them the real Pankisi Valley: a place where people ride horses, make dumplings and sing echoing songs of peace and devotion. Pankisi Valley's troubled reputation dates to the early 2000s when it became a refuge for Chechens fleeing war in Russia. The Kists speak a Chechen dialect, and the valley is located just across the border from Chechnya, making it a logical destination for many refugee families. Among the civilian refugees were some militants and former soldiers, prompting unfounded rumours that members of Al Qaeda – and even Osama Bin Laden – were hiding in the valley. Under pressure from Russia and the US, the Georgian government launched anti-terrorist operations in the marginalised region. At the same time, the government's efforts failed to address the local community's economic and social struggles, as the arrival of thousands of refugees placed strain on already limited resources. ""It was only through anti-terrorist special operations that the state reminded the residents of its existence,"" wrote Georgian academics Maia Barkaia and Barbare Janelidze in a 2018 paper. The so-called ""Pankisi Crisis"" eventually subsided, and most Chechen refugees left the valley for Central and Western Europe. But years of economic and social pressure, teamed with neglect by the central government, opened the doors for ISIS influence in the 2010s, when its propaganda machine started preying on disenfranchised young people from around the world. Between 2010 and 2016, an estimated 50 to 200 people left Pankisi Valley for Syria, lured by ISIS messaging. The most infamous was Abu Omar al-Shishani, a top ISIS commander, whose origins reignited global media interest in Pankisi – once again casting it as a terrorist hotspot. Pankisi's dangerous image persists to this day, despite the fact that crime rates are very low. In 2020, the Danish Ministry of Immigration noted in a report that: ""There is not a high criminal rate in Pankisi. The region is very calm."" Locals often joke that the police have nothing to do all day but drink tea. How to get there: Daily minibuses depart from Tbilisi's Ortachala Station for Pankisi. When to go: From May to October to avoid the cold winter months. Some guesthouses close from December to March. Where to stay: Pankisi Valley has nine guesthouses, located in the villages of Duisi and Jokolo. They are run by local families who will introduce you to Kist hospitality and provide wonderful home-cooked food. What to do: Take a guided tour of Pankisi's villages to learn more about local culture. Climb up to the old watchtower for sweeping views over the valley. Attend the dhikr ceremony, held every Friday at noon in the old mosque of Duisi village. Go hiking in the Batsara Nature Reserve. ""When I started university in Tbilisi, my classmates still had these stereotypes about Pankisi being unsafe,"" says Fatima, who works as a tourist guide when she's back home in Duisi. ""I had to explain to them that that time is long gone. This is a very peaceful place. That's what I love about it."" As part of a cultural walking tour of Duisi and Jokolo villages, Fatima leads me up a steep trail to a crumbling old watchtower with sweeping views. Around 3km wide, the vivid green valley contains a string of villages along a river. Cows wait at the front gates of intricately carved wooden houses with rows of windows on the upper floors that let in the gentle spring sunshine. Around the villages, sheep-dotted fields climb into forest-covered hills. To the north, I see the snow-capped peaks of the Caucasus Mountains. Out of sight, to the south, are the sun-drenched vineyards of Kakheti, Georgia's biggest wine-producing region. ""People here love the outdoors. In summer, we take picnics up the mountain or go horse riding in the hills,"" Fatima says. ""I don't think I could ever live in the city, coming from a place like this."" I could understand why. Pankisi Valley feels idyllic. After the last village, the road simply stops; the end of Georgia marked by a wall of mountains. I feel like I'm at the edge of the world, wrapped in a cosy coat of green hills and blue skies. The friendliness of locals adds to this feeling of comfort. Children run up and ask, in perfect English, where I am from, and show me tricks on their bikes. Adults give me cups of herbal tea and gesture directions at me whenever they think I might be lost. ""A lot of people who visit Georgia want to experience the country's legendary hospitality. Pankisi is one of the places where you can still find that,"" says Emily Lush, the creator of Wander-Lush, a travel resource for Georgia. ""In terms of the culture, the traditions, the cuisine – there is nowhere else like it."" As Sufi Muslims, the Kist population has different traditions from Georgia's mainly Orthodox population. Spiritual music and rituals are an integral part of everyday life, and the food and language of the valley are also distinct, brought across the mountains by Chechen migrants who settled in the valley in the early 19th Century. And yet, despite the valley's unique culture, it hasn't been easy to attract tourists here. This isn't due to remoteness. Pankisi Valley is just a two-and-a-half-hour drive north-east of Tbilisi and less than 20km from the town of Akhmeta, which attracts many tourists due to its winemaking. Nazy Kurashvili was the first to encourage travellers to make it those extra few kilometres to Pankisi Valley. She opened the area's first guesthouse, Nazy's Guesthouse, in 2013. She then spent years convincing the Georgian Tourism Ministry to include information about Pankisi Valley on their website, and invited foreign ambassadors to the guesthouse to show them the area. In 2018, she set up the Pankisi Valley Tourism and Development Association to help others start tourism businesses. Little by little, word got out about this picturesque valley. Pankisi was featured in Lonely Planet's 2020 Georgia, Armenia & Azerbaijan guidebook, and tour companies such as Intrepid Travel began including it in their itineraries. More like this: • Georgia's daring, death-defying pilgrimage • A 210km drive through 'the most beautiful place on Earth' • Four countries that are actively welcoming travellers Today, hundreds of tourists visit Pankisi each year – and there is plenty waiting for them when they arrive. Visitors can join horse treks or hikes into the mountain and visit heritage houses, historic churches and mosques. They can take cooking classes in Kist cuisine or join felt-making workshops. The village of Duisi has a small ethnographic museum and hosts the weekly Sufi dhikr ceremony. The nearby Batsara Nature Reserve is home to one of the world's largest and oldest yew forests, where rangers can organise hikes and birdwatching excursions. ""Tourism has played an important role in breaking down the negative stereotypes that surround the valley,"" says Lush. ""Most importantly, tourism has given people a chance to speak for themselves."" One woman who has seized the growing opportunities in the valley is Khatuna Margoshvili, who spent several years working abroad to save enough money to open a guesthouse back home. ""I love hosting people,"" she tells me. ""Some just stay in the garden. Others want to explore. And lots of them want to learn how to cook."" Kist cuisine, like its culture, is a mix of Chechen and Georgian influences, with ingredients drawn straight from the valley: homegrown vegetables, local cheeses and honey. The most popular dish is zhizhig galnash, a pasta-like dough served with melt-in-the-mouth lamb and ground garlic. Another favourite is khinkali, traditional Georgian dumplings, except here they are stuffed with nettles rather than meat. Back at Nazy's Guesthouse, the table is laden every night with Kist dishes as well as jugs of locally brewed alcohol-free beer made from rosehip. Dinner is a communal affair. Guests sit around a long table and share stories from the day's adventures: hikes through ancient forests, horse treks up past the snow line, cultural tours or cooking lessons. Many guests extend their stays to have one more night tucked away in the valley. Just a little bit longer to relax, ride a horse, fold a dumpling or pour another glass of rosehip beer. -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.  For more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.  Copyright 2025 BBC.

6/9/2025,Article,Travel,Eight rare juices you can only try in the Amazon,https://www.bbc.com//travel/article/20250529-eight-rare-juices-you-can-only-try-in-the-amazon,"Far from smoothie bars and powdered sachets, these wild Amazonian juices are pulped just hours after picking – making them rich in flavour and cultural meaning. The Amazon is not only the world's largest and most biodiverse ecosystem – it's also one of the most delicious. Among the thousands of native species, around 220 trees are known to bear edible fruit, many of which never leave the jungle. Some are too delicate to export, while others are little known beyond the communities that have nurtured them for generations. But along the Amazon River and its tributaries – from Peru's misty highland jungle to the floodplains of northern Brazil – travellers can find market stalls and cafe counters brimming with thick, vibrant juices that capture the flavour of the forest. These are the fruits you're unlikely to find bottled or powdered at home, often pulped just hours after harvest, served chilled in the tropical heat and prized not only for their nutrients but for their rich textures and sharp tangs. Here are eight juices worth seeking out, whether for their bold flavours, cultural significance or the thrill of trying something new. On the eastern slopes of the Andes, where rivers cascade in dramatic waterfalls into the Amazon Basin, travellers will find the aguaje fruit of the Moriche palm. In the small Peruvian city of Tingo Maria, markets are piled high with silver trays of the armadillo-like fruit. Locals soak them in water for a day or two, before peeling the brown armour to reveal an intensely orange flesh. The pulp is soaked, mashed and transformed into aguajina – a thick and custardy drink that tastes like cross between pumpkin pie and flan. BBC.com's World's Table ""smashes the kitchen ceiling"" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future. Some locals say that the fruit contains oestrogen compounds and men should be careful of drinking too much of it, though there is little scientific evidence. ""The aguajina is very useful – for the bone, for the skin, for the complexion – especially for women,"" says Gianina Pujay, an aguajinera who sells the drink across from Tingo Maria's fruit market. In the same region, the cocona fruit, a tropical relative of the common tomato, yields a tangy juice that tastes like a pineapple-papaya hybrid with a thick, almost oily body.  ""Many Amazonian fruits are consumed in juice form because their pulp is acidic, fibrous or difficult to eat raw, like the cocona,"" explains Miluska Carrasco, a researcher and nutritionist at Peru's Instituto de Investigación Nutricional, ""It's also a practical way to use them quickly before they spoil."" Descending from the verdant slopes of the Andes into the Amazon Basin, the rivers slow down and transform into thoroughfares of commercial activity. On the banks of the Ucayali River is the river port city of Pucallpa, the furthest Peru's road system will take you into the centre of the Amazon. Here, where container barges, passenger ships and canoes all move goods around the forest, camu camu is a must-drink juice.  The small, tart, plum-like fruit tastes like a sour strawberry with a hint of peach, and is a favourite of local juice vendors. ""[It] has more vitamin C than oranges,"" says Carrasco, ""[as well as] other bioactive compounds."" Where a navel orange provides about 6mg of vitamin C per 100g, the camu camu contains more than 2,000mg for the same amount of flesh.  The season for camu camu is short, however, typically between January and March, so take advantage of the fresh juice when it's available. Locals also eat the little plums with salt; just spit out the seeds.  In the heart of Brazil's vast Amazonas state, 700 miles east of Pucallpa as the toucan flies (and at least a week or more on a river boat), tucumã palms provide an orange fruit that's only in season from February to August. During this time, it's often eaten for breakfast with cassava flour and is a key ingredient in the state's signature x-caboquinho sandwich, where slices are layered with salty coalho cheese and sweet chunks of fried plantains. To make juice from the notoriously fibrous tucumã, vendors use peelers, blenders and sieves to reduce shavings of the fruit to a pulp and then filter out the lightly nutty liquid. According to Francisco Falcão, a farmer in the community of Bom Jesus in the Tefé National Forest, ""people say that tucumã is good to eat and improves sight and skin"". Indeed, the fruit is rich in both manganese and calcium. Where kiwi, which is relatively high in calcium, contains around 30mg of calcium per 100g, tucumã has been measured to contain around four times as much. Also in the Tefé region, ""there's a palm tree that people eat the fruit of,"" says Falcão. ""Pupunha is a plant that we harvest starting in December and ending February."" Spanish-speaking parts of the Amazon know this oily palm fruit as pejibaye or pijuayo, and it is a key source of natural fats as well as vitamin B1 and vitamin E.   The pupunha grow in clusters of orange and red acorn-shaped fruit. They cannot be eaten raw, but once boiled they make a filling snack akin to an oily sweet potato. The boiled fruits also produce a creamy orange juice once fully pulped. In Peru, forest communities ferment the pulp into a lightly alcoholic drink called chicha or masato – especially during times of harvest.    In Manaus, capital of the Amazonas, reliable refrigeration means locals and visitors can enjoy fruits in various forms. The thick shell of the cupuaçu contains a collection of seeds surrounded by a fleshy white pulp. That pulp can be transformed into silky, tangy juice. But lately, locals have been incorporating its juice into ice cream. Indeed, the rest of Brazil is catching on, with ice cream parlours in Rio de Janeiro now offering the flavour too. More like this: • Spain's 'white gold' super-drink • A decadent avocado smoothie to break the Ramadan fast • The Caribbean's cooling, healthy elixir for summer Cupuaçu tastes like a creamy pineapple – surprising given that it's a close relative of cacao. ""It's the same genus as cacao and people make cupulate [as opposed to chocolate from it],"" says Daniel Tregidgo, a researcher at Brazil's Mamirauá Institute for Sustainable Development. ""When you go to the markets there are huge piles of cupuaçu seeds. I look at that and I say that's hipster chocolate right there."" Why haven’t we heard of cupulate yet? In Tregidgo's opinion, ""It's a matter of investment. If you take something from the middle of Amazon and you try to get it out into the global market without being exploitative, it is a bit tricky."" Bars produced from cupuaçu have the flavour of chocolate but retain some of their citrus piquancy. In the Amazon delta, jenipapo is known for its traditional use as a blue dye and a temporary tattoo ink. The fruit itself, which grows all along Brazil's coast in addition to the Amazon, has a yellowish pulp that's a great source of vitamin B1 and zinc. While jenipapo can be consumed as a fresh juice that tastes a bit like dried apricots, try ordering licor de jenipapo, an infused cachaça liqueur served in small bars and botecos. While açaí has become a global wellness trend, the version served in the Amazon bears little resemblance to the frozen bowls found abroad. What many travellers don't realise is that there are seven distinct açaí palm species. Locals distinguish between açaí-do-Pará, açaí-do-mato and juçara, depending on region. In Belém, for example, vendors use pneumatic presses to extract the berry's thick, purplish pulp – sold in clear bags and consumed straight out of bowls with spoons, as if a purple gazpacho. Outside of its natural range in Brazil, the rest of the country enjoys the pulp prepared in yogurts and ice creams.  -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.  For more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.  Copyright 2025 BBC.

6/9/2025,Article,News,UK proposes wider ban on destructive ocean bottom trawling ,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/c3v507lx0e3o,"A ban on a ""destructive"" type of fishing that drags large nets along the seafloor could be extended across English waters, the government has said. The proposal would expand the ban on bottom trawling from 18,000km2 to 48,000km2 (around 18,500 sq miles) of the UK's offshore areas that are already designated as protected. The plan is subject to a 12-week industry consultation. A UN Ocean Conference begins in France today amid warnings from Sir David Attenborough that bottom trawling is destroying areas of the seabed and marine life. A major goal of the conference is for more countries, including the UK, to ratify a treaty to put a third of international waters into protected areas by 2030. Speaking before the summit, Sir David told Prince William he was ""appalled"" by the fishing method.  The naturalist's latest documentary Ocean With David Attenborough showed new footage of a bottom trawling net bulldozing through silt on the seafloor and scooping up species indiscriminately. Last week, MPs on the Environmental Audit Committee renewed calls to ban bottom trawling, dredging and mining for aggregates on the seabed in what are known as Marine Protected Areas (MPAs).  The extension proposed by the government would cover 41 of England's 181 MPAs, and would protect rare marine animals and the delicate seabed they rely upon.   It says it has carried out detailed assessments into the harms caused to habitats and species. Environment Secretary Steve Reed said ""without urgent action our oceans will be irreversibly destroyed"". The BBC has reached out to the UK's National Federation of Fishermen's Organisations for comment. Some fishing communities have pushed back on the assertion that bottom trawling needs to be banned in all MPAs. They say that it isn't destructive unless done in the wrong place, and that it's an efficient way to produce food.  A 12-week consultation will run until 1 September and will seek the views of the marine and fishing industry.  Ariana Densham, head of oceans at Greenpeace UK, said the consultation was ""ultimately a long-overdue completion of a process started by the previous government"". The Wildlife Trust said it hoped the extended ban would be put in place ""rapidly"".   It would be a ""win-win for both nature and the climate,"" added the trust's director of policy and public affairs, Joan Edwards.  Pressure is also building for more countries to ratify the High Seas Treaty at the Ocean Conference in Nice.  The treaty was agreed by 193 countries two years ago to put 30% of international waters into protected areas.  The treaty will not come into force until it is ratified by 60 countries. It was announced at the opening of the conference that an additional 15 countries had ratified the treaty on Monday, but that only brings the figure to 47. The UK is among those countries that has yet to ratify. President Macron, whose country is co-hosting the conference with Costa Rica, shared the news with governments in attendance at the conference - it was met with cheers from the room. He and his counterpart President Rodrigo Chaves both also spoke of their concern about deep sea mining, and called for a moratorium. ""The ocean is not for sale. We're talking about a common shared good,"" President Macron said.""I think it's madness to launch predatory economic action that will disrupt the deep seabed, disrupt biodiversity, destroy it."" He was speaking in reference to the decision made by President Trump in April to begin issuing permits to drill in the deep sea - in the hope that critical minerals could be retrieved. This goes against a decade-long international negotiation to get global agreement on how any resources from the deep sea could be shared. China called the move, at the time, was a ""violation"" of international law. More than 2,000 marine scientists have recommended that deep sea exploration is temporarily stopped until there is further research to understand the potential impacts on ecosystems.
