2025-06-05,Article,Trump and Musk enter bitter feud - and Washington buckles up,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/c3wd2215q08o,"What happens when the richest person and the most powerful politician have a knock-down, drag-out fight? The world may be about to find out. A disagreement between Elon Musk and Donald Trump started at a simmer last week, began bubbling on Wednesday and is now in full-on boil. And like everything these two men do, it is all spilling out into public view. These two men have two of the world's biggest megaphones, and they clearly enjoy using them. In remarks at the Oval Office on Thursday afternoon, Trump sounded a bit like a spurned lover. He expressed surprise at Musk's criticism of his ""big, beautiful"" tax and spending legislation. He pushed back against the notion that he would have lost last year's presidential election without Musk's hundreds of millions of dollars in support. And he said Musk was only changing his tune now because his car company, Tesla, will be hurt by the Republican push to end electric vehicle tax credits. Musk took to his social media site, X, with a very Generation X response for his 220 million followers: ""Whatever"". He said he didn't care about the car subsidies, he wanted to shrink the national debt, which he says is an existential threat to the nation. He called Trump ""ungrateful"" for his help last year and insisted that Democrats would have prevailed without him. Musk and Trump had formed a powerful but unlikely alliance , culminating in the tech billionaire having a key position of budget-slashing authority in the Trump administration. Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, or Doge, became one of the biggest stories of Trump's first 100 days, as it shuttered entire agencies and dismissed thousands of government workers. It wasn't long, however, before speculation began over when – and how - the two outsized personalities would ultimately fall out. For a while, it seemed like those predictions were off the mark. Trump stood by Musk even as the latter's popularity dropped, as he feuded with administration officials and as he became a liability in several key elections earlier this year. Every time it appeared there would be a break, Musk would pop up in the Oval Office, or the Cabinet room or on the president's Air Force One flight to Mar-a-Lago. When Musk's 130 days as a ""special government employee"" ended last week, the two had a chummy Oval Office send-off, with a golden key to the White House and hints that Musk might someday return. It's safe to say that any invitation has been rescinded and the locks have been changed. ""Elon and I had a great relationship,"" Trump said on Thursday – a comment notable for its use of the past tense. There had been some thought that Trump's surprise announcement on Wednesday night of a new travel ban, additional sanctions on Harvard and a conspiracy-laced administration investigation of former President Joe Biden were all efforts to change the subject from Musk's criticism. The White House and its allies in Congress seemed careful not to further antagonise him after his earlier comments. Then Trump spoke out and … so much for that. Now the question is where the dispute goes next. Congressional Republicans could find it harder to keep their members behind Trump's bill with Musk providing rhetorical – and, perhaps financial – air for those who break ranks.  Trump, who takes pride in being a devastating counterpuncher, will have plenty of opportunity to lay into Musk. What will happen to Musk's Doge allies still in the Trump administration or government contracts to Musk-related companies or Biden-era investigations into Musk's business dealings? ""The easiest way to save money in our budget, billions and billions of dollars, is to terminate Elon's governmental subsidies and contracts,"" Trump posted menacingly on his own social media website. If Trump turns the machinery of government against Musk, the tech billionaire will feel pain. Tesla's stock price slipped on Thursday.  But Musk also has near limitless resources to respond, including by funding insurgent challengers to Republicans in next year's elections and primaries. He may not win a fight against the whole of Trump's government, but he could exact a high political price. Meanwhile, Democrats are on the sidelines, wondering how to respond. Few seem willing to welcome Musk, a former donor to their party, back into the fold. But there's also the old adage that the enemy of an enemy is a friend. ""It's a zero-sum game,"" Liam Kerr, a Democratic strategist, told Politico. ""Anything that he does that moves more toward Democrats hurts Republicans."" At the very least, Democrats seem happy to stand back and let the two men exchange blows. And until they abandon this fight, the din is likely to drown out everything else in American politics. But don't expect this spat to end anytime soon. ""Trump has 3.5 years left as president,"" Musk wrote on X, ""but I will be around for 40-plus years."" Copyright 2025 BBC.

2025-06-05,Article,"Trump's new ban dodges pitfalls faced by last attempt, experts say",https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/cd7gp8l1241o,"US President Donald Trump has issued a sweeping new travel ban for people from 12 countries, revisiting a hallmark policy of his first term in office. There are some key differences, however. The original travel ban suffered a series of legal defeats. This time, the policy appears to have been designed to avoid the same pitfalls. Its predecessor, which targeted seven predominantly Muslim countries and was dubbed the ""Muslim ban"" by critics, was ordered just a week after Trump took office in 2017, during his first term in the White House. The ban was amended twice to overcome court challenges, after opponents argued it was unconstitutional and illegal because it discriminated against travellers based on their religion. A scaled-back version was eventually upheld by the US Supreme Court in 2018, which this new ban closely resembles. Legal experts told the BBC that it appeared Trump had learned lessons from his first attempt. Christi Jackson, an expert in US immigration law at the London firm Laura Devine Immigration, said the new ban was more legally robust as a result. While the first lacked ""clarity"", the new restrictions were ""wider in scope"" and had ""clearly defined"" exemptions, she said. While there are some similarities in the nations chosen by the 2017 ban and the 2025 ban, Muslim-majority states are not the express target of the latest order. Barbara McQuade, professor of law at the University of Michigan and former US attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan, told the BBC World Service's Newshour programme that, on this basis, it seemed likely to win the approval of the Supreme Court if it was ever referred up to that level. The 12 countries subject to the harshest restrictions from 9 June are mainly in the Middle East, Africa and the Caribbean, including Afghanistan, Iran and Somalia. There will be partial restrictions on travellers from another seven countries, including Cuban and Venezuelan nationals. Trump said the strength of the restrictions would be graded against the severity of the perceived threat, including from terrorism. But besides Iran, none of the 12 countries hit by the outright ban are named on the US government's state sponsors of terrorism list. Trump cited Sunday's incident in Boulder, Colorado, in which a man was accused of throwing Molotov cocktails at demonstrators attending a march for Israeli hostages, in a video announcing the ban on X. The alleged attacker was an Egyptian national. However, Egypt does not appear on either list.  Trump also specified high rates of people overstaying their visas as a reason for listing certain countries. However, Steven D Heller, an immigration lawyer based in the US, said there was a ""lack of clarity"" over what threshold had to be met by a country's overstaying rate in order for that country to be placed on Trump's ban list. That could be the basis for a successful legal challenge, he suggested. ""If they're relying on this notion of excessive overstay rates... they have to define what that actually means,"" he told the BBC. But he noted that existing US law gave the president broad powers over immigration policy. Unlike the first ban, which was to last for only 90 to 120 days, today's order has no end date. It has been met with dismay in the targeted countries.  Venezuela has described the Trump administration as ""supremacists who think they own the world"", though Somalia has pledged to ""engage in dialogue to address the concerns raised"". The original ban spurred mass protests and sowed chaos at US airports.  It was repealed in 2021 by Trump's successor, President Joe Biden, who called the policy ""a stain on our national conscience"". Immigration lawyer Shabnam Lotfi, who challenged the previous travel ban, said it would be an ""uphill battle"" to overturn the new one.  ""The president does have the authority to determine who is admissible to the US,"" she said, adding that because of the way the ban had been written, it was ""harder to find a huge group of people that could file a class-action lawsuit"". ""They've put more thought into it."" Ms Lotfi noted that the new restrictions could have consequences for students and other visa applicants abroad. ""Students who are stuck in administrative processing are impacted. So are winners of the diversity visa lottery who paid fees and went to interviews - they're unlikely to get visas now,"" she said. ""Even EB-5 investors - people who've put over $1 million into the US economy - are affected. And H-1B visa holders stuck abroad, waiting to return to their US employers, could also be blocked.""

2025-06-05,Article,Supreme Court rules for heterosexual woman in discrimination case,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/cr7zlr1rdpdo,"The US Supreme Court has sided with an Ohio woman who alleged she was discriminated against at her job because she was heterosexual. The justices voted unanimously in a ruling focused on evidence standards that could make it easier to file similar ""reverse discrimination"" cases.  Marlean Ames said that despite working for the Ohio Department of Youth Services for more than 20 years, she was denied a promotion and then demoted. She had appealed to the court to challenge the standards required to prove her case. The decision effectively lowers the burden of proof required for people who are members of a majority group - such as white or heterosexual people - to make discrimination claims. US court precedent covering some states, including Ohio, had required that members of majority groups show additional ""background circumstances"" to prove their case or evidence showing a pattern of discrimination.  The court has now ruled that the standard of evidence for a discrimination claim should be the same, regardless of a person's identity. Justice Kentaji Brown Jackson, one of the court's liberals, wrote the official opinion, with concurring opinions from conservatives Justice Clarence Thomas and Justice Neil Gorsuch.  The court concluded that anti-discrimination and equal protection laws were meant to apply to all Americans. ""By establishing the same protections for every 'individual'—without regard to that individual's membership in a minority or majority group—Congress left no room for courts to impose special requirements on majority-group plaintiffs alone,"" she wrote. The court did not consider Ms Ames' original discrimination suit. The justices said it was up to lower courts that had initially ruled against her to evaluate the case under the clarified evidence standards.  Legal experts say employment discrimination and bias cases can be difficult to demonstrate, regardless of the burden of proof. Ms Ames had said she had positive performance reviews, but a promotion she sought was given to a lesbian. She was then demoted and her job was given to a gay man.  In a lawsuit, she argued her employer had a preference for LGBTQ staff members and denied her opportunities because she identifies as straight. Lower courts ruled that she had failed to provide sufficient evidence of her claim, propelling the burden of proof question to the Supreme Court.  At a February hearing, justices on both sides ideologically appeared sympathetic to her argument. Copyright 2025 BBC.

2025-06-05,Article,Why are these 12 countries on Trump's travel-ban list?,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/cz6329yvwdvo,"A travel ban issued on Wednesday by US President Donald Trump is set to primarily affect countries in Africa and the Middle East.  Twelve countries face full bans, which will come into force on Monday. People from a further seven nations are facing partial restrictions.  Trump has depicted it as a matter of national security. He cited a recent attack on members of Colorado's Jewish community, which was allegedly carried out by an Egyptian national. Egypt itself is not on the banned list. Other reasons cited include alleged breaking of US visa rules by people from the countries in question. Here is a closer look at some of the president's reasoning. A range of accusations have been made against Afghanistan in a presidential proclamation signed by Trump. The document highlights that the Taliban, which controls the country, is a Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT) group.  The move comes just weeks after the Trump administration appeared to signal that it believed the situation had improved in Afghanistan, when it announced the end of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Afghans living in the US. Afghanistan is further accused by Trump of lacking a ""competent or co-operative"" central authority for issuing passports or civil documents. As with other countries on Trump's list, the issue of Afghan nationals overstaying their visas is also cited. Trump's proclamation identifies Iran as a state sponsor of terrorism - a longstanding charge that the Middle Eastern nation has previously rejected.  The US has previously censured Tehran, Iran's capital, for its alleged sponsorship of proxy groups operating in the region, such as Hamas and Hezbollah. The new proclamation from Trump says the country is ""the source of significant terrorism around the world"", does not co-operate with the US on security risks and has ""historically failed to accept back its removable nationals"". The move comes amid diplomatic wrangling between the two sides over the creation of a new deal over Iran's nuclear weapon-building capabilities. Similar reasons are given in the case of Somalia. The east African country is branded by Trump as a ""terrorist safe haven"".  Like Iran, it is also accused of failing to accept its nationals when removed from the US. However, a further point was made by Trump: ""Somalia stands apart from other countries in the degree to which its government lacks command and control of its territory, which greatly limits the effectiveness of its national capabilities in a variety of respects."" Somalia's internationally-based government faces a significant challenge from armed Islamists. It has pledged to ""engage in dialogue to address the concerns raised"" by Trump. Libya, in north Africa, is cited for its ""historical terrorist presence"", which is painted as a security threat to Americans. Libya and Somalia are also among the countries on Trump's list which have been criticised for their perceived incompetence at issuing passports. The document highlights that ""hundreds of thousands of illegal Haitian aliens flooded into the United States during the Biden Administration"".  Trump points to various perceived risks that this has entailed - including the creation of ""criminal networks"" and high visa overstay rates. Data from the US Census Bureau suggested more than 852,000 Haitians were living in the US in February 2024, though it does not give a breakdown of when those migrants arrived.  Many came after a devastating earthquake in 2010, or after fleeing gang violence that took hold in the Caribbean nation. The US president also points to a lack of central authority in Haiti for matters including law enforcement.  These countries are solely accused by Trump of having relatively high visa overstay rates.  The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) defines an ""overstay"" as a person who remains in the US beyond their authorised period of admission, with no evidence of any extension. The ""rate"" signals the proportion of people who overstayed. The central African nation Chad is singled out for showing a ""a blatant disregard for United States immigration laws"".  The document highlights an overstay rate of 49.54% by Chadians on business or tourist visas in 2023, citing a DHS report. Congo-Brazzaville and Equatorial Guinea have equivalent rates of 29.63% and 21.98% respectively. But these rates are lower than Laos, which faces a lesser restriction.  Myanmar - referred to as Burma in the Trump proclamation - is similarly accused of a high visa overstay rates.  As with others on the list, including Iran, the country is further accused of not co-operating with the US to accept deported Burmese nationals. For each of these countries, the first allegation made by Trump is that they have questionable competence at issuing passports and civil documents.  Eritrea and Sudan are further accused of having relatively high visa overstay rates. Eritrea is also blamed for failing to make the criminal records of its national available to the US, and of refusing to accept deported nationals. As with Somalia, Yemen is also accused of lacking control over its own land. Trump's proclamation highlights that it is the site of active US military operations. The US has been combating Houthis, who have seized much of the north and west of the country during an ongoing civil war.

2025-06-05,Article,Chad halts US visas in revenge for Trump travel ban,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/cyvm2j32pvmo,"The central African nation of Chad says it is suspending all visas to US citizens as a matter of ""reciprocity"", after learning that it is one of a dozen countries whose nationals are banned from travelling to the US. ""Chad has neither planes to offer nor billions of dollars to give, but Chad has its dignity and pride,"" continued President Mahamat Idriss Déby Itno in a Facebook post (in French) on Thursday. Africa is the continent worst affected by the travel ban announced by US President Donald Trump, with seven of the 12 countries on the list. It is set to come into effect on Monday. The order prohibits people from Chad, Congo-Brazzaville, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Libya, Somalia and Sudan - as well as Afghanistan, Myanmar, Haiti, Iran and Yemen - from entering the US. In addition, there will be travel restrictions on nationals of Burundi, Sierra Leone, Togo, Cuba, Laos, Turkmenistan and Venezuela - they will no longer be able to travel to the US on certain visas. ""We will not allow people to enter our country who wish to do us harm,"" Trump said in a video posted on X.  The US president said the list could be revised if ""material improvements"" were made and additional countries could be added as ""threats emerge around the world"". The White House said these ""common-sense restrictions"" would ""protect Americans from dangerous foreign actors"". Somalia was quick to react to the travel ban, immediately pledging to work with the US to address any security issues. In a statement, Somali ambassador to the US, Dahir Hassan Abdi, said his country ""values its longstanding relationship"" with America. Chad did not disguise its dismay, and in addition to the president's stern words, its Foreign Minister Abdoulaye Sabre Fadoul told the AFP news agency his government was ""surprised by this announcement and even more by the terrorism-related reason [which] completely disregards Chad's commitment and results in this area"". The African Union said it was ""concerned about the potential negative impact"" of the measures and called on the US to adopt ""a more consultative approach... with the countries concerned."" BBC Tigrinya has spoken to several Eritreans who are alarmed by the ban. ""As Eritreans, we've already suffered under our regime at home and now we're facing the same hardship under Trump's immigration policies. We've endured so much pain,"" one man told the BBC on condition of anonymity.  Eritrea is a one-party state where President Isaias Afwerki has been in power since it won independence from Ethiopia in 1993 after a bitter 30-year struggle. Young Eritreans are subject to compulsory military service, prompting many thousands to flee the country and seek refuge elsewhere. Another Eritrean woman said she worried that she and her children would no longer be able to join her husband who is already living in the US. ""We've waited so long and done everything legally, but now we're left in limbo. No-one is giving us clear answers,"" she told the BBC. In a video posted to his Truth Social website, Trump said the recent alleged terror attack in Boulder, Colorado ""underscored the extreme dangers"" posed by foreign nationals who had not been ""properly vetted"". However, the suspect in that attack is an Egyptian national and Egypt is not one of the affected countries. According to the White House explanation of the travel ban, countries such as Libya, Somalia and Sudan lack competent authorities to issue passports or civil documents and conduct ""appropriate screening measures"". All three are currently embroiled in civil wars. In addition, the White House said: ""A persistent terrorist threat also emanates from Somalia's territory"" and there was a ""historical terrorist presence within Libya's territory"". The other African countries affected had high rates of people overstaying their visas, ranging from 15% in Togo to 70% for some types of visa for nationals of Equatorial Guinea.  The ban takes effect on 9 June, a cushion that avoids the chaos that unfolded at airports nationwide when a similar measure took effect with virtually no notice eight years ago. Visas issued before that date will not be revoked, the order said. There will be exemptions for dual nationals and athletes in major sporting events such as the 2026 men's football World Cup and the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. The travel ban fulfils a promise Trump made during his 2024 election campaign but is likely to be challenged in court.  He signed a similar order in 2017, during his first term in office. It featured some of the same countries as his latest order, including Libya, Somalia and Iran. Critics called that a ""Muslim ban"" as the seven countries initially listed were Muslim majority. The White House revised the policy, ultimately adding two non-Muslim majority countries, North Korea and Venezuela. This was upheld by the Supreme Court in 2018. President Joe Biden, who succeeded Trump, repealed the ban in 2021, calling it ""a stain on our national conscience"".

2025-06-05,Article,What we know about Trump's latest travel ban,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/cx271g270v7o,"Donald Trump has signed a ban on travel to the US from 12 countries, citing national security risks. There are also seven additional countries whose nationals will face partial travel restrictions. The US president said the list could be revised if ""material improvements"" were made, while other countries could be added as ""threats emerge around the world"".  It is the second time he has ordered a ban on travel from certain countries. He signed a similar order in 2017 during his first term in office. Trump has signed a proclamation banning travel to the US from nationals of 12 countries: Nationals from these countries will not be allowed to enter the US unless they qualify for an exemption.  There are an additional seven countries whose nationals face partial travel restrictions:  Those under the partial restrictions will not be able to travel to the US with certain visas. The ban takes effect on Monday at 00:01 EDT (04:01 GMT), a cushion that avoids the chaos that unfolded at US airports when a similar measure took effect with virtually no notice eight years ago.  No end date has been provided. The order calls for periodic review. The White House said these ""common sense restrictions"" would ""protect Americans from dangerous foreign actors"". In a video posted to his Truth Social website, Trump said the recent alleged terror attack in Boulder, Colorado ""underscored the extreme dangers"" posed by foreign nationals who had not been ""properly vetted"". Twelve people were injured in Colorado on Sunday when a man attacked a group gathering in support of Israeli hostages, throwing two incendiary devices and using a makeshift flamethrower. The man accused of carrying out the attack has been identified as an Egyptian national, but Egypt is not included on the list of banned countries. Trump has close ties with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who has in the past been described by the US president as his ""favourite dictator"". Only two of the 19 countries are on the US government's State Sponsors of Terrorism list - Iran, which has a full ban, and Cuba, which faces partial travel restrictions. But national security is given as a partial reason for the choices. In the proclamation, Trump said many of the countries listed have a ""historic failure to accept back their removable nationals"" from the US, as well as having ""taken advantage"" of the US by exploiting its visa system. He added that nationals from certain countries also ""pose significant risks"" of overstaying their visas. There are a number of people from affected countries who may still be able to enter the US due to a number of exceptions. The order does not apply to:  In addition, the US Secretary of State may grant exemptions to individuals on a ""case-by-case"" basis, if ""the individual would serve a United States national interest"". Trump's latest order, which is expected to face legal challenges, drew a swift response, at home and abroad.  Chad has retaliated by suspending all visas to US citizens, with President Mahamat Idriss Déby Itno saying the country ""has its dignity and pride"". Somalia promised to work with the US to address any security issues, with ambassador to the US, Dahir Hassan Abdi, saying his country ""values its longstanding relationship"" with the US.  Venezuela's Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello warned that ""being in the United States is a great risk for anyone, not just for Venezuelans"". The African Union, which represents all 55 countries on the continent, called on the US to ""engage in constructive dialogue with the countries concerned"".   It appealed to the US to exercise its right to protect its borders and its citizens' security ""in a manner that is balanced, evidence-based, and reflective of the long-standing partnership between the United States and Africa"". The union said it remained concerned about the ""potential negative impact of such measures"". The UN's human rights chief, Volker Turk, said the ban ""raises concerns from the perspective of international law"" ""The broad and sweeping nature of the new travel ban raises concerns from the perspective of international law,"" Volker Turk said in a statement. That included ""the principle of non-discrimination and of the necessity and proportionality of the measures deployed to meet the security concerns stated"", he told news agency AFP. In the US, Democrats were quick to condemn the move. ""This ban, expanded from Trump's Muslim ban in his first term, will only further isolate us on the world stage,"" Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal wrote on social media. Congressman Don Beyer said Trump had ""betrayed"" the ideals of the founders of the US. Human rights organisation Amnesty International USA described it as ""discriminatory, racist, and downright cruel"", while the US-based Human Rights First called it ""yet another anti-immigrant and punitive action taken"" by the president. But others support the ban. Congressman Clay Higgins of Louisiana said travel to the US was ""a privilege, not a right"".  He claimed on BBC Radio's Today programme that Americans had ""had enough of immigrants coming to our country, violating our laws and committing violence among our people"". Greg Swenson, chairman of Republicans Overseas UK, said the list of countries subject to the travel ban proves the White House is using a ""common sense policy"", but expressed suprise that Egypt had not been included. ""I think what the president has decided was that Egypt, despite having one particular incident from an illegal migrant, might have some policies that are in place which are better than other countries,"" he said. Trump's original ban took place in 2017, during his first White House term, and featured some of the same countries as his latest order, including Iran, Libya and Somalia.   Critics called it a ""Muslim ban"" as the seven countries initially listed were Muslim majority, and it was immediately challenged in courts across the US. The White House revised the policy, ultimately adding two non-Muslim majority countries, North Korea and Venezuela. It was upheld by the US Supreme Court in 2018. Joe Biden, who succeeded Trump as US president, repealed the ban in 2021, calling it ""a stain on our national conscience"". US immigration law expert Christi Jackson said the new ban suggested ""lessons have been learned"" from Trump's first attempt. The latest ban was not being implemented immediately, the restrictions were ""wider in scope"" and it had ""clearly defined"" exemptions, she told the BBC. Professor of law and former US attorney Barbara McQuade said the last travel ban had ""caused chaos at the border"", while this time Trump had given some advance notice. ""The first time around it included lawful permanent residents or Green Card holders, people who had established status in the United States, which courts found to be a violation of the Constitution,"" she told BBC Newshour. ""This time I think there has been more thought given to this,"" she said, adding it was ""very likely"" to be upheld by the Supreme Court.

2025-06-05,Article,Women warned weight-loss jabs may affect the pill,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/cn0gp2pl7zwo,"Women using weight-loss jabs have been warned by the UK's medicines regulator that they must use effective contraception. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) says it is not known whether taking the medicines, such as Wegovy and Mounjaro, could harm an unborn baby. It also warns that weight-loss jabs may make the contraceptive pill less likely to work in those who are overweight or obese. There are concerns that the growing popularity of 'skinny jabs' means many women aren't using the drugs safely or getting the right advice. It's thought the contraceptive pill may not be absorbed properly due to common side-effects of the jabs such as vomiting and diarrhoea, and because they slow the emptying of the stomach.  The MHRA says women should use contraception while taking GLP-1 medicines and for a certain period afterwards before trying to become pregnant - two months for Wegovy and Ozempic, and one month for Mounjaro. It also advises that those using Mounjaro and taking an oral contraceptive should also use a condom for four weeks after starting the drug, or switch to another method such as the coil or implant.  Advice on contraception already appears in patient information leaflets that come with the medicines, but the MHRA has now issued its own guidance. The drugs safety body says weight-loss injections must not be taken: Women should be told this information when they starting taking the jabs, but there are fears the message is not getting through. Natasha Major, 26, started using Mounjaro to lose weight before planning to try for her third baby in a few years' time, but was shocked six weeks later to find she was pregnant. She was taking the contraceptive pill at the time. ""I have polycystic ovaries as well, so I can't get pregnant easily or quickly. So it was an even bigger shock that I had, which didn't make any sense to me,"" she says. She then worried she could be harming the baby or it would not develop properly. Natasha rang her GP for advice and was told to stop taking it. ""We're over the initial shock now and really happy, just wasn't expected,"" she says.  ""The last injection I took, I found out about the pregnancy three hours later and haven't taken it since then. ""I've had an early scan to make sure the pregnancy was viable and okay - baby had a little heartbeat and everything looks good,"" Natasha says.  The MHRA, as well as doctors and pharmacists, are worried that popular GLP-1 medicines, known as Wegovy, Mounjaro, Saxenda, Victoza and Ozempic, are not being used safely. These prescription medicines, which are licensed to treat obesity (and Ozempic for type 2 diabetes), make people feel full by mimicking a hormone released after eating. Mounjaro also acts on another hormone linked to appetite and blood sugar control. They are only available on the NHS to people with a very high BMI, but can also be bought privately from high street and online chemists. Such is the demand for the jabs, they are also being sold illegally on social media and from beauty salons, without any medical advice or prescription, as a quick fix to lose weight.  The MHRA advises people to have a conversation with their prescriber about the risks and benefits of taking them, and understand the potential side-effects by talking to a doctor or pharmacist. It has acted now because it has received around 40 reports relating to pregnancy made to its Yellow Card scheme, where the public can report suspected side-effects of medicines. Some of these have been unintended pregnancies. Dr Alison Cave, chief safety officer at the MHRA, said there was evidence from animal studies ""that these medicines may harm the unborn baby"". ""But we don't know whether we have the same effects in humans, so much more data is needed to determine that."" Women of child-bearing age are usually not included in clinical trials, which is why there is a lack of safety information for them. ""If you are taking this medicine and you are pregnant, you should talk to your doctor about stopping the medicine as soon as possible,"" Dr Cave said. Sukhi Basra, vice-chairwoman of the National Pharmacy Association, said women should visit their pharmacist for advice if they are confused about when to stop using the drugs, and always buy them from an official pharmacy. Dr Bassel Wattar, pregnancy expert and consultant at Epsom and St Helier University Hospitals, said the implant or the intrauterine coil offered ""more robust contraception"" than the oral combined contraceptive pill while taking the injections. Losing a lot of weight can sometimes help some women restore natural ovulation and boost their chances of becoming pregnant, but he said this should be planned under the care of specialist doctors ""to ensure a pregnancy can be planned safely after a washout period off these drugs"". BPAS, the British Pregnancy Advisory Service, says women in the UK ""face significant challenges"" when trying to access their contraceptive method of choice. A lack of appointments, long waiting lists and high costs are just some of the barriers they face, BPAS said, as it called for a better plan for providing the choice women need.

2025-06-05,Article,How airline fees have turned baggage into billions,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/c0qg3ylx2g9o,"With Air Canada and Southwest the latest airlines to charge passengers for check-in luggage, the ballooning cost of such ancillary or ""junk fees"" is provoking anger among politicians and consumer groups. At the same time, sales of suitcases small enough for passengers to take on the plane as hand luggage are booming. Standing outside Toronto's downtown airport, Lauren Alexander has flown over from Boston for the weekend. She describes such additional charges as ""ridiculous"". ""It feels like a trick,"" says the 24-year-old. ""You buy the ticket, you think it's going to be less expensive, then you have to pay $200 (£148) extra [to bring a suitcase]."" To avoid the fee, Ms Alexander instead travelled with a small backpack as hand luggage. Sage Riley, who is 27, agrees, telling the BBC, ""It can be pricey."" There was a time when checked bags, seat selection and your meals all came as standard on commercial flights. But that all changed with the rise of the budget airlines, says Jay Sorensen of US aviation consultancy IdeaWorks. It was in 2006 when UK low-cost carrier FlyBe became what is believed to be the world's first airline to start charging passengers to check in bags. It charged £2 for a pre-booked item of luggage, and £4 if the customer hadn't paid in advance.  Other budget carriers then quickly followed suit, with the so-called flag carriers or established airlines then also doing so, at least on shorter flights. In 2008 American Airlines became the first US airline to charge a fee, $15, for the first checked bag on its domestic routes. Mr Sorenson says such traditional airlines felt they had no choice when they ""began to realise that the low-cost carriers were providing very significant competition"". He adds: ""They felt they had to do something to meet that."" Fast forward to today, and US airlines alone made $7.27bn from check-in baggage fees last year, according to federal figures. That is up from $7bn in 2023, and $5.76bn in 2019. Little wonder then that more of us are trying to just take carry-on. Kirsty Glenn, managing director of UK luggage firm Antler, confirms that there is an ongoing surge in demand for small suitcases that meet airline dimension limits for carry-on luggage. ""We have seen huge spikes in searches online and on our website,"" she says. Describing a new small-dimension case her company launched in April, Ms Glenn adds: ""Testament to the trend of only travelling with hand luggage, it's sold like crazy."" At the same time, social media content about travel packing ""hacks"" and luggage that meets airlines' carry-on size measurements, have soared according to travel journalist Chelsea Dickenson. She makes this content for TikTok. ""Social media has really propelled this idea of needing a bag that fits the baggage allowance requirements, says Ms Dickenson. ""It's become a core part of the content that I create and post on social media."" Ms Dickenson, whose social media following has ballooned to close to a million followers, adds that her luggage videos have become a ""core part of the content"" she creates. ""It blows my mind,"" she says. ""I could spend weeks and weeks researching a big trip, and the resulting videos will not come close to doing as well as me going and buying a cheap suitcase, taking it to the airport, testing it in one of those baggage sizes and reporting back."" The overall global cost of all airline extra fees, from luggage to seat selection, buying wifi access, lounge access, upgrades, and food and drink, is expected to reach $145bn this year, 14% of the sector's total revenues. That's according to the International Air Transport Association, which represents the industry. This compares with $137bn last year. These numbers have caught the attention of some politicians in Washington, and last December airline bosses were grilled before a senate committee. It was a Democrat senator who used the term ""junk fees"".   He wants the federal government to review such costs and potentially fine airlines. We asked the US Department of Transportation for a comment, but did not get a response. But if having to pay for check-in wasn't enough, a growing number of airlines are now charging for hand luggage. For example, Irish budget airline Ryanair will only allow you to carry a small bag that fits under the seat in front of you for free. If you want to take a bigger bag or suitcase to go in the overhead locker that will cost you from £6. Other European airlines that now have similar charges for hand luggage are Easyjet, Norwegian Airlines, Transavia, Volotea, Vueling, and Wizzair. This has annoyed pan-European consumer group Becu (The European Consumer Organisation), which last month filed a complaint with the European Commission. Becu cites a 2014 EU Court of Justice ruling, which said ""carriage of hand baggage cannot be made subject to a price supplement, provided that it meets reasonable requirements in terms of its weight and dimensions, and complies with applicable security requirements"". However, what determines ""reasonable requirements"" continues to be a grey area in need of an official ruling. There can, however, be a different way of doing things, as shown by Indian airline IndiGo. Its boss Pieter Eibers says that it does not charge for check-in luggage. ""The entire philosophy here is different,"" he says. ""We don't want long lines, and endless debates at gates about the weight of luggage. We don't have any of that. We turn our planes around in 35 minutes."" Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.  The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites. Read about our approach to external linking.  "
2025-06-05,Article,'I slowly realised I was running two households',https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/c5y4zzwr943o,"As retirement age rises for many people, more grown-up children than ever are providing their parents with the support they need to go on living independently, while also continuing to work full time themselves. Christine Bell is one of these so-called ""carents"". Christine is preparing to take her 95-year-old father Colin to a routine hospital appointment. But, for Christine, who lives in Guiseley, Leeds, that means a 400-mile round trip and two days away from running her own business as her father lives in London. It is a train journey she has made many times in the last 15 years.  Her late mum, Beryl, once broke her knee in a fall and, in order for her to stay at home, Christine and her sister decided to divide up her care between them. ""Slowly, I realised I was running two households,"" Christine says. ""I was doing all their bills; I had more contact with their GP than mine."" As Beryl's health deteriorated and Christine tried to manage her mother's palliative care long-distance alongside managing her own life, she says she eventually reached breaking point. Becoming emotional, Christine explains: ""There were times I just wanted my mum to die because she was suffering."" Having packed for her latest trip to the South, Christine takes one train into Leeds city centre and then another one to London, before finally getting the tube to her father's house.  By the time she returns to Leeds, she will have been travelling for more than nine hours, all so she can accompany her father to a 10-minute appointment at a nearby pacemaker clinic. Christine says she has been lucky to have a ""really loving"" relationship with her parents, but at times she has found it overwhelming trying to support them to stay at home alongside continuing her own work. According to Dr Jackie Gray, Christine is far from alone. Dr Gray, a retired GP and public health consultant based in Northumberland, says she has watched the role adult children play in ageing parents' lives change ""dramatically"" over the course of her career.  She explains that when she first qualified, it was rare to see people living past 75. ""But, medical advancements, people living and working longer, as well as living further away from their parents, has caused a kind of perfect storm - a societal shift,"" she says. In 2020, after seeing increasing numbers of patients - usually women, she says - struggle with caring for their parents, Dr Gray launched the Carents Room website, offering forums and information. Dr Gray says ""nobody really knows"" how many ""carents"" there are, but a 2023 King's Fund report suggested that about 57% of unpaid carers were looking after a parent or grandparent. That means there could be up to four million people in this position in England alone, she says. A recent Carents Room survey of at least 1,000 members found more than half provided about 20 hours of care a week.  Meanwhile, 70% said they had reduced their working hours or left work altogether so they could care for their relatives. According to Dr Gray, family relationships can be complex and older people can find the idea of their children as carers upsetting - as can the grown-up children themselves. Relationships with siblings can also be fraught, she says. Plus, Dr Gray points out that ""carents"" can often struggle with what she calls a sense of ""anticipatory grief"". All of this means the support group she set up has seen a rise in people seeking help. ""We have a signed-up community of about 40,000 people, and that is growing by almost 100 people a day,"" she says. Common themes, including struggling with ""life admin"", appointments, travel, and balancing work commitments all emerge from the online forums and focus groups, Dr Gray explains. According to the Office of National Statistics (ONS), there were an estimated 1.4 million so-called ""sandwich"" carers - people who provide care for sick, disabled, or older adult relatives as well as for dependent children - in the UK between 2021 and 2023. The ONS found that 61% of ""sandwich"" carers were female. It also found that in England, the North East had the highest proportion of unpaid carers, at 10.1%, compared to other regions, as well as the highest proportion of people providing 50 or more hours of care. Meanwhile, according to figures compiled by Carers UK, in England and Wales, unpaid carers provided care worth £183bn in 2021-22 - an increase of £64.9bn since 2011. Dr Gray says that each family affected in this way has its own set of circumstances and, crucially, each family member has their own feelings about the situation. But, as the population lives longer and with more health needs, and with women also now expected to work for longer, the state's reliance on families to protect an already creaking social care system increases. Dr Gray says recognition and support are key. ""It can be hard for an adult child to accept they are a carer,"" she says. ""But once you've got that recognition in place and people feel heard, I think we're looking at really practical solutions,"" she says. Dr Gray explains that ""coordinating healthcare"" and ""opportunities for respite care"" could help people like Christine who care for elderly relatives.   She adds that she believes ""some sort of commissioner, a commissioner for frailty, perhaps"" should be introduced by the government.  Those taking part in Dr Gray's focus groups say more flexibility in appointment systems, as well as ""carental"" leave and tax breaks, might also help. A spokesperson for the government said it recognised ""the immense contribution of carers who selflessly dedicate their time to supporting others, and want families to receive the support they deserve.  ""We have increased the Carer's Allowance earnings threshold by around an additional £2,000 a year – the biggest rise since it was introduced in 1976. ""We have also launched an independent review into social care, which will include exploring the needs of unpaid carers who provide vital care and support."" Back in Leeds after her 400-mile round trip taking her father to his appointment, Christine Bell says at times she found it hard to think of herself as carer to her parents. ""I am, because without me, their house wouldn't have run, they wouldn't have had the care that they need,"" she says. ""But I want to be a daughter, first and foremost.""

2025-06-05,Article,Supreme Court rejects Mexico lawsuit against US gunmakers ,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/c1dez6rwz07o,"The US Supreme Court has blocked a lawsuit brought by Mexico that sought to hold American gunmakers accountable for playing a role in country's struggle with drug cartels. The court voted 9-0 to reject the suit, in the process upholding a 2005 law that shields gun manufacturers from liability if weapons they produce are misused. Mexico's government had argued that the ""flood"" of illegal guns across the border is a result of ""deliberate"" practices by US firms that they say appealed to cartel members with their products.  The decision overturns a lower court's ruling that allowed the suit, brought against manufacturer Smith & Wesson and wholesaler Interstate Arms, to proceed. Mexico's original lawsuit was filed in 2021 against eight gun manufacturers, but the cases against six of them were dismissed by a district court.  The Supreme Court has now rejected the suit in its entirety, agreeing the case satisfied an exception to the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA), which limits the liability of gun manufactures.  In its complaint, the Mexican government argued that the gun manufacturers ""supply firearms to retail dealers whom they know illegally sell to Mexican gun traffickers"". It also claimed that the manufacturers did not impose any controls on their distribution networks to prevent the sale of these weapons to traffickers in Mexico.  The Supreme Court said Mexico's complaint ""does not plausibly allege that the defendant manufacturers aided and abetted gun dealers' unlawful sales of firearms to Mexican traffickers"". The court said it has ""little doubt"" some guns are sold to Mexican firearm traffickers. However, it added that the government had been unable to prove that the manufacturers ""participate in"" those sales, as its complaint did not identify any specific criminal transactions.  Mexico's accusation was more general, the court said - that the manufacturers help a number of unidentified ""rogue gun dealers"" sell firearms illegally. This case is the first time the court has taken up the PLCAA shield law, which limits the ability of victims of gun violence to sue firearms manufacturers and dealers for the misuse of their products.  At a hearing in March, the court appeared sceptical of Mexico's challenge, with justices on both sides of the ideological spectrum questioning the validity of the suit.  An investigation by the BBC's US partner CBS News revealed that between 200,000 and 500,000 US-made firearms are trafficked to Mexico each year.  Almost half the guns recovered at crime scenes in Mexico are manufactured in the US, CBS reported citing data from the US' Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Copyright 2025 BBC.

2025-06-05,Article,First bacteria we ever meet can keep us out of hospital,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/cgr5lej9l8lo,"The first bacteria our bodies meet – in the hours after we're born – could protect us from dangerous infections, UK scientists say. They have shown, for the first time, that good bacteria seem to halve the risk of young children being admitted to hospital with lung infections. The researchers said it was a ""phenomenal"" finding and could lead to therapies that boost good bacteria in babies. Our early encounters with microbes are thought to be crucial in how our immune system develops. We come out of the womb sterile, but this doesn't last for long. All the nooks and crannies of the human body become home to a world of microbial life, known as the microbiome. Researchers at University College London and the Sanger Institute investigated the earliest stages in our body's colonisation by bacteria, fungi and more. They collected stool samples from 1,082 newborns in the first week of life. The team then performed a massive genetic analysis on all the DNA in the samples to work out exactly which species were present and how common they were in each child. They then tracked what happened to those babies, using hospital data, for the next two years. One particular early inhabitant of the human body, Bifidobacterium longum, seemed to have a protective effect. Only 4% of babies with this species would spend a night in hospital with a lung infection over the next two years. Babies with different starter-bacteria were two-to-three times more likely to need to stay in hospital. It is the first data to show the formation of the microbiome affects the risk of infection. ""I think it's really phenomenal. It's amazing to be able to show this. I'm excited,"" Prof Nigel Field, from UCL, told the BBC.  The most likely culprit for children ending up in hospital is respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), but what joins the dots between this and B. longum? That is the ""million dollar question"" for Prof Field. We know B. longum starts off digesting breast milk which both contains food for the baby and encourages good bacteria.  The exact details have not yet been worked out, but either the bacteria themselves or the compounds they make by digesting food are interacting with the immune system ""and are influencing the way in which the immune system matures and is able to recognise friend from foe,"" according to Prof Field. The protective bacteria were found only in babies that came into the world via a vaginal delivery rather than a caesarean. Even then they were not discovered after every vaginal delivery. The researchers say their findings do not justify the practice of vaginal seeding,  where some new parents smear babies with a swab taken from the vagina. The good bacteria seem to be coming from the end of the mother's digestive system, an idea known in the field as the ""first lick"". ""I feel pretty confident in saying that vaginal seeding is not a good thing,"" said Prof Field. However, the long-term ambition is to come up with microbial therapies – like a probiotic yogurt – that could be given to babies to set their microbiomes on a healthy path. Prof Louise Kenny, from the University of Liverpool and a consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist, said: ""A caesarean section is often a life-saving procedure, and can be the right choice for a woman and her baby."" She said that while the benefit was seen only in babies born vaginally, it was not in every child born that way so ""further research is needed to create a full, nuanced picture"".

The Supreme Court said Mexico's complaint ""does not plausibly allege that the defendant manufacturers aided and abetted gun dealers' unlawful sales of firearms to Mexican traffickers"". The court said it has ""little doubt"" some guns are sold to Mexican firearm traffickers. However, it added that the government had been unable to prove that the manufacturers ""participate in"" those sales, as its complaint did not identify any specific criminal transactions.  Mexico's accusation was more general, the court said - that the manufacturers help a number of unidentified ""rogue gun dealers"" sell firearms illegally. This case is the first time the court has taken up the PLCAA shield law, which limits the ability of victims of gun violence to sue firearms manufacturers and dealers for the misuse of their products.  At a hearing in March, the court appeared sceptical of Mexico's challenge, with justices on both sides of the ideological spectrum questioning the validity of the suit.  An investigation by the BBC's US partner CBS News revealed that between 200,000 and 500,000 US-made firearms are trafficked to Mexico each year.  Almost half the guns recovered at crime scenes in Mexico are manufactured in the US, CBS reported citing data from the US' Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Copyright 2025 BBC.

2025-06-05,Article,Stores open at midnight as fans rush to buy Nintendo Switch 2,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/ckgxwe774zwo,"The Nintendo Switch 2 has been released worldwide, with stores opening at midnight so fans could get their hands on the long-awaited console the moment it became available. Some shops have the devices available to buy off the shelf - but in most cases customers have been picking up consoles they had ordered in advance, with UK retailer Currys calling it its ""biggest gaming pre-order ever."" Despite the excitement there have been some setbacks, with one supplier, Game, cancelling some pre-orders.  In the US, Nintendo briefly pulled Switch 2 pre-orders in April over concerns around tariffs before starting again a few weeks later. But that doesn't appear to have put fans off- with queues forming at stores around the world as gamers vied to be among the first to unbox their new console. Currys told the BBC it had sold 30,000 units - which it attributed to the ""incredible excitement"" associated with the launch. Despite the initial excitement, questions remain over whether the Switch 2 will match the success of its predecessor - the third-best selling console in history - in part because of its high game prices. A physical copy of its most high-profile game, Mario Kart World, comes in at £74.99 - £15 more expensive than a typical Switch title. The original Nintendo Switch has shifted more than 150 million units since its 2017 release. A successor has been in the works for years - so perhaps unsurprisingly Tushar Sandarka, the President of the University of York's Mario Kart society, is among those excited about the launch, and the new version of Mario coming with it. ""It's coming out with Mario Kart World - which is the first since 2014 - it's a big deal for us,"" the 19-year-old said. ""Securing a pre-order was such a tough decision because it's so expensive.  ""Even if it's a bit higher than I would have wanted to pay for it, it's going to serve me well for the next 7 or 8 years."" But not everyone the BBC spoke to said they would be picking up the console on launch. Mae and Lottie, both students in York, said they would stick to the original Switch because of the cost. ""It's quite spenny,"" Mae said. ""What we've got is fine."" Lottie agreed, but said she was disappointed not to play on the new Mario Kart game - which she said could cost her as much as ""a day's pay"".  ""I'm not spending that on a game,"" she said. For Nintendo, the Switch 2 represents a change in strategy - in the past its new devices have been given an entirely new name. ""This is the first time Nintendo has ever launched a straight sequel,"" GamesRadar+ brand director Sam Loveridge told the BBC.  ""It's a clear proposition for consumers - they know exactly what they're getting from this console if they are familiar with the original Switch."" She said ""everything is pointing to"" pre-orders having sold well.  ""When pre-orders first went live, it was an absolute scramble to find any stock, but Nintendo was clearly prepared and since those early weeks, it's been a lot easier to secure yourself a console for launch day,"" she said. I was one of the lucky few to get my hands on the Switch 2 at an event in April. Like its predecessor, it is a ""hybrid"" console - a handheld device which can also be plugged into a TV to play on the big screen. But it has a bigger and brighter screen, along with lots more power and storage. It still has a bit of innovation - you can use the controller like a computer mouse by twisting it on its side, making PC games such as Civilization VII a more enjoyable experience than using joysticks. But many of the showcase Nintendo games on display at that event  - including Metroid Prime 4, Donkey Kong: Bananza, and Super Mario Party Jamboree TV - won't be available at launch. Instead the only new Nintendo game on the new console will be Mario Kart World, barring a small title called Welcome Tour which showcases some of the new hardware. ""It might seem like an odd bet, but with the original Mario Kart 8 being the best-selling Wii U game and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe being the best-selling Nintendo Switch game, there's a very established audience there,"" Ms Loveridge said. The gaming giant is also releasing on day one upgraded versions of the Switch's Legend of Zelda games, Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom, which take advantage of the console's greater power. Beyond that, gamers will have to look to third-party games for alternatives on launch. The range of games includes Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma, Cyberpunk 2077, and Bravely Default. ""This more powerful console offers plenty of opportunities for third-party games publishers bringing Nintendo into more direct competition with Sony and Microsoft,"" said Katie Holt, senior games industry research analyst at Ampere Analysis . And fans can expect more from third-party games as the console develops too - with Nintendo senior director Takuhiro Dohta telling me he expected games to get even better. ""When there are software titles set for the launch of the hardware, the developers still don't fully know the capabilities and hardware well enough,"" he said.  ""As developers continue to develop, they start to understand how it works and what it's capable of, so I think we can expect improvements not only in graphics but in gameplay too.""

2025-06-05,Article,Rare oil portrait of Mahatma Gandhi to be auctioned in London,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/cp3nl6gq7vlo,"A rare oil portrait of Indian independence leader Mahatma Gandhi - painted in 1931 in the UK - will be auctioned in London next month. Gandhi led a non-violent resistance movement against British rule in India and his teachings have inspired millions. Most Indians revere him as the ""father of the nation"". Over the years, several paintings, drawings and sketches of him have circulated around the world.  The auction house Bonhams says the painting, made by British artist Clare Leighton, is ""thought to be the only oil portrait that Gandhi actually sat for"". The portrait was made when Gandhi went to London in 1931 for the second Round Table conference, held to discuss constitutional reforms for India and address its demands for self-governance.  It will be auctioned in the second week of July at Bonhams.  ""This is a painting of unique historic and cultural significance. It would be great if it could be seen and appreciated more widely, whether in India or elsewhere,"" Caspar Leighton, a great nephew of the artist, told the BBC. According to Bonhams, Clare Leighton ""was one of the very few artists admitted to his office and was given the opportunity to sit with on multiple occasions to sketch and paint his likeness"". The works remained in the artist's collection until her death in 1989 in the US, after which it was passed down through her family. She was introduced to Gandhi through her partner and British political journalist, Henry Noel Brailsford, who was a strong supporter of India's independence movement. In November 1931, Leighton showcased her portraits of Gandhi at an exhibition at the Albany Galleries in London.  Though Gandhi did not attend the opening event, several representatives from the Indian delegation of the second Round Table were present.  Among them was Sarojini Naidu, also an eminent Indian independence leader, who was one of the key advisors to Gandhi at the meeting.  The exhibition included a charcoal sketch of Gandhi, asleep in his office, along with the oil portrait that is now set to be auctioned.  About the painting of Gandhi, British Journalist Winifred Holtby wrote: ""The little man squats bare-headed, in his blanket, one finger raised, as it often is to emphasise a point, his mouth parted for a word that is almost a smile"". The following month, Gandhi's personal secretary Mahadev Desai wrote to Leighton, saying, ""many of my friends who saw it [the oil portrait] in the Albany Gallery said to me that it was a good likeness"". There doesn't seem to be any public record of the oil portrait being displayed elsewhere until 1978, when the Boston Public Library organised an exhibition of Leighton's works. However, according to the artist's family, the portrait was thought to have been on display in the 1970s in the US, where it was allegedly damaged in a knife attack.  A label attached to the backing board of the portrait says it was restored by the Lyman Allyn Museum Conservation Laboratory in Connecticut in 1974. The details of the alleged attack are not clear - according to Bonhams, it was carried out by a right-wing Hindu activist.  Hindu hardliners in India accuse Gandhi of having betrayed Hindus by being too pro-Muslim, and blame him for the division of India and the bloodshed that marked Partition, which saw India and Pakistan created after independence in 1947. He was shot dead on 30 January 1948 at a prayer meeting by Nathuram Godse, an activist with nationalist right-wing groups. Copyright 2025 BBC.

2025-06-05,Article,First bacteria we ever meet can keep us out of hospital,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/cgr5lej9l8lo,"The first bacteria our bodies meet – in the hours after we're born – could protect us from dangerous infections, UK scientists say. They have shown, for the first time, that good bacteria seem to halve the risk of young children being admitted to hospital with lung infections. The researchers said it was a ""phenomenal"" finding and could lead to therapies that boost good bacteria in babies. Our early encounters with microbes are thought to be crucial in how our immune system develops. We come out of the womb sterile, but this doesn't last for long. All the nooks and crannies of the human body become home to a world of microbial life, known as the microbiome. Researchers at University College London and the Sanger Institute investigated the earliest stages in our body's colonisation by bacteria, fungi and more. They collected stool samples from 1,082 newborns in the first week of life. The team then performed a massive genetic analysis on all the DNA in the samples to work out exactly which species were present and how common they were in each child. They then tracked what happened to those babies, using hospital data, for the next two years. One particular early inhabitant of the human body, Bifidobacterium longum, seemed to have a protective effect. Only 4% of babies with this species would spend a night in hospital with a lung infection over the next two years. Babies with different starter-bacteria were two-to-three times more likely to need to stay in hospital. It is the first data to show the formation of the microbiome affects the risk of infection. ""I think it's really phenomenal. It's amazing to be able to show this. I'm excited,"" Prof Nigel Field, from UCL, told the BBC.  The most likely culprit for children ending up in hospital is respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), but what joins the dots between this and B. longum? That is the ""million dollar question"" for Prof Field. We know B. longum starts off digesting breast milk which both contains food for the baby and encourages good bacteria.  The exact details have not yet been worked out, but either the bacteria themselves or the compounds they make by digesting food are interacting with the immune system ""and are influencing the way in which the immune system matures and is able to recognise friend from foe,"" according to Prof Field. The protective bacteria were found only in babies that came into the world via a vaginal delivery rather than a caesarean. Even then they were not discovered after every vaginal delivery. The researchers say their findings do not justify the practice of vaginal seeding,  where some new parents smear babies with a swab taken from the vagina. The good bacteria seem to be coming from the end of the mother's digestive system, an idea known in the field as the ""first lick"". ""I feel pretty confident in saying that vaginal seeding is not a good thing,"" said Prof Field. However, the long-term ambition is to come up with microbial therapies – like a probiotic yogurt – that could be given to babies to set their microbiomes on a healthy path. Prof Louise Kenny, from the University of Liverpool and a consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist, said: ""A caesarean section is often a life-saving procedure, and can be the right choice for a woman and her baby."" She said that while the benefit was seen only in babies born vaginally, it was not in every child born that way so ""further research is needed to create a full, nuanced picture"".

2025-06-04,Article,Meghan shares new photos of Lilibet to mark fourth birthday,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cewd79ey270o,"The Duchess of Sussex has posted a video of her dancing while pregnant with Princess Lilibet four years ago to mark her daughter's birthday.  The video features Meghan and the Duke of Sussex dance and gyrate in a hospital room.  The couple were recreating a TikTok challenge which sees pregnant women and their partners dance to a song called Baby Mama Dance.  She wrote on Instagram: ""Four years ago today, this also happened. Both of our children were a week past their due dates... so when spicy food, all that walking, and acupuncture didn't work - there was only one thing left to do!"" It is not known if the dance challenge, created by comic Cameron Henderson in 2013 and includes the lyrics ""been pregnant for way too long"", did indeed induce Meghan's labour.  The post came after a series of posts by the duchess sharing intimate family photos of four-year-old Princess Lilibet.  Meghan shared a black-and-white snap of her cuddling her daughter, who is sitting on her lap, with the pair both sporting windswept hair, appearing to be on a boat.  The second image shows Meghan tenderly cradling the princess as a newborn following her birth in 2021.  Meghan wrote: ""Happy birthday to our beautiful girl! Four years ago today she came into our lives – and each day is brighter and better because of it. ""Thanks to all of those sending love and celebrating her special day!"" The duchess also released an image of a newborn Princess Lillibet looking up at her father.  Another image shows the duke and his daughter in a dress walking bare feet in the sand, with their backs turned to the camera, surrounded by palm trees.  ""The sweetest bond to watch unfold,"" she said of the pictures. ""Daddy's little girl and favourite adventurer. Happy birthday Lili!"" Meghan usually only shares photos of the princess pictured from behind to protect her privacy, but in one of the newly released photos you can see Lilibet's eyes and top half of her face, with the bottom half covered by Meghan's arms as she hugs her daughter.  The princess - the youngest child of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex - was born on 4 June 2021, a year after her parents stepped back from being senior royals and moved to the US. She became a princess when her grandfather the King became monarch.  The couple also share Prince Archie, aged six.   On Tuesday, Meghan said she wondered about launching a future business with her daughter as she chatted to Beyonce's mother Tina Knowles on her podcast Confessions Of A Female Founder.  ""I wonder if one day I'll be in business with Lili and we'll be building something,"" the duchess said, with Knowles adding: ""That's the best."" Last week, the duchess shared a clip of her and the princess beekeeping in protective suits, writing: ""Like mother, like daughter; she's even wearing my gloves.""  Lilibet is named after her great-grandmother Queen Elizabeth II.  The nickname was coined when then-Princess Elizabeth was a toddler and could not pronounce her own name properly.  Her grandfather King George V would affectionately call her Lilibet, imitating her attempts to say her name. It stuck and came to be used by close relatives.

2025-06-04,Article,South Korea's new president has a Trump-shaped crisis to avert,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpvkxxerln1o,"South Korea's new president, Lee Jae-myung, has secured a storming victory, but his honeymoon will barely last the day. The former opposition leader is not getting to enjoy the two-month transition period usually afforded to new leaders, so they can build their team and nail down their vision for the country.  Instead he is entering office immediately, to fill the hole left by the impeachment of the former president, Yoon Suk Yeol, who last December tried and failed to bring the country under martial law. In electing Lee, with almost 50% of the vote , South Koreans have vehemently rejected the military dictatorship that was almost forced upon them. Lee campaigned on the promise that he would strengthen South Korea's democracy and unite the country, after a divisive and tumultuous six months. But that will have to wait. First, he has a Donald Trump shaped crisis to avert. In the coming months, Trump has the power to destabilise South Korea's economy, its security, and its volatile relationship with North Korea. South Koreans were dismayed when Trump slapped 25% tariffs on all Korean imports in April, after already hitting the country with aggressive tariffs on its core industries – steel and cars. They had assumed that being longstanding military allies from the days of the Korean War, and having a free-trade agreement with the US, would spare them. If these tariffs take effect ""they could trigger an economic crisis"", a seasoned advisor to Lee's Democratic Party, Moon Chung-in, said.  Before Trump's announcements, South Korea's economy was already slowing down. The martial law chaos constricted it further. Then, in the first quarter of this year, it contracted. Fixing this has been voters' number one demand, even above fixing their beleaguered democracy. But without a president, talks with Trump have been on hold. They cannot be put off any longer. And there is much more than South Korea's economy at stake in these negotiations. The US currently guarantees South Korea's security by promising to come to its defence with both conventional and nuclear weapons were it to be attacked by its nuclear-armed neighbour, North Korea. As part of this deal there are 28,500 US troops stationed in the South. Yet Trump has made clear he does not plan to differentiate between trade and security when negotiating with the country, signalling that Seoul is not pulling its weight in either area. In a post on his Truth Social platform in April, Trump said that during initial tariff talks with South Korea he had ""discussed payment for the big time military protection we provide"", calling it ""beautiful and efficient one-stop shopping"". This approach makes Seoul uniquely vulnerable.  Evans Revere, a former senior US diplomat based in Seoul, fears a crisis is coming. ""For the first time in our lifetime we have a US president who does not feel a moral and strategic obligation towards Korea"". In his first term as president, Trump questioned the value of having US forces stationed in Korea and threatened to withdraw them unless Seoul paid more to have them. It seems likely he will demand more money this time around. Seoul may not want to pay more, but it can afford to. A bigger problem is that Trump's calculations, and that of his defence department, seem to have changed. This is no longer just about the money. Washington's top priority now in Asia is not just stopping North Korea attacking the South, it is also to contain China's military ambitions in the region and against Taiwan. Last year, a now-senior US defence official, Elbridge Colby, said that South Korea was going to have to take ""overwhelming responsibility for its own self-defence against North Korea"", so the US could be ready to fight China. One option is that the troops stationed here would switch their focus to constraining China. Another, touted by a couple of US defence officials last month, is that thousands of soldiers would be removed from the peninsula altogether and redeployed, and that Seoul's military would also have to play a role in deterring Beijing. Not only could this put South Korea in a dangerous military predicament, but it would also create a diplomatically difficult one. President Lee, who historically has been sceptical of Korea's alliance with the US, wants to use his presidency to improve relations with China, South Korea's powerful neighbour and trading partner. He has stated several times that South Korea should stay out of a conflict between China and Taiwan. ""We must keep our distance from a China-Taiwan contingency. We can get along with both"", he said during a televised debate last month. The political advisor Mr Moon, who once served as national security advisor, reiterated Lee's concerns. ""We are worried about America abandoning us, but at the same time we are worried about being entrapped in American strategy to contain and encircle China"", he said. ""If the US threatens us, we can let [the forces] go"", he said. For Mr Revere, the former US diplomat, this combination of Lee, Trump and China threatens to create ""the perfect storm"". ""The two leaders may find themselves on very different pages and that could be a recipe for a problematic relationship. If this plays out, it would undermine peace and stability in North East Asia"". In Pyongyang, Kim Jong Un will no doubt be watching closely, keen to exploit the shifting ground. His nuclear weapons programme is more dangerous than ever, and nothing or no-one has been able to convince him to wind it down - including Donald Trump who, during his first term, was the first US president to ever meet a North Korean leader. Since returning to office Trump has indicated he would like to resume talks with Kim, which ended without agreement in 2019. In Seoul, there is real concern that this time the pair could strike a deal that is very bad for South Korea. The fear is that Trump would take an ""America first"" approach, and ask Kim to stop producing his intercontinental ballistic missiles that threaten the US mainland, without addressing the multiple short-range nuclear weapons pointed at Seoul. And in return, Kim could demand a high price. Kim has far more leverage than he did in 2019. He has more nuclear warheads, his weapons are more advanced, and the sanctions that were supposed to put pressure on his regime have all but collapsed, thanks largely to Vladimir Putin. The Russian leader is providing Kim with economic and military support in return for North Korea's help fighting the war in Ukraine. This therefore gives Kim the cover to make more audacious requests of the US. He could ask Trump to accept North Korea as a nuclear weapons state, and agree to a deal that would reduce Pyongyang's weapons count rather than get rid of them altogether. Another of his requests could likely be for the US to remove some of the security it provides South Korea, including the troops. ""North Korea is in the driver's seat now. The only curveball is how much risk President Trump will take"", said Sydney Seiler, who was involved in the 2019 negotiations on the US side. ""The idea there might be some sort of troop withdrawal [included in a deal] is really not that far-fetched"". Mr Seiler stressed that the US would ""not leave South Korea in the dust,"" but advised South Korea's new president to ""establish a relationship with Trump early on"", and be clear they expect to be part of any process, if talks materialise. The new president must move quickly on all fronts, added Mr Revere, arguing that Lee's first homework assignment should be to come up with a list of 10 reasons why South Korea is an indispensable partner and why American dollars are being well spent; reasons that can convince a sceptical and transactional Trump. One Ace card South Korea is hoping to play is its shipbuilding prowess. It builds more vessels than any other country bar China, which is now the world's dominant ship builder and home to the largest naval fleet. This is a frightening prospect for the US whose own industry and navy are in decline. Last month I visited South Korea's flagship shipyard in Ulsan on the south coast - the largest in the world – where Hyundai Heavy Industries builds 40-50 new ships a year, including naval destroyers. Sturdy cranes slotted together sheets of metal, creating vessels the size of small villages. Seoul is hoping it can use this expertise to build, repair and maintain warships for the US, and in the process convince Washington it is a valuable partner. ""US shipbuilding difficulties are affecting their national security"", said Jeong Woo Maan, head of strategy for Hyundai's naval and ship unit. ""This is one of the strongest cards we have to negotiate with"". In his campaign for president, Lee Jae-myung declared he did not want to rush into any agreements with Trump. Now in office, he could quickly find himself without this luxury.  Copyright 2025 BBC.

2025-06-04,Article,"Cologne evacuates 20,000 so WW2 bombs can be defused",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj6r04e870do,"Authorities in the German city of Cologne have defused three unexploded World War Two bombs after the evacuation of more than 20,000 people. Bomb squad technicians deactivated the American bombs on Wednesday after evacuating an area of around 10,000 sq m (107,639 sq ft) following their discovery in a shipyard in Deutz on Monday. Homes, shops, hotels and schools were told to evacuate, as well as a large hospital and a major train station in what the city called ""the largest operation since WW2"". Cologne was subjected to particularly heavy bombing during WW2 and unexploded ordnance can still pose a danger. Germany's bomb disposal service was only able to begin the operation after all residents in the densely populated area were evacuated. ""If you refuse, we will escort you from your home - if necessary by force - along with the police,"" the authorities said.  Residents were told if they refused to leave their homes after the evacuation began they could face expensive fines.  Some intensive care patients were helped out in ambulances from the Eduardus Hospital.  Finding bombs from WW2 is not unusual in German cities such as Cologne and Berlin, but these bombs were particularly large. The evacuation in the Old Town and Deutz neighbourhoods began with officials going door to door to tell people they must leave their homes.  Many of the city's usually bustling streets were eerily deserted as shops, restaurants and businesses were told to stop operating during the day.  Cultural institutions including the Philharmonic Hall and many museums were also affected, as well as government buildings, 58 hotels, and nine schools.  Transport was severely disrupted, with all roads closed in the area, many trains cancelled and the Messe/Deutz train station was closed from 08:00 local time (07:00BST).  The authorities had set up two drop-in centres for people who did not have anywhere to go during the evacuation period.  Residents were told to ""stay calm"", bring their ID and any essential medications, and to take care of their pets.  For some people, the evacuation was more than a little inconvenient.  Fifteen couples were scheduled to get married at Cologne's historic town hall but the ceremonies were relocated to a location in another part of the city, local media reported.  This story has been updated to remove an incorrect description of the size of the bombs. Copyright 2025 BBC.

Detained after being accused of controlling the illegal operations at an abandoned gold mine near Stilfontein in South Africa, where 78 corpses were discovered underground in January, Tiger escaped custody, police allege. Four policemen, alleged to have aided his breakout, are out on bail and awaiting trial, but the authorities appear no closer to learning the fugitive's whereabouts. We went to Lesotho to find out more about this elusive man and to hear from those affected by the subterranean deaths. Tiger's home is near the city of Mokhotlong, a five-hour drive from the capital, Maseru, on the road that skirts the nation's mountains. We visit his elderly mother, Mampho Tshoaeli, and his younger brother, Thabiso. Unlike Tiger, Thabiso decided to stay at home and rear sheep for a living, rather than join the illegal miners, known as zama zamas, in South Africa. Neither of them has seen Tiger in eight years. ""He was a friendly child to everyone,"" Ms Tshoaeli recalls.  ""He was peaceful even at school, his teachers never complained about him. So generally, he was a good person,"" she says. Thabiso, five years younger than Tiger, says they both used to look after the family sheep when they were children. ""When we were growing up he wanted to be a policeman. That was his dream. But that never happened because, when our father passed away, he had to become the head of the family."" Tiger, who was 21 at the time, decided to follow in his father's footsteps and headed to South Africa to work in a mine - but not in the formal sector. ""It was really hard for me,"" says his mother. ""I really felt worried for him because he was still fragile and young at that time. Also because I was told that to go down into the mine, they used a makeshift lift."" He would come back when he got time off or for Christmas. And during that first stint as a zama zama his mother said he was the family's main provider. ""He really supported us a lot. He was supporting me, giving me everything, even his siblings. He made sure that they had clothes and food."" The last time his family saw or heard from him was in 2017 when he left Lesotho with his then wife. Shortly after, the couple separated. ""I thought maybe he'd remarried, and his second wife wasn't allowing him to come back home,"" she says sadly. ""I've been asking: 'Where is my son?' ""The first time I heard he was a zama zama at Stilfontein, I was told by my son. He came to my house holding his phone and he showed me the news on social media and explained that they were saying he escaped from the police."" The police say several illegal miners described him as one of the Stilfontein ring leaders. His mother does not believe he could have been in this position and says seeing the coverage of him has been upsetting. ""It really hurts me a lot because I think maybe he will die there, or maybe he has died already, or if he's lucky to come back home, maybe I won't be here. I'll be among the dead."" A friend of Tiger's from Stilfontein, who only wants to be identified as Ayanda, tells me they used to share food and cigarettes before supplies dwindled.  He also casts doubt on the ""ringleader"" label, saying that Tiger was more middle management. ""He was a boss underground, but he's not a top boss. He was like a supervisor, someone who could manage the situation where we were working."" Mining researcher Makhotla Sefuli thinks it was unlikely that Tiger was at the top of the illegal mining syndicate in Stilfontein. He says those in charge never work underground. ""The illegal mining trade is like a pyramid with many tiers. We always pay attention to the bottom tier, which is the workers. They are the ones who are underground. ""But there is a second layer… they supply cash to the illegal miners. ""Then you've got the buyers… they buy [the gold] from those who are supplying cash to the illegal miners."" At the top are ""some very powerful"" people, with ""close proximity to top politicians"". These people make the most money, but do not get their hands dirty in the mines. Supang Khoaisanyane was one of those at the bottom of the pyramid and he paid with his life. The 39-year-old's body was among those discovered in the disused gold mine in January. He, like many of the others who perished, had migrated to South Africa from Lesotho. Walking into his village, Bobete, in the Thaba-Tseka district, feels like stepping back in time. The journey there is full of obstacles. After crossing a rickety bridge barely wide enough to hold our car, we are faced with a long drive up unpaved mountain roads with no safety barriers. More than once it feels likely we will not make it to the top. But when we do, the scenery is pristine. Seemingly untouched by modernity. Dozens of small, thatched huts, their walls made from mountain stone, dot the rolling green hills. Right next door to the late Supang's family home is the unfinished house he was building for his wife and three children.  Unlike most of the dwellings in the village, the house is made of cement, but it is missing a roof, windows and doors. The empty spaces are an unintentional memorial to a man who wanted to help his family. ""He left the village because he was struggling,"" his aunt Mabolokang Khoaisanyane tells me.  Next to her Supang's wife and one of his children lay down on a mattress on the floor, staring sadly into space. ""He was trying to find money in Stilfontein, to feed his family, and to put some roofing on his house,"" Ms Khoaisanyane says. The house was built with money raised from a previous work trip to South Africa by Supang - a trip that many of those from Lesotho have made over the decades drawn by the opportunities of the much richer neighbour. His aunt adds that before he left the second time, three years ago, his job prospects at home were non-existent. ""It's very terrible here, that's why he left. Because here all you can do is work on short government projects. But you work for a short time and then that's it."" This landlocked country - entirely surrounded by South Africa - is one of the poorest in the world. Unemployment stands at 30% but for young people the rate is almost 50%, according to official figures. Supang's family say they did not realise he was working as a zama zama until a relative called them to say he had died underground. They thought he had been working in construction and had not heard from him since he left Bobete in 2022. Ms Khoaisanyane says that during the phone call, they were told that what caused the deaths of most of those underground in Stilfontein was a lack of food and water. Many of the more than 240 who were rescued came out very ill. Stilfontein made global headlines late last year when the police implemented a controversial new strategy to crack down on illegal mining. They restricted the flow of food and water into the mine in an attempt to ""smoke out"" the workers, as one South African minister put it. In January, a court order forced the government to launch a rescue operation. Supang's family say they understand what he was doing was illegal but they disagree with how the authorities dealt with the situation. ""They tortured these people with hunger, not allowing food and medication to be sent down. It makes us really sad that he was down there without food for that long. We believe this is what ended his life,"" his aunt says. The dead miner's family have finally received his body and buried him near his  half-finished home. But Tiger's mother and brother are still waiting for news about him. The South African police say the search continues, though it is not clear if they have got any closer to finding him.

2025-06-04,Article,The Indian pilot set for a historic space journey on Axiom-4,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce80glkl7nno,"The Axiom Mission 4 (Ax-4), set to take off from Nasa's Kennedy Space Center in Florida next week, will be piloted by an Indian as it soars towards the International Space Station (ISS). Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla of the Indian air force is among the four-member multi-country crew of Ax-4 that will be spending two weeks on the ISS. The flight, scheduled for 10 June at 08:22 EDT (12:22GMT; 17:52IST), has generated a huge interest in India as Group Captain Shukla will only be the second Indian ever to travel to space and the first to visit the ISS. The trip comes 41 years after cosmonaut Rakesh Sharma became the first Indian to fly to space aboard a Russian Soyuz in 1984. He spent nearly eight days there. Ax-4 is led by former Nasa astronaut Peggy Whitson - a space veteran who has been commander of ISS twice, spent hundreds of days in space and done 10 space walks.  The team also includes Slawosz Uznanski-Wisniewski from Poland and Tibor Kapu from Hungary - just like the Indian astronaut, they will also be taking their countries back to space after more than four decades.  Experts say the pilot's role is key, as he would serve as second-in-command to the mission commander, assisting with spacecraft operations during launch, docking, undocking and return to Earth. The astronauts, who have been in quarantine since 25 May to prepare for the trip, addressed a press conference on Tuesday night where they showed-off Joy - a small, white toy swan they said would be ""the fifth crew member"" on Ax-4. ""We are good for the launch, we have completed all the training and the team has bonded well,"" Commander Whitson said. Describing the past year as ""nothing short of transformative"" for him, Group Captain Shukla said he did not have words to describe his excitement. ""It has been an amazing journey so far, but the best is yet to come,"" he said.  ""As I go into space, I carry not just instruments and equipment, I carry hopes and dreams of a billion hearts. ""I request all Indians to pray for the success of our mission,"" he added. The 39-year-old was among four Indian air force officers shortlisted last year to travel on the country's first-ever human space flight, scheduled for 2027. The Gaganyaan mission aims to send three astronauts to an orbit of 400km and bring them back after three days. India has also announced ambitious plans to set up a space station by 2035 and send an astronaut to the Moon by 2040. India's space agency Isro has been carrying out a number of tests to prepare for Gaganyaan. In December, it plans to send a female humanoid robot to space as part of the tests. So, officials say the mission comes as a ""unique exciting opportunity"" for Isro and has generated a lot of interest in India. The trip to ISS aboard Ax-4 - a commercial flight operated by Houston-based private company Axiom Space - is a collaborative effort between Nasa, Isro and European Space Agency (Esa). Tuesday's flight will be launched using the SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule on a Falcon 9 rocket.  Isro, which has paid 5bn rupees ($59m; £43m) to secure a seat for Group Captain Shukla and his training, says the experience he will gain during his trip to the ISS will help India immensely. ""The benefit we will get from this mission is phenomenal in terms of the training, exposure to the facilities and the experience of jointly conducting experiments in space,"" Isro Chairman V Narayanan recently said. Sudeesh Balan, Isro project director, said Group Captain Shukla had been training since August last year.  ""He's undergone rigorous training, including physical and psychological assessments, to prepare for the journey."" Born on 10 October 1985 in the northern city of Lucknow, Group Captain Shukla joined the Indian air force as a fighter pilot in 2006.  According to Axiom Space, he has over 2,000 hours of flying experience and has flown MiGs, Sukhois, Dorniers, Jaguars and Hawks. His sister Shuchi Mishra, however, told the BBC that his entry into the air force was ""accidental"". ""When he was 17 and in high school, his friend got a form to apply to the National Defence Academy. But this friend was slightly overage so he was not qualified. Not wanting to waste the form, Shubhanshu filled it up,"" Ms Mishra said. ""He was selected - and has never looked back."" Ms Mishra says their family ""is thrilled as one of ours has been chosen out of India's 1.4 billion people"" for this mission. ""We all feel so privileged and proud that he's a part of our family and that we've been a part of his journey."" Her brother, she says, is undertaking this journey for his country - for the next generation. ""He always tells people to dream big, to do something for the nation. We are hoping that his trip will inspire the next generation."" Besides piloting the mission, the Indian astronaut will have a busy schedule during his time on ISS. Considering the huge interest in the flight, Isro has said they are organising events for him to interact with Indian students and answer their questions while floating in space. ""We believe it will motivate our young minds to become passionate about space tech,"" Mr Balan said. But most of the time, the four-member crew will be conducting 60 scientific experiments, seven of which come from India.  Former Nasa scientist Mila Mitra says Isro's experiments will help improve our understanding of space and its effects on biology and micro-gravity. One of the key experiments, she explains, will investigate the impact of spaceflight on six varieties of crop seeds.  ""This project aims to help understand how crops may be grown in space for future exploration missions. After the mission, seeds will be grown for multiple generations and plants showing preferred traits will be selected for genetic analyses."" Another Isro experiment involves growing three strains of microalgae which could be used as food, fuel or even in life support systems and this will help identify the most suitable ones for growing in microgravity, she says. The Isro projects would also investigate how tardigrades - micro-animals on Earth that can survive extreme environments - would fare in space.  ""The project will examine the revival of dormant tardigrades, count the number of eggs laid and hatched during a mission, and compare space-flown versus ground control populations,"" Ms Mitra says. The other experiments aim to identify how muscle loss occurs in space and how it can be treated; and the physical and cognitive impact of using computer screens in microgravity.  ""The research will study how gaze fixation and rapid eye movements are affected by being in space, and how this may affect an astronaut's stress and wellbeing. The results could influence future spacecraft computer design and interaction,"" she says. Follow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook. Copyright 2025 BBC.

2025-06-04,Article,Why Labour is strengthening ties with China after years of rollercoaster relations,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c071jr159p0o,"Listen to Ankur read this article The sprawling city of Chongqing in southwestern China is an incredible sight. Built on mountainous terrain and crisscrossed by rivers, it is connected by vast elevated roads. Trains even run through some buildings. TikTokers have begun documenting their commutes in the striking urban architecture, generating millions of likes and much hype.  But it is also where, on a somewhat quieter trip, mayors and their deputies from the UK recently visited - the largest British civic delegation to go there in history. The whole trip, which took place in March, received substantial Chinese media coverage, despite flying more under the radar in the UK. The impression it left on some of the politicians who travelled there was vast. ""[The city is] what happens if you take the planning department and just say 'yes' to everything,"" reflects Howard Dawber, deputy London mayor for business. ""It's just amazing."" The group travelled to southern Chinese cities, spoke to Chinese mayors and met Chinese tech giants. So impressed was one deputy mayor that, on returning home, they bought a mobile phone from Chinese brand Honor (a stark contrast from the days the UK banned Huawei technology from its 5G networks, just a few years ago). Roughly half-a-dozen deals were signed on the back of the trip. The West Midlands, for example, agreed to establish a new UK headquarters in Birmingham for Chinese energy company EcoFlow.  But the visit was as much about diplomacy as it was trade, says East Midlands deputy mayor Nadine Peatfield, who attended. ""There was a real hunger and appetite to rekindle those relationships."" To some, it was reminiscent of the ""golden era"" of UK-China relations, a time when then-Prime Minister David Cameron and Chinese President Xi Jinping shared a basket of fish and chips and a pint. Those days have long felt far away. Political ties with China deteriorated under former UK Conservative Prime Ministers Boris Johnson, Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss. The last UK prime minister to visit China was Theresa May, in 2018.  The recent delegation - and the talk of Sir Keir Starmer possibly visiting China later this year -  all suggests a turning point in relations. But to what greater intent? The course correction seemed to begin with the closed-door meeting between Sir Keir and Chinese President Xi in Brazil last November. The prime minister signalled that Britain would look to cooperate with China on climate change and business. Since then, Labour's cautious pursuit of China has primarily focused on the potential financial upsides.  In January, Chancellor Rachel Reeves co-chaired the first UK-China economic summit since 2019, in Beijing. Defending her trip, she said: ""Choosing not to engage with China is no choice at all."" Reeves claimed re-engagement with China could boost the UK economy by £1bn, with agreements worth £600m to the UK over the next five years — partially achieved through lifting barriers that restrict exports to China. Soon after, Energy Secretary Ed Miliband resumed formal climate talks with China. Miliband said it would be ""negligence"" to future generations not to have dialogue with the country, given it is the world's biggest carbon emitter. Labour simply describes its approach as ""grown-up"". But it all appears to be a marked shift from the last decade of UK-China relations. During the so-called ""golden era"", from 2010, the UK's policy towards China was dominated by the Treasury, focusing on economic opportunities and appearing to cast almost all other issues, including human rights or security, aside.  By September 2023, however, Rishi Sunak said he was ""acutely aware of the particular threat to our open and democratic way of life"" posed by China. Labour claimed in its manifesto that it would bring a ""long-term and strategic approach"". China has a near monopoly on extracting and refining rare earth minerals, which are critical to manufacturing many high-tech and green products. For example, car batteries are often reliant on lithium, while indium is a rare metal used for touch screens. This makes China a vital link in global supply chains. ""China's influence is likely to continue to grow substantially globally, especially with the US starting to turn inwards,"" says Dr William Matthews, a China specialist at Chatham House think tank. ""The world will become more Chinese, and whilst that is difficult for any Western government, there needs to be sensible engagement from the get-go.""  Andrew Cainey, a director of the UK National Committee on China, an educational non-profit organisation, says: ""China has changed a lot since the Covid-19 pandemic. To have elected officials not having seen it, it's a no brainer for them to get back on the ground"". Certainly many in the UK's China-watching community believe that contact is an essential condition to gain a clearer-eyed view of the opportunities posed by China, but also the challenges. The opportunities, some experts say, are largely economic, climate and education-related. Or as Kerry Brown, Professor of Chinese Studies at King's College London, puts it: ""China is producing information, analysis and ways of doing things that we can learn from"". He points to the intellectual, technological, AI, and life sciences opportunities. Not engaging with China would be to ignore the realities of geopolitics in the 21st century, in Dr Matthew's view, given that it is the world's second largest economy. However he also believes that engagement comes with certain risks. Charles Parton, who spent 22 years of his diplomatic career working in or on China, raises questions about the UK's economic and national security. For example, the government is reportedly weighing up proposals for a Chinese company to supply wind turbines for an offshore windfarm in the North Sea. Mr Parton warns against allowing China access to the national grid: ""It wouldn't be difficult in a time of high tension to say, 'by the way, we can turn off all your wind farms'"". But earlier this year, the China Chamber of Commerce to the EU issued a statement expressing concern over the ""politicisation"" of deals between wind developers in Europe and Chinese turbine suppliers. James Sullivan, director of Cyber and Tech at defence think tank Rusi, notes there are also some questions around cyberspace. ""China's activities in cyberspace appear to be more strategically and politically focused compared to previous opportunistic activities,"" he says. As for defence, the UK's recently published defence review describes China as a ""sophisticated and persistent challenge"", with Chinese technology and its proliferation to other countries ""already a leading challenge for the UK"". Ken McCallum, MI5 director general, meanwhile, has previously warned of a sustained campaign on an ""epic scale"" of Chinese espionage abroad. But Prof Brown pushes back on some concerns about espionage, saying some media narratives about this are a ""fairytale"". Beijing has always dismissed accusations of espionage as attempts to ""smear"" China. Sir Keir and his team will no doubt be closely monitoring how this is all viewed by Washington DC. Last month, President Donald Trump's trade advisor Peter Navarro described Britain as ""an all too compliant servant of Communist China"", urging the UK against deepening economic ties. ""When it comes to foreign policy towards China, America's influence on policy will be quite substantive compared with say continental Europe,"" says Dr Yu Jie, senior research fellow on China at Chatham House think tank. Most analysts I speak to in both the UK and China are still clear on the need for the two countries to get back in the same room, even if they differ on where to draw the line: in which areas should Westminster cooperate and where should it stay clear. These red lines have not yet been drawn, and experts say that without some kind of playbook, it is difficult for businesses and elected officials to know how to engage. ""You can only keep firefighting specific issues for so long without developing a systematic plan,"" warns Mr Cainey. Certain thorny issues have arisen, including Chinese investments in the UK. For example in April when the government seized control of British Steel from its former Chinese owner Jingye, to prevent it from being closed down, Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds admitted that he would ""look at a Chinese firm in a different way"" when considering investment in the UK steel industry. China's foreign ministry spokesperson, Lin Jian, warned that Labour should avoid ""linking it to security issues, so as not to impact the confidence of Chinese enterprises in going to the UK"". After Starmer met Xi last year, he said the government's approach would be ""rooted in the national interests of the UK"", but acknowledged areas of disagreement with China, including on human rights, Taiwan and Russia's war in Ukraine. Securing the release of pro-democracy activist and British citizen Jimmy Lai from a Hong Kong prison is, he has said, a ""priority"" for the government.  Labour's manifesto broadly pledged: ""We will cooperate where we can, compete where we need to, and challenge where we must."" What is still lacking, however, is the fine print. Asked about the British government's longer-term strategy, Mr Parton replied: ""No.10 doesn't have a strategy."" He tells me he has some specific advice: ""Go with your eyes open,"" he says. ""But have a clear idea of what needs protecting, and a willingness to take some short-term financial hits to protect long-term national security."" Labour has suggested that some clarity on their approach will be provided through the delayed China ""audit"", a cross-government exercise launched last year, which will review the UK's relations with China. The audit is due to be published this month, but many doubt that it will resolve matters. ""If we see a visit from Starmer to Beijing, that will be an indication that the two sides have actually agreed with something, and that they would like to change and improve their bilateral relationship,"" says Dr Yu. But many people in Westminster remain China-sceptic. And even if the audit helps Britain better define what it wants out of its relationship with China, the question remains, do MPs and businesses have the China-related expertise to get the best out of it? According to Ruby Osman, China analyst at the Tony Blair Institute, there is an urgent need to build the UK's China capabilities in a more holistic way, focusing on diversifying the UK's points of contact with China. ""If we want to be in a position where we are not just listening to what Beijing and Washington want, there needs to be investment in the talent pipeline coming into government, but also think tanks and businesses who work with China,"" she argues. And if that's the case, then irrespective of whether closer ties with China is viewed as a security threat, an economic opportunity, or something in between, the UK might be in a better position to engage with the country.

They thought he had been working in construction and had not heard from him since he left Bobete in 2022. Ms Khoaisanyane says that during the phone call, they were told that what caused the deaths of most of those underground in Stilfontein was a lack of food and water. Many of the more than 240 who were rescued came out very ill. Stilfontein made global headlines late last year when the police implemented a controversial new strategy to crack down on illegal mining. They restricted the flow of food and water into the mine in an attempt to ""smoke out"" the workers, as one South African minister put it. In January, a court order forced the government to launch a rescue operation. Supang's family say they understand what he was doing was illegal but they disagree with how the authorities dealt with the situation. ""They tortured these people with hunger, not allowing food and medication to be sent down. It makes us really sad that he was down there without food for that long. We believe this is what ended his life,"" his aunt says. The dead miner's family have finally received his body and buried him near his  half-finished home. But Tiger's mother and brother are still waiting for news about him. The South African police say the search continues, though it is not clear if they have got any closer to finding him.

2025-06-04,Article,Kenyan author prosecuted for writing a book about president's daughter,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgnrlp6vgzo,"Kenyan free-speech advocates and lawyers have condemned the prosecution of the author of an unauthorised biography of Kenyan President William Ruto's daughter. Charlene Ruto accused Webster Ochora Elijah of ""misusing"" her name by writing the book without first seeking permission from her. On Tuesday, the author was arrested and charged with impersonation over the book titled Beyond the Name: Charlene Ruto and the Youth Uprising. He pleaded not guilty and was released on bail. Ms Ruto told journalists that she had reported the matter to the police and was following legal procedures. She is listed as the complainant on the charge sheet. The charge alleges that the accused published the book on or before 22 May, alongside others who are yet to be charged, with intention to defraud. The president's daughter has not complained about the contents of the book, just that it was written without her permission. But critics say this is not illegal. Politician and lawyer Willis Otieno said to ""criminalise authorship"" was misusing the ""state machinery in defence of fragile egos"". Literary critic Mbugua Ngunjiri said the author did ""nothing wrong"", giving an example of an unauthorised biography of former President Uhuru Kenyatta, in 2014, where the ""author did not need to consult"". ""A million writers can write 'her book' and it will be perfectly legal. The only time Charlene would be justified to go after the author is if he misrepresented her in any way,"" he posted on Facebook. The president's daughter told journalists that there was a ""bad culture"" in Kenya ""where we misuse people's names and we get away with it and that is not right"".   She said the author had not sought permission from her and it did not matter whether the book was ""positive"" about her. ""The gentleman never came to me with a suggestion that he wants to write a book on my behalf and for me that is a misappropriate use of my name,"" she said. The self-published book, by a little-known author, aged 25, has not been widely distributed and there is not much publicly available information about its contents. It is not available online. His legal team have argued that his work did not constitute a crime. Lawyer Kennedy Mong'are told local media that he had previously written books about public figures, including on veteran politician Raila Odinga and US President Donald Trump. Another lawyer, Evan Ondieki, said that high-ranking government figures should expect public scrutiny and that the arrest undermined Kenya's democratic values. ""You cannot be so thick-skinned that the use of your name or image becomes an offence,"" he stated. In April, a secondary school teacher was charged for impersonating another daughter of President Ruto, by pretending to be June Ruto on Facebook.  Charlene Ruto is a high-profile figure who has in the past been likened to a version of Ivanka Trump, daughter of the US president. She has often been a guest at public events, and in the past met leaders across the country and attended international forums. In 2022, she denied that public money was being used to fund what she called the ""Office of the First Daughter"". The court case has amplified concerns about restrictions on free expression, particularly following the recent detention of software developer Rose Njeri. Njeri was arrested on Friday for creating a tool that helped citizens oppose the government's annual finance bill. She was charged with cyber-crime and computer misuse on Tuesday and freed on bail until 20 June when the court will determine whether she will answer the charges. She has since thanked Kenyans for raising their voices against her ""ludicrous"" arrest and detention.

2025-06-04,Article,US Navy to rename ship honouring gay rights leader and veteran Harvey Milk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1w344zzn5wo,"The US Navy plans to remove the name of gay rights leader and Navy veteran Harvey Milk from one of its ships, and may change the titles of other vessels honouring civil rights leaders. The plans were outlined in documents obtained by BBC's US partner CBS News that show a timeline for when the renaming of USNS Harvey Milk would be shared with the public. It comes during Pride Month in June, an annual commemoration of the LGBT community that coincides with the anniversary of the Stonewall riots in 1969. The directive also comes amid a broader movement by the Trump administration to curb programmes that promote diversity and inclusion across federal departments. Sean Parnell, a spokesman for the Pentagon, told CBS on Tuesday that the renaming of the USNS Harvey Milk is to realign the US military with the Trump administration's goal of ""re-establishing the warrior culture"" in the armed forces. The memo calls for Navy Secretary John Phelan to select a new name for the fleet oiler. That name change would then be communicated to other senior US Navy officials after a legal review. It also outlines other vessels recommended for renaming, including the USNS Ruth Bader Ginsburg, named after the late liberal Supreme Court justice, and the USNS Harriet Tubman, named after the American slavery abolitionist. Harvey Milk is known for being the first openly gay man to be elected to public office in California, winning a seat on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors. He was assassinated 10 months after he was sworn in. The push to rename the USNS Harvey Milk comes after a directive issued by Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth earlier this year instructing US military personnel to stop hosting events tied to heritage or awareness months.  This directive banned resources and manpower from being used on events like Pride Month, Black History Month and Women's History Month, citing concerns that they would undermine unity in the military. US President Donald Trump also issued executive orders earlier this year that banned diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) in the government, and that made it official US policy to recognise two sexes, male and female. Supporters of DEI programmes say they address historical underrepresentation and discrimination against certain groups, including racial minorities, but critics say such initiatives are themselves discriminatory. The move to rename the Harvey Milk and other ships has been criticised by prominent Democrats, including former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi.  In a statement to CBS, Pelosi called the move a ""vindictive erasure of those who fought to break down barriers for all to chase the American dream"". Democratic Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer wrote on X on Tuesday that Hegseth ""should be ashamed of himself and reverse this immediately."" Copyright 2025 BBC.

2025-06-04,Article,TikTok blocks searches for extreme thinness 'skinnytok' hashtag,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gr6q6256do,"TikTok is preventing users searching for ""skinnytok"" - a hashtag which critics say directs people towards content which ""idolises extreme thinness."" Content associated with the hashtag includes videos showing people's work-out routines or what they eat in a day.  TikTok said it had ""blocked search results for #skinnytok since it has become linked to unhealthy weight loss content."" People using the hashtag will now be redirected to mental health support resources instead. Tom Quinn, from the eating disorder charity, Beat, welcomed the move saying ""skinnytok"" and related content could have ""devastating"" impacts on ""struggling"" people. However, he stressed there was more to do. ""We know that users will very often find workarounds to content blocks and there will still be damaging content which isn't shared under the ""skinnytok"" umbrella, which TikTok and other social media platforms must now address,"" he told BBC News. According to the US-based National Alliance for Eating Disorders, the skinnytok hashtag has more than half a million posts associated with it. It says the hashtag includes content such as low-calorie recipes which on the face of it appear to promote healthy lifestyle advice. But the organisation says, in reality, it ""glorifies thinness and vilifies weight gain"" and ""promotes disordered eating behaviours."" The  trend has caused particular alarm in France, where experts have warned of how social media can push vulnerable young people towards developing eating disorders. ""The patients are completely indoctrinated -- and my 45-minute weekly consultation is no match for spending hours every day on TikTok,"" the nutritionist Carole Copti told the AFP news agency. The blocking of the hashtag has been celebrated by France's digital minister, who wrote on social media that ""skinnytok is over"" thanks to lobbying by European politicians.  In its statement, TikTok said it regularly reviewed its safety measures to ""address evolving risks"". ""We continue to restrict videos from teen accounts and provide health experts and information in TikTok Search,"" it added. It is not the first time TikTok has been forced to take action over content which raised body image concerns. In March, it blocked so-called ""chubby filters"" - a viral tool which made people appear overweight. Sign up for our Tech Decoded newsletter to follow the world's top tech stories and trends.

2025-06-04,Article,South African politician sacked over visit to fugitive pastor,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c308r56rzdmo,"A top official in one of South Africa's biggest political parties has been sacked after he visited a controversial Malawian pastor in April. Floyd Shivambu has been removed as secretary-general of the uMkhonto weSizwe (MK) party barely six months into the job after he attended an Easter service at self-proclaimed pastor Shepherd Bushiri's church. Mr Bushiri, from Malawi, was one of southern Africa's best known preachers when he was arrested and charged with fraud in South Africa in 2020. After being released on bail, he managed to flee to his home country in unclear circumstances. South Africa has been trying to extradite him ever since. Mr Bushiri denies any wrongdoing and, together with his wife Mary, has applied to review a judgment that approved their extradition to South Africa, according to local news site Eyewitness News.  The MK party, which was founded by former President Jacob Zuma, said in a press conference on Wednesday that Mr Shivambu's removal came after his actions ""were found to be against the spirit and prescripts of the MK party's constitution"". ""The president and national officials were left with no other option but to act swiftly,"" said MK national chair Nathi Nhleko. He added that the trip ""was not an officially sanctioned programme of the organisation"". However, Mr Shivambu remains a member of the party and will instead represent MK in the National Assembly. Reacting to news of his demotion, Mr Shivambu said he ""fully accepts"" the decision taken by the party and looked forward to taking up his new role in parliament. Mr Shivambu joined the MK party in August last year from the rival Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) and was later appointed secretary-general - one of the party's top positions. Under the leadership of former President Zuma, the newly formed MK party came third in last year's elections - a major factor in the governing ANC losing its majority for the first time since democratic elections were introduced in 1994. Mr Shivambu was widely criticised in April when he reposted footage shared on X by Mr Bushiri showing the self-proclaimed pastor asking hundreds of worshippers at his Jesus Nation church to welcome the South African politician. The politician, in his retweet, also praised Mr Bushiri for his ""good work"" and ""for hosting us"".  Mr Bushiri is a millionaire who set up churches in several African countries. He is accused of preying on poor people who were desperate to improve their lives by selling merchandise including ""miracle oil"". The self-proclaimed prophet claims to have cured people of HIV, made the blind see, changed the fortunes of the impoverished and, on at least one occasion, walked on air. Mr Bushiri has also been charged with rape. He and his wife have denied any wrongdoing. Sanet Solomon, an analyst based at South Africa's University of the Free State, said Mr Shivambu's removal was ""expected"" given the negative publicity his visit to Malawi garnered. ""His removal does, however, raise questions and concerns around leadership retention and succession planning as the party is preparing to welcome its sixth secretary general in its second year of existence. These changes further exacerbate concerns around the party's stability,"" she told the BBC. Mr Shivambu has been the MK party's longest-serving secretary general since the party's formation in December 2023. Ms Solomon added that Shivambu's ""leadership style"" and ""tension with other party leaders"" were contributing factors in his ultimate downfall within the party. The internal conflict between Mr Shivambu and some MK party leaders played out publicly when Zuma's daughter, Duduzile, was forced to apologise after calling him ""useless"" and ""the worst thing that happened to MK"" in a post on X earlier this year. ""It would not be surprising if he [Shivambu] soon announces his departure from the party,"" Ms Solomon predicted.  Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

2025-06-03,Article,Dutch government faces collapse as far-right leader exits coalition,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0r1x5yyd5wo,"The Dutch government has collapsed after Geert Wilders withdrew his far-right party from the governing coalition following a row over migration. Prime Minister Dick Schoof confirmed he was stepping down on Tuesday and offered the resignation of the cabinet to King Willem-Alexander. In televised remarks following an emergency cabinet meeting, Schoof said Wilders' decision to withdraw the support of his PVV party was ""irresponsible and unnecessary"".  ""As far as I'm concerned, this shouldn't have happened,"" he added. The governing coalition was in place for less than one year. The row which led to its collapse came after Wilders pushed for 10 additional asylum measures, including a freeze on applications, halting the construction of reception centres and limiting family reunification. Schoof had made a last-minute appeal to coalition party leaders on Tuesday morning, but the meeting lasted just one minute before Wilders walked out, ending the coalition. ""No signature for our asylum plans. PVV leaves the coalition,"" said Wilders on X. There was shock and anger among political leaders, many of whom pointed out that several of Wilders' demands were similar to policies already in the coalition agreement, and that they would not stand in the PVV's way to implement them. Many of the additional proposals put forward by Wilders had been dismissed during coalition talks because of  legal concerns. Wilders' decision has put an end to an uneasy governing coalition which was born in July 2024 after months of political wrangling following elections the previous year. His anti-immigration, far-right PVV was the largest party. The other members were the conservative-liberal VVD, the Farmers' Citizen Movement (BBB) and the centrist New Social Contract. From the start the coalition seemed a marriage of convenience, characterised by infighting and appeared to struggle to push through any of policies it had proudly promoted.  Following its collapse, Wilders' former coalition partners accused him of engineering the crisis. VVD leader Dilan Yesilgoz said the move was ""super irresponsible"", adding: ""This wasn't about asylum at all."" ""I think Wilders is betraying the Netherlands,"" said deputy Prime Minister Mona Keijzer from the BBB.  But Wilders appears to feel emboldened. On Tuesday he told reporters that he intended to become prime minister of the Netherlands ""and ensure that the PVV becomes bigger than ever in the next elections"". Sandra Phlippen, the chief economist for ABN AMRO bank, said the immediate economic impact of the cabinet's collapse appeared minimal because during its 11 months in office the government had ""barely made any concrete plans"".  Polls show the far right and Green-Left parties are neck-and-neck, with migration and cost-of-living issues fuelling political volatility across Europe.   Wilders wanted the government to collapse as the support for his Freedom Party continues to drop in the polls, according to Armida van Rij, the Head of the Europe Programme at Chatham House. With the Nato summit due to be held in the Hague at the end of the month, Schoof's ministers will seek to remain in power in a caretaker capacity until a date is set for the Netherlands to return to the polls - likely in the autumn, according to Dutch media. In the Dutch political system, becoming prime minister requires forming a majority coalition in the 150-seat parliament. Even if Wilders again surpasses the political pundits expectations, his decision to collapse the government is being seen as reckless - and perceptions he is putting personal ambition above national stability could further complicate his ability to form alliances after the next election.  The parties that were reluctant or refused to go into government with Wilders after the last election are likely to find that kind of partnership even less attractive now.  In addition, by toppling the coalition over the issue of asylum, it is likely Wilders will put it at the centre of his upcoming election campaign. However, given that his party had been responsible for asylum and immigration for almost a year, there are no guarantees that such a gamble will pay off. Copyright 2025 BBC.

2025-06-03,Article,Blake Lively drops two claims against Justin Baldoni,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62v5g81857o,"The actress Blake Lively has attempted to withdraw two of the claims she made about director Justin Baldoni. Both have been engaged in a legal dispute since Lively sued Baldoni in December 2024 after they worked together on the film It Ends With Us, accusing him of sexual harassment and a smear campaign. Baldoni's legal team asked Lively to release her medical records, including therapy notes, as part of its defence against her claims she suffered ""severe emotional distress and pain, humiliation, embarrassment"", Variety said.  Lively is trying to drop claims of intentional infliction of emotional distress and negligent infliction of emotional distress, the publication added.  The court will decide if it will dismiss the claims or compel Lively to hand over information related to her mental health. Variety approached Baldoni's lawyers, who have declined comment.  The BBC has also approached both parties for comment.  Documents filed by Baldoni's legal team on Monday said: ""Instead of complying with the Medical RFPs [Request for Proposal], Ms Lively's counsel recently advised us, in writing, that Ms Lively is withdrawing her [infliction of emotional distress] claims."" They wrote that Lively had refused their ""reasonable request that the withdrawal of such claims be with prejudice"" opening up the possibility they could be refiled.  Lively's lawyers told Variety Baldoni's filing was ""a press stunt"" and said her defence was ""streamlining and focusing"" her case. They added: ""The Baldoni-Wayfarer strategy of filing retaliatory claims has exposed them to expansive new damages claims under California law, rendering certain of Ms Lively's original claims no longer necessary.  ""Ms Lively continues to allege emotional distress, as part of numerous other claims in her lawsuit, such as sexual harassment and retaliation, and massive additional compensatory damages on all of her claims."" In January this year, Baldoni counter-sued Lively and her husband, the actor Ryan Reynolds, on claims of civil extortion, defamation and invasion of privacy. Lively and Baldoni have been locked in a dispute since It Ends With Us, which is an adaption of a best-selling Colleen Hoover novel, was released last summer. In the film Lively played the main character, Lily Bloom, a young woman who grew up witnessing domestic abuse, and winds up in the same position years later. The singer Taylor Swift had been summoned to a US court last month, after it was alleged she encouraged Baldoni to accept script rewrites by Lively. Representatives for Swift said at the time ""she was not involved in any casting or creative decision"" and ""never saw an edit or made any notes on the film"". The subpoena was dropped about two weeks later, after Swift's legal team objected that the legal order amounted to an ""unwarranted fishing expedition"", Variety said. Copyright 2025 BBC.

2025-06-03,Article,Major new Madeleine McCann search under way in Portugal,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy4k1vg34wlo,"Portuguese and German authorities have begun a new search for Madeleine McCann in Portugal, nearly two decades after she disappeared. Madeleine was three when she vanished from an apartment complex in Praia da Luz in the Algarve on 3 May 2007, sparking a Europe-wide police investigation that has become one of the highest-profile missing persons cases. Portuguese police said on Monday they were carrying out warrants from German prosecutors to search 21 plots of land between where Madeleine went missing and where the German investigators' prime suspect had been staying at the time. Tuesday's search appears to have focused on an abandoned building, where officers were seen digging and clearing rocks. The search - which covers the municipality of Lagos, near Praia da Luz - is due to continue until Friday. On Tuesday morning, a Portuguese fire engine and four vehicles carrying German police arrived at the search site - located around 3.5 miles from the Ocean Club resort, where Madeleine and her family had been staying. Roads leading up to the site - which is large and mostly scrubland - have been closed since Monday, where the team has been clearing grass and vegetation. The day's efforts appear to centre on disused buildings near the coast. The team has also examined wells, while firefighters have drained one particular well. Around 30 German officers are expected to take part in the search.  Charlie Hedges, the former missing children chief at the National Crime Agency (NCA), who has worked on some of the UK's highest-profile cases, said it appeared investigators were ""casting the net a bit wider"" with the latest search. ""It seems a bit widespread to be [that] they're looking for something particular,"" he told the BBC. ""If it was a firm lead, you'd have thought it would be defined and towards one place."" However, he said they must have had enough justification to acquire the search warrants. ""They'd need to get approval for funding from Germany, and it should be quite a considerable cost with the number of resources and working abroad and the rest of it."" Madeleine's case was initially handled by the Portuguese authorities with the aid of the Metropolitan Police.  German investigators have taken a lead since 2020, when they identified German national Christian Brückner as their prime suspect. The 48-year-old is currently serving a sentence in Germany for the rape of a 72-year-old American tourist in Portugal in 2005. He was due to be released in September, but that could be pushed back to early 2026 if he does not pay a fine he owes.  German authorities fear that if Brückner is not charged with anything, he will disappear following his release.  German police suspect him of murder. British police continue to treat the case as a missing persons investigation. Brückner has repeatedly denied any involvement and no charges have been brought against him relating to her disappearance.  Portuguese authorities have also named Brückner as a formal suspect, or ""arguido"". They said they will hand over any evidence seized in the latest search to German authorities. The Met Police, which said this week that it was aware of the searches being carried out by German police in Portugal, continues its investigation into Madeleine's disappearance. The case, known as Operation Grange, has been ongoing since 2011 and has cost around £13.3m to date. Officials have not disclosed if they are conducting this latest search in Portugal based on any new information, making it appear as if they are taking one last look in places where evidence or a body could have been hidden. German police have a European warrant, which has been approved by Portuguese prosecutors, to allow them to conduct searches on private land.  The last search took place two years ago and was focused around a reservoir to the north-east of where Madeleine was staying. Brückner, who spent time in the area between 2000 and 2017, was found to have photographs and videos of himself near the reservoir. Mr Hedges said the latest search area could be ""a gap they're trying to plug"". He suggested Brückner's impending release was ""probably driving things"" and police needed to ""nail down"" further evidence. Jim Gamble, founding chief executive of the Child Exploitation and Online Protection unit of the NCA, said a review of the case he led in 2010 had ""identified areas that should have been searched and could have been searched that weren't"". He told the BBC that mistakes in the original investigation had ""created a legacy of chaos that undermined the investigation for many years"", requiring new searches to  cover old ground. Mr Gamble added that, 18 years on, investigators would be using new forensic techniques, including equipment that can scan below the surface of the earth. On the night Madeleine disappeared, her parents had been at dinner with friends at a restaurant a short walk away while their three-year-old daughter and her younger twin siblings were asleep in the ground-floor apartment. Her mother, Kate, discovered she was missing at around 22:00. A German documentary in 2022 found evidence that Brückner occasionally worked at the Ocean Club as a handyman, while German prosecutors have also linked his mobile phone data and a car sale to their case against him. Last month, Madeleine's parents marked the 18th year anniversary of her disappearance, saying their ""determination to leave no stone unturned is unwavering"".

2025-06-03,Article,Blake Lively drops two claims against Justin Baldoni,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62v5g81857o,"The actress Blake Lively has attempted to withdraw two of the claims she made about director Justin Baldoni. Both have been engaged in a legal dispute since Lively sued Baldoni in December 2024 after they worked together on the film It Ends With Us, accusing him of sexual harassment and a smear campaign. Baldoni's legal team asked Lively to release her medical records, including therapy notes, as part of its defence against her claims she suffered ""severe emotional distress and pain, humiliation, embarrassment"", Variety said.  Lively is trying to drop claims of intentional infliction of emotional distress and negligent infliction of emotional distress, the publication added.  The court will decide if it will dismiss the claims or compel Lively to hand over information related to her mental health. Variety approached Baldoni's lawyers, who have declined comment.  The BBC has also approached both parties for comment.  Documents filed by Baldoni's legal team on Monday said: ""Instead of complying with the Medical RFPs [Request for Proposal], Ms Lively's counsel recently advised us, in writing, that Ms Lively is withdrawing her [infliction of emotional distress] claims."" They wrote that Lively had refused their ""reasonable request that the withdrawal of such claims be with prejudice"" opening up the possibility they could be refiled.  Lively's lawyers told Variety Baldoni's filing was ""a press stunt"" and said her defence was ""streamlining and focusing"" her case. They added: ""The Baldoni-Wayfarer strategy of filing retaliatory claims has exposed them to expansive new damages claims under California law, rendering certain of Ms Lively's original claims no longer necessary.  ""Ms Lively continues to allege emotional distress, as part of numerous other claims in her lawsuit, such as sexual harassment and retaliation, and massive additional compensatory damages on all of her claims."" In January this year, Baldoni counter-sued Lively and her husband, the actor Ryan Reynolds, on claims of civil extortion, defamation and invasion of privacy. Lively and Baldoni have been locked in a dispute since It Ends With Us, which is an adaption of a best-selling Colleen Hoover novel, was released last summer. In the film Lively played the main character, Lily Bloom, a young woman who grew up witnessing domestic abuse, and winds up in the same position years later. The singer Taylor Swift had been summoned to a US court last month, after it was alleged she encouraged Baldoni to accept script rewrites by Lively. Representatives for Swift said at the time ""she was not involved in any casting or creative decision"" and ""never saw an edit or made any notes on the film"". The subpoena was dropped about two weeks later, after Swift's legal team objected that the legal order amounted to an ""unwarranted fishing expedition"", Variety said. Copyright 2025 BBC.

2025-06-03,Article,A timeline of Madeleine McCann's disappearance as new search begins,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2lkwzp0r81o,"Three-year-old Madeleine McCann vanished from a Portuguese holiday apartment 18 years ago. In the intervening years, a huge, costly police operation has taken place across much of Europe and Madeleine has became one of the most high profile missing people.  Madeleine's parents, Kate and Gerry, say all they have ever wanted is to find their daughter. Now German police investigating her disappearance are holding fresh searches in Portugal.  On 3 May Madeleine, from Rothley, Leicestershire, is on holiday with her family at the Ocean Club in Praia da Luz, Portugal. On 12 May, the McCanns say they ""cannot describe the anguish and despair"" they are feeling. Portuguese police say they believe Madeleine was abducted but is still alive and in Portugal. On 26 May, police issue a description of a man seen on the night of Madeleine's disappearance, possibly carrying a child. In June, a Portuguese police chief admits vital forensic clues may have been destroyed as the scene was not protected properly. In July, British police send sniffer dogs to assist the investigation, and inspections of the McCann's apartment and rental car are conducted. By August it is 100 days since Madeleine disappeared. Investigating officers publicly acknowledge she may not be found alive. On 6 September, Portuguese police interview Kate McCann as a witness. On 7 September, detectives make the couple ""arguidos"" and days later, the McCanns return to the UK. Prosecutors later say there is no new evidence to justify re-questioning them. Gerry McCann releases a video in November saying he believes his family was watched by ""a predator"" in the days before his daughter's disappearance. On 20 January the McCanns release sketches of a suspect, based on a description by a British holidaymaker of a ""creepy man"" seen at the resort. In April, Portuguese police fly to the UK to sit in on interviews conducted by Leicestershire Police of the McCanns' friends they had dinner with on the night Madeleine disappeared. On 3 May, one year since the disappearance, Kate McCann urges people to ""pray like mad"" for her little girl. By July Portuguese police say they have submitted their final report on the case. Weeks later, authorities shelve their investigation and lift the ""arguido"" status of the McCanns. On 3 November, new images of how Madeleine might now look are released. In March 2010, the McCanns criticise the release of previously unseen Portuguese police files - detailing possible sightings of Madeleine - to British newspapers. A month later, in April, Gerry McCann says it is ""incredibly frustrating"" that police in Portugal and the UK had not been actively looking for his daughter ""for a very long time"". In November, the couple sign a publishing deal to write a book about Madeleine's disappearance. The McCanns' book, Madeleine, is released in May. Prime Minister David Cameron asks the Metropolitan Police to help investigate. A two-year review follows. Det Ch Insp Andy Redwood, the detective leading the UK review of Madeleine's disappearance, tells an April broadcast of the BBC's Panorama his team is ""seeking to bring closure to the case"". A computer-generated image of what Madeleine might look like aged nine is released, a day before Portuguese authorities say they are not reopening their investigation. In May, UK detectives reviewing the case say they have identified ""a number of persons of interest"". By July, Scotland Yard announces it has ""new evidence and new witnesses"" in the case and opens a formal investigation. By October, Scotland Yard detectives say they have identified 41 potential suspects. A BBC Crimewatch appeal features e-fit images of a man seen carrying a blond-haired child of three or four in Praia da Luz at about the time Madeleine went missing. Portuguese police reopen their investigation - to run alongside Scotland Yard's - citing ""new lines of inquiry"". In January British detectives fly to Portugal amid claims they are planning to make arrests. In June searches in Praia da Luz are carried out, including an area of scrubland situated south-west of the Ocean Club complex. It yields nothing of interest. A month later, in July, four suspects are quizzed by police but no new developments emerge. In September 2015 the British government disclose that the investigation has cost more than £10m. In April 2017 the four official suspects investigated by police are ruled out of the investigation but senior officers say they are pursuing a ""significant line of inquiry"". In June 2019 the UK government says it will fund the Met Police inquiry, which began in 2011, until March 2020. A year later, in June 2020, police reveal that a 43-year-old German prisoner - named by German media as Christian B - has been identified as a suspect. The McCanns thank police, saying: ""All we have ever wanted is to find her, uncover the truth and bring those responsible to justice. ""We will never give up hope of finding Madeleine alive, but whatever the outcome may be, we need to know as we need to find peace."" German investigators have classed it as a murder inquiry and say they are assuming that Madeleine is dead. The UK's Metropolitan Police says it has received more than 270 calls and emails since a new appeal for information was launched on Wednesday. In April 2022, a German man is declared an official suspect by Portuguese prosecutors investigating the case. Christian Brückner, then 45, is made an ""arguido"", although Portuguese authorities do not formally reveal the suspect's name. The McCann family mark the 16th anniversary of Madeleine's disappearance on 3 May 2023, saying she is ""still very much missed"" and they ""await a breakthrough"". Later that month, a Portuguese news website reports that an area near a reservoir, about 30 miles (48km) from Praia da Luz, had been being sealed off. Police say they will begin searching the Arade dam on 23 May, but the search ends after three days.  In October, Portuguese police apologise to the McCanns saying the investigation into Madeleine's disappearance was not handled properly, there was insufficient importance given at the time to missing children and that her parents' position as foreigners in an environment they did not understand was not appreciated. In April, the UK government approved more than £100,000 in additional funding for Scotland Yard detectives investigating Madeleine's disappearance.  A month later in May, the McCann family marked 18 years since her disappearance, saying their ""determination to leave no stone unturned is unwavering"". In the same month, it emerged chief suspect in Madeleine's disappearance Christian Brückner - who is serving a sentence for a sexually assaulting an elderly American woman in Praia da Luz in 2005 - is set to be released from prison in Germany later than originally scheduled according to his lawyer. He is due to be released in September or, if he does not pay a fine, early 2026.  On 3 June, fresh searches led by German police start in Portugal, between Praia da Luz and Lagos. The areas being searched are close to a ramshackle dwelling where Brückner lived at the time of Madeleine's disappearance. Copyright 2025 BBC.

2025-06-03,Article,Why monsoon rains wreak havoc annually in India's cities,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr7zlm3mpejo,"""Who is responsible for this mess?"" The question recently echoed across India's financial capital Mumbai as thousands of residents once again found themselves stranded, soaked and frustrated. Heavy rains brought the city to a standstill, and this was before the monsoon had even begun in full swing. Roads turned into rivers, vehicles broke down mid-commute and low-lying neighbourhoods were waterlogged within hours.  Even a newly-built underground metro station could not withstand the heavy downpour as photos and videos of the station flooded with muddy water went viral.  The pre-monsoon deluge once again exposed the city's fragile infrastructure and sparked widespread outrage on social media. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), one of India's richest civic organisations responsible for maintaining Mumbai's infrastructure, initially blamed the problem on rubbish clogging the drains and debris from metro construction, The Hindustan Times newspaper reported. Following criticism, the BMC installed de-watering pumps in flood-prone areas and began manually clearing waste from drains to prevent further waterlogging. But for many residents, the action came too late. The crisis is neither new - nor is it unique to Mumbai. From Delhi in the north to Bengaluru in the south, India's biggest cities flood every monsoon season. Roads collapse, drains overflow, infrastructure is overwhelmed and traffic grinds to a halt. Experts blame rapid unplanned urbanisation, poor infrastructure and years of environmental neglect as the root causes of this problem.  ""The pace of urban expansion has far exceeded the evolution of supporting infrastructure, particularly in water and drainage systems,"" says Dikshu Kukreja, an architect and urban planner based in Delhi. ""Many cities rely on outdated systems designed decades ago. And in the process of unchecked expansion, natural drainage channels, wetlands and water bodies that once absorbed excess rainwater have been built over or neglected,"" he adds. Experts say there's no one-size-fits-all solution as each city faces unique challenges and factors such as geography, population and climate must be considered when designing effective responses. India receives 80% of its annual rainfall during the monsoon season, which usually starts from June and continues until September. The monsoon is crucial for agriculture and the livelihoods of millions of Indian farmers. They rely on seasonal showers in parts of the country where proper irrigation channels are absent. But experts say climate change has made erratic weather - such as unseasonal rains, flash floods and droughts linked to extreme heat - a more regular phenomenon, directly affecting millions of people. This year the monsoon arrived a week early in parts of southern India, catching authorities unprepared.  ""A depression developed over the eastern central Arabian Sea which was instrumental in pulling up the monsoon current,"" says Mahesh Palawat, vice-president of meteorology and climate change at weather forecasting company Skymet.  In Delhi, the Minto bridge has become a symbol of the city's annual monsoon chaos. Almost every year, after heavy rain, a bus or lorry gets stuck under the bridge - an image that highlights the city's struggle with urban flooding. This year, Delhi recorded its wettest May since 1901, with more than 185mm of rainfall, according to the Indian weather department.  Many residents reported damage to their property.  At least four people were killed and dozens more were injured in one of the two heavy storms that hit the city in May, according to media reports. Meanwhile, in Bengaluru, more than 2,000kms (1,240 miles) from the capital, the problem looks different but its root cause is the same.  Once known for its network of lakes that helped manage excess rainwater, Bengaluru has seen many of these water bodies encroached upon. In their place now stand apartment complexes, business hubs and roads - leaving the city vulnerable to flooding. ""Bengaluru is made up of three major valleys through which water naturally flows. Most of the city's lakes are located in these valleys,"" explains Ram Prasad, a lake conservation activist. These valleys were originally designated as no-construction zones but over the years, encroachment has taken place and later changes in the law permitted infrastructure projects to be built in the area, he says.  ""When you convert lakes - which traditionally act as flood buffers - into built-up areas, the water has nowhere to go. So, what we're seeing in Bengaluru today is the result of poor urban planning.""  Mr Prasad points out that Bengaluru, which sits atop a hill, was never meant to flood and the current situation is entirely man-made. Violations of building norms, especially construction that narrows stormwater drains or builds directly over them, have only made things worse, he says. Meanwhile, Mumbai faces natural challenges due to its geography. For example, many parts of Mumbai are low-lying and close to the sea, which makes them more vulnerable to flooding during heavy rains and high tides. But experts say it's human actions that have made things much worse: cutting down mangroves, which normally act like natural barriers against floods, and building on floodplains where water is supposed to drain. ""The breakdown is systemic - it begins with planning that often doesn't account for future climate variabilities, gets exacerbated by poor execution and is compounded by weak enforcement of regulations,"" Mr Kukerja says. ""Political will is often reactive - responding to disasters rather than investing in long-term resilience."" This isn't just a big city problem. Smaller towns often suffer equally, if not more.  Over the weekend, at least 30 people died in India's northeastern states after heavy rains triggered flooding and landslides. Tens of thousands have been affected, with rescue efforts under way.  So, can anything be done to prevent this? ""Yes,"" says Mr Kukreja, but only if it is part of a long-term, co-ordinated strategy. He suggests using mapping and real-time sensors to identify high-risk zones and alert communities. Predictive models can also help authorities plan better responses. ""But technology alone is not a fix, it needs to be paired with responsive governance and community involvement,"" he said. For India's cities to withstand the rains, they need more than just de-watering pumps and quick fixes. They need forward-thinking planning, before the damage is done.

2025-06-03,Article,The British jet engine that failed in the 'Valley of Death',https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y5zg85wnlo,"""It was going great until it fell apart."" Richard Varvill recalls the emotional shock that hits home when a high-tech venture goes off the rails. The former chief technology officer speaks ruefully about his long career trying to bring a revolutionary aerospace engine to fruition at UK firm Reaction Engines. The origins of Reaction Engines go back to the Hotol project in the 1980s. This was a futuristic space plane that caught the public imagination with the prospect of a British aircraft flying beyond the atmosphere. The secret sauce of Hotol was heat exchanger technology, an attempt to cool the super-heated 1,000C air that enters an engine at hypersonic speeds. Without cooling this will melt aluminium, and is, Mr Varvill says, ""literally too hot to handle"". Fast forward three decades to October 2024 and Reaction Engines was bringing the heat exchanger to life at sites in the UK and US. UK Ministry of Defence funding took the company into hypersonic research with Rolls-Royce for an unmanned aircraft. But that was not enough to keep the business afloat. Rolls-Royce declines to go into details about Reaction's collapse, but Mr Varvill is more specific. ""Rolls-Royce said it had other priorities and the UK military has very little money."" Aviation is a business with a very long gestation time for a product. It can take 20 years to develop an aircraft. This unforgiving journey is known as crossing the Valley of Death. Mr Varvill knew the business had to raise more funds towards the end of 2024 but big investors  were reluctant to jump on board. ""The game was being played right to the very end, but to cross the Valley of Death in aerospace is very hard."" What was the atmosphere like in those last days as the administrators moved in? ""It was pretty grim, we were all called into the lecture theatre and the managing director gave a speech about how the board 'had tried everything'. Then came the unpleasant experience of handing over passes and getting personal items. It was definitely a bad day at the office."" This bad day was too much for some. ""A few people were in tears. A lot of them were shocked and upset because they'd hoped we could pull it off right up to the end."" It was galling for Mr Varvill ""because we were turning it around with an improved engine. Just as we were getting close to succeeding we failed. That's a uniquely British characteristic."" Did they follow the traditional path after a mass lay-off and head to the nearest pub? ""We had a very large party at my house. Otherwise it would have been pretty awful to have put all that effort into the company and not mark it in some way."" His former colleague Kathryn Evans headed up the space effort, the work around hypersonic flight for the Ministry of Defence and opportunities to apply the technology in any other commercial areas. When did she know the game was up? ""It's tricky to say when I knew it was going wrong, I was very hopeful to the end. While there was a lot of uncertainty there was a strong pipeline of opportunities."" She remembers the moment the axe fell and she joined 200 colleagues in the HQ's auditorium. ""It was the 31st of October, a Thursday, I knew it was bad news but when you're made redundant with immediate effect there's no time to think about it. We'd all been fighting right to the end so then my adrenalin crashed."" And those final hours were recorded. One of her colleagues brought in a Polaroid camera. Portrait photos were taken and stuck on a board with message expressing what Reaction Engines meant to individuals. What did Ms Evans write? ""I will very much miss working with brilliant minds in a kind, supportive culture."" Since then she's been reflecting ""on an unfinished mission and the technology's potential"". But her personal pride remains strong. ""It was British engineering at its best and it's important for people to hold their heads up high."" Her boss Adam Dissel, president of Reaction Engines, ran the US arm of the business. He laments the unsuccessful struggle to wrest more funds from big names in aerospace. ""The technology consistently worked and was fairly mature. But some of our strategic investors weren't excited enough to put more money in and that put others off."" The main investors were Boeing, BAE Systems and Roll-Royce. He feels they could have done more to give the wider investment community confidence in Reaction Engines. It would have avoided a lot of pain.  ""My team had put heart and soul into the company and we had a good cry. "" Did they really shed tears? ""Absolutely, I had my tears at our final meeting where we joined hands and stood up. I said 'We still did great, take a bow."" What lessons can we draw for other high-tech ventures? ""You definitely have no choice but to be optimistic,"" says Mr Dissel. The grim procedure of winding down the business took over as passwords and laptops were collected while servers were backed up in case ""some future incarnation of the business can be preserved"". The company had been going in various guises for 35 years. ""We didn't want it to go to rust. I expect the administrator will look for a buyer for the intellectual property assets,"" Mr Dissel adds. Other former employees also hold out for a phoenix rising from the ashes. But the Valley of Death looms large. ""Reaction Engines was playing at the very edge of what was possible. We were working for the fastest engines and highest temperatures. We bit off the hard job,"" says Mr Dissel. Despite all this Mr Varvill's own epitaph for the business overshadows technological milestones. ""We failed because we ran out of money."" Copyright 2025 BBC.

2025-06-03,Article,How Ukraine carried out daring 'Spider Web' attack on Russian bombers,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq69qnvj6nlo,"It was an attack of astonishing ingenuity – unprecedented, broad, and 18 months in the making. On 1 June more than 100 Ukrainian drones struck air bases deep inside Russia, targeting nuclear-capable long-range bombers. The scale of the operation dubbed ""Spider Web"" became clear almost as soon as it began, with explosions reported across several time zones all over Russia - as far north as Murmansk above the Arctic Circle, and as far east as Irkutsk, over 4,000km from Ukraine. The Russian Defence Ministry confirmed the attacks had occurred in five regions of Russia - Murmansk, Irkutsk, Ivanovo, Ryazan and Amur -  but stated planes had been damaged only in Murmansk and Irkutsk, while in other locations the attacks had been repelled. In photos released shortly after the attack, Vasyl Maliuk, the head of the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), can be seen looking at a satellite map of airfields in which the bases in the locations listed by Russia are clearly identifiable. Maliuk said the drones were first smuggled into Russia, then placed inside wooden cabins mounted on the back of lorries and concealed below remotely operated detachable roofs. The lorries were then apparently driven to locations near airbases by drivers who were seemingly unaware of their cargo; then, the drones were launched and set upon their targets. Videos circulating online show drones emerging from the roof of one of the vehicles involved. One lorry driver interviewed by Russian state outlet Ria Novosti said he and other drivers tried to knock down drones flying out of a lorry with rocks. ""They were in the back of the truck and we threw stones to keep them from flying up, to keep them pinned down,"" he said. According to unverified reports by Russian Telegram channel Baza – which is known for its links to the security services – the drivers of the lorries from which the drones took off all told similar stories of being booked by businessmen to deliver wooden cabins in various locations around Russia. Some of them said they then received further instructions over the phone on where to park the lorries; when they did so, they were stunned to see drones fly out of them.  In a triumphant post shared on social media on Sunday night, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky – who directly supervised the operation - said 117 drones had been used in the daring attack that took ""one year, six months and nine days"" to prepare.  He also said one of the targeted locations was right next to one of the offices of the FSB Russian security services.  Russia has said it has detained people in connection with the attack, although Zelensky stated the people who had helped facilitate the operation ""were withdrawn from Russian territory... they are now safe"". In a now-deleted Telegram post, local authorities from the city of Ust-Kut in the Irkutsk region said they were looking for a Ukrainian-born 37-year-old in connection with the drone attack on the Belaya military airfield. Images shared by the SBU show dozens of small black drones neatly stashed in wooden cabins inside a warehouse, which Russian military bloggers pinpointed to a location in Chelyabinsk. Dr Steve Wright, a UK-based drone expert, told the BBC the drones used to hit Russian aircraft were simple quadcopters carrying relatively heavy payloads. He added that what made this attack ""quite extraordinary"" was the ability to smuggle them into Russia and then launch and command them remotely – which he concluded had been achieved through a link relayed through a satellite or the internet. Zelensky said each of the 117 drones launched had its own pilot.  Dr Wright also suggested it was likely the drones were able to fly in using GPS but may have also overcome localised Russian jamming measures by manually piloting drones remotely. Kyiv has not shared details on the origin of the drones, but since the start of the war Ukraine has become extremely efficient at manufacturing them – and it is possible the ones used in this operation were produced at home.  ""Russia has had very tangible losses, and justifiably so,"" said Zelensky in his nightly video address. According to Ukraine, 41 strategic bombers were hit and ""at least"" 13 destroyed. Moscow has not confirmed any losses of aircraft beyond saying some planes had been damaged. Videos verified by the BBC show damaged aircraft at the Olenegorsk air base in Murmansk and the Belaya air base in Irkutsk.  The strategic missile-carrying bombers targeted in the attack are thought to be – among others - the Tu-95, Tu-22 and Tu-160. Repairing them will be difficult and, because none are still in production, replacing them is impossible. Radar satellite imagery shared by Capella Space reveals at least four badly damaged or destroyed Russian long-range bombers at Belaya airbase. This matches Ukrainian drone footage also showing an attack on a Tu-95 bomber. ""According to the laws and customs of war, we have worked out absolutely legitimate targets – military airfields and aircraft that bomb our peaceful cities,"" said SBU head Vasyl Malyuk.  Tu-95 bombers are said to have launched a large-scale Kh-101 missile attack on Ukraine as recently as last week. Each bomber can carry eight guided cruise missiles and each missile itself carries a 400kg (882lb) warhead. A-50 military spy planes were also reportedly targeted. They are valuable aircraft that boost Russia's ability to both intercept Ukrainian missiles and to launch its own strikes.  It is not known how many A-50s Russia has - but in February 2024 military intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov put that number at eight, so any loss or damage could be a serious blow to Moscow. In a post on social media, the SBU said operation Spider Web cost Russia $7bn (£5.2bn). Russian state media stayed studiously quiet on the attacks, with primetime Sunday TV shows merely quoting statements by regional authorities. By Monday morning, the story had disappeared from the bulletins. On the internet and beyond Ukrainians celebrated, with one lauding the operation as ""titanic"". ""Of course, not everything can be revealed at this moment,"" Zelensky wrote on Telegram, ""but these are Ukrainian actions that will undoubtedly be in history books.""

2025-06-03,Article,Why monsoon rains wreak havoc annually in India's cities,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr7zlm3mpejo,"""Who is responsible for this mess?"" The question recently echoed across India's financial capital Mumbai as thousands of residents once again found themselves stranded, soaked and frustrated. Heavy rains brought the city to a standstill, and this was before the monsoon had even begun in full swing. Roads turned into rivers, vehicles broke down mid-commute and low-lying neighbourhoods were waterlogged within hours.  Even a newly-built underground metro station could not withstand the heavy downpour as photos and videos of the station flooded with muddy water went viral.  The pre-monsoon deluge once again exposed the city's fragile infrastructure and sparked widespread outrage on social media. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), one of India's richest civic organisations responsible for maintaining Mumbai's infrastructure, initially blamed the problem on rubbish clogging the drains and debris from metro construction, The Hindustan Times newspaper reported. Following criticism, the BMC installed de-watering pumps in flood-prone areas and began manually clearing waste from drains to prevent further waterlogging. But for many residents, the action came too late. The crisis is neither new - nor is it unique to Mumbai. From Delhi in the north to Bengaluru in the south, India's biggest cities flood every monsoon season. Roads collapse, drains overflow, infrastructure is overwhelmed and traffic grinds to a halt. Experts blame rapid unplanned urbanisation, poor infrastructure and years of environmental neglect as the root causes of this problem.  ""The pace of urban expansion has far exceeded the evolution of supporting infrastructure, particularly in water and drainage systems,"" says Dikshu Kukreja, an architect and urban planner based in Delhi. ""Many cities rely on outdated systems designed decades ago. And in the process of unchecked expansion, natural drainage channels, wetlands and water bodies that once absorbed excess rainwater have been built over or neglected,"" he adds. Experts say there's no one-size-fits-all solution as each city faces unique challenges and factors such as geography, population and climate must be considered when designing effective responses. India receives 80% of its annual rainfall during the monsoon season, which usually starts from June and continues until September. The monsoon is crucial for agriculture and the livelihoods of millions of Indian farmers. They rely on seasonal showers in parts of the country where proper irrigation channels are absent. But experts say climate change has made erratic weather - such as unseasonal rains, flash floods and droughts linked to extreme heat - a more regular phenomenon, directly affecting millions of people. This year the monsoon arrived a week early in parts of southern India, catching authorities unprepared.  ""A depression developed over the eastern central Arabian Sea which was instrumental in pulling up the monsoon current,"" says Mahesh Palawat, vice-president of meteorology and climate change at weather forecasting company Skymet.  In Delhi, the Minto bridge has become a symbol of the city's annual monsoon chaos. Almost every year, after heavy rain, a bus or lorry gets stuck under the bridge - an image that highlights the city's struggle with urban flooding. This year, Delhi recorded its wettest May since 1901, with more than 185mm of rainfall, according to the Indian weather department.  Many residents reported damage to their property.  At least four people were killed and dozens more were injured in one of the two heavy storms that hit the city in May, according to media reports. Meanwhile, in Bengaluru, more than 2,000kms (1,240 miles) from the capital, the problem looks different but its root cause is the same.  Once known for its network of lakes that helped manage excess rainwater, Bengaluru has seen many of these water bodies encroached upon. In their place now stand apartment complexes, business hubs and roads - leaving the city vulnerable to flooding. ""Bengaluru is made up of three major valleys through which water naturally flows. Most of the city's lakes are located in these valleys,"" explains Ram Prasad, a lake conservation activist. These valleys were originally designated as no-construction zones but over the years, encroachment has taken place and later changes in the law permitted infrastructure projects to be built in the area, he says.  ""When you convert lakes - which traditionally act as flood buffers - into built-up areas, the water has nowhere to go. So, what we're seeing in Bengaluru today is the result of poor urban planning.""  Mr Prasad points out that Bengaluru, which sits atop a hill, was never meant to flood and the current situation is entirely man-made. Violations of building norms, especially construction that narrows stormwater drains or builds directly over them, have only made things worse, he says. Meanwhile, Mumbai faces natural challenges due to its geography. For example, many parts of Mumbai are low-lying and close to the sea, which makes them more vulnerable to flooding during heavy rains and high tides. But experts say it's human actions that have made things much worse: cutting down mangroves, which normally act like natural barriers against floods, and building on floodplains where water is supposed to drain. ""The breakdown is systemic - it begins with planning that often doesn't account for future climate variabilities, gets exacerbated by poor execution and is compounded by weak enforcement of regulations,"" Mr Kukerja says. ""Political will is often reactive - responding to disasters rather than investing in long-term resilience."" This isn't just a big city problem. Smaller towns often suffer equally, if not more.  Over the weekend, at least 30 people died in India's northeastern states after heavy rains triggered flooding and landslides. Tens of thousands have been affected, with rescue efforts under way.  So, can anything be done to prevent this? ""Yes,"" says Mr Kukreja, but only if it is part of a long-term, co-ordinated strategy. He suggests using mapping and real-time sensors to identify high-risk zones and alert communities. Predictive models can also help authorities plan better responses. ""But technology alone is not a fix, it needs to be paired with responsive governance and community involvement,"" he said. For India's cities to withstand the rains, they need more than just de-watering pumps and quick fixes. They need forward-thinking planning, before the damage is done.

2025-06-03,Article,Toxic mushroom cook tells murder trial wild fungi have 'more flavour',https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce82lj7g1g7o,"An Australian woman who cooked a toxic mushroom meal has told her murder trial she has long been a mushroom lover, but more recently developed a taste for wild fungi varieties that have ""more flavour"". Erin Patterson has pleaded not guilty to the murder of three relatives, and the attempted murder of another, after serving them death cap mushrooms at her home in Victoria in July 2023.  Prosecutors say she deliberately put the poisonous mushrooms in the meal but her defence team says it was a ""terrible accident"". Ms Patterson - during her second day on the witness stand - told the jury she began foraging for wild mushrooms during the Covid pandemic, years before the fatal meal. Ms Patterson's in-laws, Don and Gail Patterson, both 70, and Gail's sister Heather Wilkinson, 66, were all hospitalised after eating beef wellington at the lunch and died several days later. Ian Wilkinson, the uncle of Ms Patterson's estranged husband, also fell seriously ill but survived after weeks of treatment. After telling the court she accepted that death cap mushrooms were in the food she had served, Ms Patterson described foraging for mushrooms at various locations - botanic gardens, a rail trail near her house, and on her own property.  ""I mainly picked field mushrooms,"" she told the court, explaining she sometimes foraged with her two children.  She recounted the first time she tried wild mushrooms, cutting off a small part before cooking it in butter.  ""[It] tasted good and I didn't get sick,"" she told the jury. The court also heard she had bought a food dehydrator in April 2023, in part because wild mushrooms had such a ""small season"" and she wanted to preserve them for later use. Asked where the mushrooms for the lunch at the centre of the case came from, Ms Patterson said ""the vast majority"" were purchased from a supermarket in Leongatha while some had been bought a few months earlier from an Asian grocery store in Melbourne.  She couldn't remember ""the specific purchase"", but had previously bought a variety of mushrooms - shitake, porcini, enoki - from similar stores, she said. Other times, she'd purchased ""wild mushroom mix"" or ""forest mushrooms"" which didn't specify exact contents. These store-bought mushrooms were often put in the same container as ones she had foraged and dehydrated herself - including in the months before the lunch - she said. Earlier Ms Patterson had stepped through changes in her dynamic with Simon Patterson and her in-laws following the couple's separation in 2015. ""In the immediate aftermath it was difficult... but that only lasted a couple of weeks... we went back to being really good friends."" Her relationship with her in-laws Don and Gail ""never changed"", she said. ""I was just their daughter-in-law - they just continued to love me."" However, she told the court her relationship with Simon turned tense amid conflict over finances from October 2022 onwards, and she had tried to get her in-laws to mediate. The court was shown expletive-laden Facebook messages that Ms Patterson sent to a private group chat, which were critical of the Simon, Don and Gail.  ""I needed to vent... to get my frustration off my chest,"" she said, and her choice was either to tell the sheep in her paddock, or speak to what she called her ""cheer squad"". Becoming emotional, she repeatedly told the court how much she cared for Don and Gail and how she wished she ""had never said that"". She also testified about a deep mistrust of the health system, developed after medical concerns she raised about her two children were initially dismissed by clinicians. These experiences led to her decision to discharge herself early from the hospital after the toxic lunch in 2023, despite doctor's advice, she said.  She also experienced health anxiety and did a lot of Dr Googling - searching the web about symptoms - which at different points in time lead her to falsely suspect she had a brain tumour, MS (multiple sclerosis) and ovarian cancer. Ms Patterson admitted that she had never been diagnosed with ovarian cancer, despite allegedly asking the lunch guests to her house to discuss the diagnosis, but said her family had a history of it. Ms Patterson is expected to continue giving evidence on Wednesday morning, local time, when the court reopens.  Copyright 2025 BBC.

2025-06-03,Article,Disney makes hundreds more layoffs as it cuts costs,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce80j93wrd2o,"Disney says it is laying off several hundred more people around the world, with workers in its film, television and finance departments impacted. The entertainment giant has been under pressure as viewers move away from cable TV subscriptions in favour of streaming platforms. ""As our industry transforms at a rapid pace, we continue to evaluate ways to efficiently manage our businesses while fuelling the state-of-the-art creativity and innovation that consumers value and expect from Disney,"" a spokesperson told the BBC. The latest job cuts follow major layoffs announced in 2023, when around 7,000 workers were let go as part of a drive by chief executive Bob Iger to save $5.5bn (£4.1bn). The cuts will impact multiple teams including marketing departments for its film and television units. Workers in Disney's casting and development and corporate finance departments will also be affected. ""We have been surgical in our approach to minimise the number of impacted employees,"" said a spokesperson. The company also said that no teams will be closed down entirely. The California-based firm employs 233,000 workers, with just over 60,000 of those based outside the US. Disney owns a host of companies across the entertainment industry including Marvel, Hulu and ESPN. The firm reported stronger than expected earnings in May, with overall revenue of $23.6bn for the first three months of the year. That was a 7% increase from the same period in 2024. It said the growth was fuelled by new subscribers to its Disney+ streaming service. The company has released a number of new films this year including Captain America: Brave New World and Snow White. The live action remake of the iconic Snow White animated film did not perform as well as expected at cinemas, after facing a number of negative reviews.  But Disney's latest release, Lilo & Stitch, broke box office records in the US for the Memorial Day holiday weekend. The animated film has seen global ticket sales of more than $610m since its release in May, according to industry data firm Box Office Mojo. Copyright 2025 BBC.

2025-06-03,Article,Trump tariffs forecast to hurt global growth,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq69j753egeo,"UK economic growth will suffer because of US tariff barriers and high interest payments on government debt, an influential global policy group has said. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) cut its expectations for UK growth this year to 1.3% from the 1.4% it had predicted in March. The think tank has cut forecasts globally due to trade tensions, but said the UK faced particular issues due to its ""very thin"" buffer in public finances, calling on Chancellor Rachel Reeves to boost tax take and cut spending. In response to the OECD's comments, Reeves said she was ""determined to go further and faster to put more money in people's pockets through our plan for change"". Next week, Reeves will set out her Spending Review where she faces tough choices on allocating departmental budgets. The government has already committed billions of pounds to defence, while the NHS is also expected to be a focus amid Labour's pledge to reduce waiting lists. In March, Reeves was forced to announce £14bn in measures, including £4.8bn in welfare cuts, to restore headroom against her self-imposed fiscal rules. While the OECD highlighted better-than-expected UK economic growth, which strengthened to 0.7% between January and March, it cautioned that ""momentum is weakening"" due to ""deteriorating"" business sentiment. It forecast the UK economy would expand by 1% in 2026, compared to the 1.2% it pencilled in a few months ago. ""The state of the public finances is a significant downside risk to the outlook if the fiscal rules are to be met,"" the OECD said. It suggested that Reeves should adopt a ""balanced approach"" of ""targeted spending cuts"" and tax increases to improve the UK's public finances. ""Strengthening the public finances remains a priority... including through the upcoming Spending Review,"" the OECD said. It suggested closing tax loopholes and re-evaluating council tax bands based on updated property values.  Under the current system, council tax in England is calculated based on the price the property would have sold for in April 1991. For Wales, it is evaluated on property prices in April 2003. Meanwhile, worldwide growth is now expected to slow to a ""modest"" 2.9%, down from a previous forecast of 3.1%, the OECD said. It blamed a ""significant"" rise in trade barriers and warned that ""weakened economic prospects will be felt around the world, with almost no exception"". The OECD's comments come as Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey told a Treasury Select Committee on Wednesday that the global system of trade agreements had been ""blown up to a considerable degree"" by global trade tensions.  Since US President Donald Trump returned to the White House, a long list of countries have been targeted by tariffs, but Trump's unpredictable approach to implementing the measures has created widespread uncertainty.  ""We are forecasting basically a downgrade for almost everybody,"" Alvaro Pereira, the OECD's chief economist told the BBC.  ""We'll have a lot less growth and job creation than we had forecasted in the past."" The group also slashed the outlook for the US economy this year from 2.2% to 1.6% and predicted growth would slow again in 2026. It warned that the US was at risk from rising inflation, something that Trump repeatedly promised would fall during his presidential campaign. Prior to the release of the OECD report on Tuesday, Trump wrote on social media: ""Because of Tariffs, our Economy is BOOMING!"" However, the most recent official data showed the US economy shrank at an annual rate of 0.2% in the first three months of this year, the first contraction since 2022.  Copyright 2025 BBC.

He made a bet with his wife in September after having a hip replacement, which he needed after getting injured while completing the walk in his hometown in 2018. After the surgeon told him he needed to slow down, Vicky joked: ""This madman will do the Llangollen Round with a fridge on his back next time."" He said he would carry a fridge freezer instead and do it twice, to which his wife replied: ""You've got yourself a bet, Mr Jones.""

2025-06-06,Article,Russia launches 'massive' strikes days after Ukrainian drone attack,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/cvg7zy1jq7no,"Russia launched large-scale drone and missile strikes on Ukraine's capital and other parts of the country early on Friday, officials said.  At least three people were killed and 49 injured in the strikes, according to Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky. The aerial raids targeted Kyiv, as well as the city of Lutsk and the Ternopil region in the north-west of the country. Russia's defence ministry said the strikes were in response to ""terrorist acts by the Kyiv regime"", adding that it had targeted military sites. The ministry said its armed forces ""overnight launched a massive strike with high-precision long-range air, sea and ground-based weapons, as well as attack drones"". The attack came after Russian President Vladimir Putin warned US President Donald Trump he would respond to Ukraine's recent strikes on Russian airbases.  In a post on X on Friday, Zelensky said that ""now is exactly the moment when America, Europe, and everyone around the world can stop this war together by pressuring Russia"". He made a thinly veiled reference to Trump's apparent unwillingness to put pressure on Russia. ""If someone is not applying pressure and is giving the war more time to take lives – that is complicity and accountability,"" Zelensky wrote. ""We must act decisively."" Zelensky said that ""as of now"", three deaths had been confirmed in the strikes - all employees of Ukraine's state emergency services. He said the attack used more than 400 drones and more than 40 missiles, and the number of people injured ""may increase"". In an earlier statement, Kyiv's Mayor Vitali Klitschko said four people had been killed in the country's capital. Air raid alerts were in place in Kyiv, where a residential building was hit, and the city's train system was disrupted after shelling damaged metro tracks. Tens of thousands of civilians in the capital spent a restless few hours in underground shelters. From the centre of the city, prolonged bursts of machine gun fire could be heard as air defences on the outskirts attempted to bring down scores of drones aimed at Kyiv.  From time to time, the distinctive buzz of drones overhead could also be heard. Bright flashes of light, sometimes reflected on nearby buildings, would be followed, five or ten seconds later, by thunderous explosions. Authorities say the attacks included 38 cruise missiles, which is the kind Ukraine targeted in Sunday's so-called ""Spider's Web"" operation, suggesting this attack could be a message from the Kremlin. The cities of Kharkiv, Sumy and Luhansk were also under air raid alerts. Elsewhere, Ternopil's military chief Vyacheslav Negoda said Friday's strike was the ""most massive air attack on our region to date"". Mayor of Ternopil, Igor Polishchuk, said five people were wounded in the attack and there was damage to homes, schools and a government facility. In Lutsk, five people were injured in an attack using 15 drones and six missiles, according to mayor Ihor Polishchuk.  Meanwhile, the Russian defence ministry said its air defences shot down 174 Ukrainian drones overnight in parts of Russia and occupied Crimea.  The ministry said Neptune anti-ship cruise missiles were also intercepted over the Black Sea.  Russia's latest attack on Ukraine comes days after Kyiv launched its biggest long-range drone strike on at least 40 Russian warplanes at four military bases. Zelensky said 117 drones were used in the Spider's Web operation by the SBU security service, striking ""34% of [Russia's] strategic cruise missile carriers"". Earlier this month, direct peace talks between Russia and Ukraine took place in Istanbul, but ended without a major breakthrough.  Ukrainian negotiators said Russia rejected an ""unconditional ceasefire"" - a key demand of Kyiv and its Western allies including the US. The Russian team said they had proposed a two-or three-day truce ""in certain areas"" of the vast front line, but gave no further details. Trump said Putin vowed to ""very strongly"" respond to Ukraine's recent attack on Russian airbases, during a phone call that lasted more than an hour on Wednesday.  Moscow had previously said that military options were ""on the table"" for its response to Ukraine's attack. Last week, Trump appeared to set a two-week deadline for Putin, threatening to change how the US is responding to Russia if he believed Putin was still ""tapping"" him along on peace efforts in Ukraine.

2025-06-06,Article,Russia launches 'massive' strikes days after Ukrainian drone attack,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/cvg7zy1jq7no,"Russia launched large-scale drone and missile strikes on Ukraine's capital and other parts of the country early on Friday, officials said.  At least three people were killed and 49 injured in the strikes, according to Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky. The aerial raids targeted Kyiv, as well as the city of Lutsk and the Ternopil region in the north-west of the country. Russia's defence ministry said the strikes were in response to ""terrorist acts by the Kyiv regime"", adding that it had targeted military sites. The ministry said its armed forces ""overnight launched a massive strike with high-precision long-range air, sea and ground-based weapons, as well as attack drones"". The attack came after Russian President Vladimir Putin warned US President Donald Trump he would respond to Ukraine's recent strikes on Russian airbases.  In a post on X on Friday, Zelensky said that ""now is exactly the moment when America, Europe, and everyone around the world can stop this war together by pressuring Russia"". He made a thinly veiled reference to Trump's apparent unwillingness to put pressure on Russia. ""If someone is not applying pressure and is giving the war more time to take lives – that is complicity and accountability,"" Zelensky wrote. ""We must act decisively."" Zelensky said that ""as of now"", three deaths had been confirmed in the strikes - all employees of Ukraine's state emergency services. He said the attack used more than 400 drones and more than 40 missiles, and the number of people injured ""may increase"". In an earlier statement, Kyiv's Mayor Vitali Klitschko said four people had been killed in the country's capital. Air raid alerts were in place in Kyiv, where a residential building was hit, and the city's train system was disrupted after shelling damaged metro tracks. Tens of thousands of civilians in the capital spent a restless few hours in underground shelters. From the centre of the city, prolonged bursts of machine gun fire could be heard as air defences on the outskirts attempted to bring down scores of drones aimed at Kyiv.  From time to time, the distinctive buzz of drones overhead could also be heard. Bright flashes of light, sometimes reflected on nearby buildings, would be followed, five or ten seconds later, by thunderous explosions. Authorities say the attacks included 38 cruise missiles, which is the kind Ukraine targeted in Sunday's so-called ""Spider's Web"" operation, suggesting this attack could be a message from the Kremlin. The cities of Kharkiv, Sumy and Luhansk were also under air raid alerts. Elsewhere, Ternopil's military chief Vyacheslav Negoda said Friday's strike was the ""most massive air attack on our region to date"". Mayor of Ternopil, Igor Polishchuk, said five people were wounded in the attack and there was damage to homes, schools and a government facility. In Lutsk, five people were injured in an attack using 15 drones and six missiles, according to mayor Ihor Polishchuk.  Meanwhile, the Russian defence ministry said its air defences shot down 174 Ukrainian drones overnight in parts of Russia and occupied Crimea.  The ministry said Neptune anti-ship cruise missiles were also intercepted over the Black Sea.  Russia's latest attack on Ukraine comes days after Kyiv launched its biggest long-range drone strike on at least 40 Russian warplanes at four military bases. Zelensky said 117 drones were used in the Spider's Web operation by the SBU security service, striking ""34% of [Russia's] strategic cruise missile carriers"".

2025-06-06,Article,How bitter feud escalated - and what happens next,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/c3wd2215q08o,"What happens when the richest person and the most powerful politician have a knock-down, drag-out fight? The world is finding out – and it's not a pretty picture. Donald Trump and Elon Musk have two of the biggest megaphones, and they have now turned them on each other, as a disagreement has ballooned into a war of words. Trump has threatened Musk's voluminous business dealings with the federal government, which form the lifeblood of his SpaceX programme. ""The easiest way to save money in our budget, billions and billions of dollars, is to terminate Elon's governmental subsidies and contracts,"" Trump posted menacingly on his own social media website. If Trump turns the machinery of government against Musk, the tech billionaire will feel pain. Tesla's stock price plunged by 14% on Thursday. It's not a one-way street, however. After that volley, Musk called for Trump's impeachment and dared him to cut funding for his companies.  Musk also said he was accelerating the decommissioning of his Dragon spacecraft, which the US relies on to carry American astronauts and supplies to the International Space Station.  But hours later, he appeared to back down from that threat, saying in response to a post on X urging him to cool off: ""Good advice. Ok, we won't decommission Dragon."" Musk has near limitless resources to respond, including by funding insurgent challengers to Republicans in next year's elections and primaries. And late on Thursday afternoon, he said he was dropping the ""really big bomb"" – suggesting without evidence that Trump appears in unreleased files related to late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.  His press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, offered only a tepid pushback to Musk's allegations and accusations. ""This is an unfortunate episode from Elon, who is unhappy with the One Big Beautiful Bill because it does not include the policies he wanted,"" she said.  Musk may not win a fight against the whole of Trump's government, but he could exact a high political - and personal - price for Trump and the Republicans. Trump, perhaps aware of this, appeared to tamp down the heat a bit by the end of the day. He avoided commenting on Musk during a public appearance at a White House event and posted a message on Truth Social that said he didn't mind ""turning against him"", but wishes he had quit government service months ago.  He then pivoted to boosting of his ""big, beautiful"" tax and spending legislation. It's difficult to envision an easy walk-down after Thursday's heat, however. The feud started at a simmer last week, began bubbling on Wednesday and became a full-on boil on Thursday afternoon in the Oval Office. As new German Chancellor Friedrich Merz – the day's visitor – sat in awkward silence, the president sounded a bit like a spurned lover. He expressed surprise at Musk's criticism of his legislation. He pushed back against the notion that he would have lost last year's presidential election without Musk's hundreds of millions of dollars in support. And he said Musk was only changing his tune now because his car company, Tesla, will be hurt by the Republican push to end electric vehicle tax credits. Musk quickly took to his social media site, X, with a very Generation X response for his 220 million followers: ""Whatever"".  He said he didn't care about the car subsidies, and that he wanted to shrink the national debt, which he says is an existential threat to the nation. He insisted that Democrats would have prevailed in last year's election without his help. ""Such ingratitude,"" he told Trump. The billionaire then launched a series of extraordinary attacks throughout the afternoon, and the feud was on in earnest. Musk and Trump had formed a powerful but unlikely alliance, culminating in the tech billionaire having a key position of budget-slashing authority in the Trump administration. Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, or Doge, became one of the biggest stories of Trump's first 100 days, as it shuttered entire agencies and dismissed thousands of government workers. It wasn't long, however, before speculation began over when – and how - the two outsized personalities would ultimately fall out. For a while, it seemed like those predictions were off the mark. Trump stood by Musk even as the latter's popularity dropped, as he feuded with administration officials and as he became a liability in several key elections earlier this year.  Every time it appeared there would be a break, Musk would pop up in the Oval Office, or the Cabinet room or on the president's Air Force One flight to Mar-a-Lago. When Musk's 130 days as a ""special government employee"" ended last week, the two had a chummy Oval Office send-off, with a golden key to the White House and hints that Musk might someday return. It's safe to say that any invitation has been rescinded and the locks have been changed. ""Elon and I had a great relationship,"" Trump said on Thursday – a comment notable for its use of the past tense. There had been some thought that Trump's surprise announcement on Wednesday night of a new travel ban, additional sanctions on Harvard and a conspiracy-laced administration investigation of former President Joe Biden were all efforts to change the subject from Musk's criticism. The White House and its allies in Congress seemed careful not to further antagonise him after his earlier comments. Then Trump spoke out and… so much for that. Now the question is where the dispute goes next. Congressional Republicans could find it harder to keep their members behind Trump's bill with Musk providing rhetorical and, perhaps financial, air cover for those who break ranks. Trump has already threatened Musk's government contracts, but he could also take aim at his remaining Doge allies in the administration or reopen Biden-era investigations into Musk's business dealings. Everything at this point is on the table. Meanwhile, Democrats are on the sidelines, wondering how to respond. Few seem willing to welcome Musk, a former donor to their party, back into the fold. But there's also the old adage that the enemy of an enemy is a friend. ""It's a zero-sum game,"" Liam Kerr, a Democratic strategist, told Politico. ""Anything that he does that moves more toward Democrats hurts Republicans."" At the very least, Democrats seem happy to stand back and let the two men exchange blows. And until they abandon this fight, the din is likely to drown out everything else in American politics. But don't expect this spat to end anytime soon. ""Trump has 3.5 years left as president,"" Musk wrote on X, ""but I will be around for 40-plus years.""

2025-06-06,Article,Australian mushroom lunch cook tells trial meal was 'special',https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/c5y8e1l55kko,"An Australian woman accused of intentionally cooking a fatal mushroom lunch has told her trial she had wanted the beef Wellington meal to be ""special"". Erin Patterson has pleaded not guilty to murdering three people and attempting to kill another at her home in regional Victoria in July 2023.  The 50-year-old says it was a tragic accident, and that she never intended to hurt family members she loved. But prosecutors argue Ms Patterson put poisonous fungi into their food in a carefully crafted plot to kill them. On Friday, the court heard it was ""unusual"" for Ms Patterson to host such an event at her house, and she was quizzed about her relationships with her guests. Ms Patterson's in-laws, Don and Gail Patterson, both 70, along with Gail's sister Heather Wilkinson, 66, all fell ill and died days after the lunch. Heather's husband, local pastor Ian Wilkinson, was also hospitalised but recovered after coming out of a weeks-long induced coma. Simon Patterson, the accused's estranged spouse, had been invited too, but pulled out the day before. More than 50 prosecution witnesses have given evidence at the trial, which began six weeks ago, but Ms Patterson became the first for the defence when she took to the stand on Monday. On her second day of cross-examination on Friday, Ms Patterson told the court she accepted that invites to her house were rare, but said she'd arranged the occasion to discuss a health issue and wanted to make a nice meal for her relatives to thank them for their support. ""I wanted it to be special,"" Ms Patterson said. She has previously admitted she misled her guests into believing she may need cancer treatment, telling the jury she did so as a cover for weight-loss surgery she was planning to have but was too embarrassed to disclose. Prosecutor Nanette Rogers, however, put to her that there was no health issue to discuss, and that she had invited Simon and his relatives over to kill them. She had even prepared a spare toxic meal in case Mr Patterson changed his mind and came over, Dr Rogers suggested. Over and over this week, Ms Patterson has denied these allegations, often becoming emotional as she told the court she loved the lunch guests like her own family. She has also repeatedly told the court that she realised, in the days after the lunch, that the beef Wellington may have accidentally included dried mushrooms she had foraged, which were kept in a container with store-bought ones.  Lies to the police and health authorities about the source of the mushrooms and her decision to dispose of a food dehydrator were both because she was scared of being blamed for the guests' dire illnesses, she said. ""Surely if you had loved them, then you would have immediately notified the medical authorities?"" Dr Rogers asked. Ms Patterson said she didn't tell doctors about the possibility that wild mushrooms had been unintentionally included because the lunch guests were already getting treatment for death cap mushroom poisoning. ""Even after you were discharged from hospital you did not tell a single person that there may have been foraged mushroom used in the meal,"" Dr Rogers said. ""Instead you got up, you drove your children to school... and drove home. And then you got rid of the dehydrator."" ""Correct,"" Ms Patterson said. The court heard there'd been conflict between Ms Patterson and her husband, and Dr Rogers suggested the accused was still angry at her in-laws for taking their son's side. ""You had two faces,"" Dr Rogers said, after making Ms Patterson read aloud messages in which she is critical of both Simon Patterson and his parents. There was her ""public face"" of appearing to have a good relationship with Don and Gail, Dr Rogers said, and a ""private face"" which she showed in the messages. ""How you truly felt about Don and Gail was how you expressed it [there],"" she said. ""And that is how you really felt about Simon Patterson... you did not regard him as being a decent human being at his core, correct or incorrect?"" That was ""incorrect"", Ms Patterson replied, her head shaking and voice faltering. Ms Patterson's use of the iNaturalist website - which listed locations of death cap mushrooms in areas close to her home - was also scrutinised, with the accused repeatedly saying she couldn't clearly recall ever using the site. She will resume being cross examined next week. The trial, initially expected to take six weeks, is now expected to run for at least another fortnight, the judge has told the court.

2025-06-06,Article,'Underwater needle in a haystack' - how a diver found a 140-year-old shipwreck,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/czel8y3dxp5o,"The mystery of a maritime disaster has been solved after experts found a vessel that sank almost 140 years ago. Diver and explorer Dom Robinson identified the SS Nantes, off Plymouth, after examining the wreck site and finding crockery. Dr Harry Bennett, an expert in maritime history, said the dive team had found ""the underwater archaeological equivalent of a needle in a haystack"". Mr Robinson said solving the mystery ensured those who died were not forgotten. In November 1888, the SS Nantes, which was operated by the Cunard Steamship Company, collided with a German sailing vessel, the Theodor Ruger, said Dr Bennett. The crew spent ""several hours"" trying to save their ship, the honorary associate professor in history at the University of Plymouth said. ""They used mattresses to plug the gap which had opened up in the hull of the SS Nantes,"" he said. ""[The ship sank] with the loss of a substantial number of the crew. There were some 23-odd fatalities. There were three survivors."" Bodies from the wreckage washed ashore at Talland Bay and Looe, in Cornwall, and ""locals were confronted by this picture of horror, pieces of ship together with bodies,"" he said. Afterwards the ""wreck was essentially lost, obviously you're dealing in a period with no satellite navigation,"" said Dr Bennett. He added while the crew tried to save the ship it ""drifted for several hours, before it finally made its way to the bottom, sadly, with many of its crewmen on board"". He said the wreck was lost until a local dive team identified it in 2024. Mr Robinson, who has been diving for about 35 years, said he heard about the unidentified wreck from the UK Hydrographic Office. He said the wreck ""was clearly an early steamship when we got down there"" but ""at the end of my dive I found a broken piece of plate... I decided to bring it up to the surface [and] we found that had the Cunard Steamship crest on it"". ""It was then bingo, we've found it,"" he said.  Dr Bennett said it was identified by the build and dimensions of the wreck, the technology on board, the cargo and ""lastly and most telling, they find a plate on the back of which is stamped Cunard - this is a Cunard ship"". ""[It was] very methodical, very, very dedicated detective work,"" he said. Mr Robinson said: ""This was an awful tragedy. One of the things I like to think is by solving mysteries and telling those stories I'm ensuring that those people aren't forgotten."" Since the initial find, Mr Robinson said he had dived the wreck again and found a second piece of Cunard crockery, providing ""even more confirmation"". ""There are very few mysteries left to explore in this world,"" he said. ""As a normal human being like me, going in exploring shipwrecks and identifying shipwrecks, that is just something different to my normal life, and it's a fantastic feeling."" Dr Bennett said ""all the pieces fit and I think the local dive team are to be congratulated on a splendid piece of detective work which reveals this maritime disaster"".  He said he had looked at the footage and methodology and had confirmed they were right ""beyond any reasonable shadow of a doubt, this is the SS Nantes"".

2025-06-06,Article,Olly Alexander: I've come into a different space in my life,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/c4g3ele74l3o,"Singer and actor Olly Alexander has said he has ""come into a different space in my life"", as he announced a new West End stage role after recently parting ways with his record label. The star will appear in the National Theatre's production of The Importance of Being Earnest when it transfers to the West End in September. It will be his first acting role since It's A Sin, Channel 4's acclaimed 2021 drama about the Aids crisis, for which he was nominated for a Bafta Award. ""I'd recently been thinking that I'd love to act again,"" Alexander told BBC News. ""I'd come to the end of my record contract, and I have a bit more breathing space to try a few different things and not feel, oh, well I have to deliver an album to my record label."" He will take over from Doctor Who star Ncuti Gatwa, who starred in The Importance of Being Earnest when it opened at the National Theatre in 2024.  Alexander will play Algernon when the show moves to the Noel Coward Theatre in London, in collaboration with Sonia Friedman Productions.  ""What's not to love?"" he asked. ""It's such a brilliant play, Oscar Wilde's most celebrated comedy. I saw the National production and thought it was fantastic, and this opportunity came along and I jumped at the chance."" Alexander shot to fame when his band Years & Years won the BBC Sound of 2015 poll and went on to have hits such as King and Shine, and score a number one album. He later went solo, although continued to perform as Years & Years, and scored another top-charting album in 2021. He has performed with Sir Elton John and Kylie Minogue, and was the UK's Eurovision entrant last year. However, after his most recent album Polari, released in February, reached number 17, Alexander announced his departure from his record label. ""They aren't dropping me, they just aren't renewing my contract,"" he explained at the time. ""It's OK and honestly for the best. I've been on a pretty terrible deal for 10 years. It's time I do something new. But I'll still make music in the future."" Reflecting on his first decade as a pop star, Alexander told the BBC: ""With music, there's an intensity to the way I've been working and putting albums out, promoting and touring. I definitely want to take the foot off the gas in terms of that intensity.""  He still occasionally works on music, but has ""not been putting pressure on myself... I just do what feels good and feel very lucky that I have this other strand of acting that I'm able to explore"". Alexander said he felt he had ""learned so much"" over the last decade about the way he likes to work.  ""But for me,"" he continued, ""a lot of the reason I think the [music] industry has changed so much is that it's set on this model which is very antiquated now, and it's not kept pace with the times.  ""Lots of artists have this direct link with their audience via social media. They want their music out quickly. The whole model of promoting it - three singles into an album, then you tour the album, then move onto the next one - it's not really working like it did."" He noted that record labels could historically make an album a success because they were ""able to pour a lot of money into something"". ""They just can't do that now. Everything has changed. But I think that is exciting for lots of reasons, and it is an exciting place for artists, even though it's harder to break through.""  He concluded: ""If I go back into it, it'll be because I think it's fun and something I want to do, and not think too much about how it's going to perform.  ""That's pretty much how I try to always feel, but you're in an environment where you have a lot of other stakeholders, and people telling you it needs to be this or that, and there's always that tension."" For now, he is focusing on acting. First performed in 1895, The Importance of being Earnest follows two male friends who adopt fictional personas. The farcical comedy unfolds with mistaken identities and makes generous use of clever wordplay. ""In a nutshell, it's a comedy about two quite ridiculous young men and the double lives they lead,"" Alexander explained. ""They do that to avoid their social obligations, and they both invent these aliases called Ernest, while they try and woo and marry these two young women.  ""But really, it's a comedy that skewers society's expectations, makes fun of class and what society expects of us, and what roles we're expected to perform."" The previous production of the show, starring Gatwa, received a positive reception from critics.  ""There is an elegance to the nudge-wink references and it is a production with just the right amount of delightful mischief,"" wrote the Guardian's Arifa Akbar in a four-star review. The Daily Mail's Patrick Marmion awarded five stars, describing the ""sparkling new production"" as a ""witty reboot"". ""Yes, liberties are taken,"" he said. ""But that is surely the best way of blowing the dust off this national treasure."" In a three-star review, the Telegraph's Dominic Cavendish described the show as ""defiantly bold, but more playful than antagonistic"", although he added he wasn't sure the new iteration ""adds much"" to the original. In the play, nobody except Jack and Algernon know about their alter-egos - something which would be much more difficult to pull off now in an age of smartphones. ""It'd be impossible!"" Alexander laughed. ""Our every movement is captured, so there's less room to invent aliases and lead double lives, which in some circumstances is probably for the best.  ""What's brilliant about the play is it's set 100 years ago, at a time that feels so different to where we are now, but the themes are so timeless."" Alexander last appeared in the West End in 2013, before becoming famous as a pop star, with a relatively small role in Peter & Alice alongside Dame Judi Dench. In 2024, Alexander finished in 18th place at Eurovision with his track Dizzy, in a tricky year for the contest which was partly overshadowed by controversy surrounding Israel's participation. This year's entrants, girl group Remember Monday, ended in a similar position, finishing 19th. Alexander praised their performance, adding that he ""hopes to meet up with them soon and we can exchange stories"". ""But,"" he added, ""I think I'll still be processing and reflecting [on Eurovision] for a long time."" The singer is excited to be returning to the West End, not least because it will mean performing continuously in one venue. ""I spent a lot of my previous years moving around, touring, which is so fun and amazing,"" he reflects. ""But I also very much appreciate staying in one place now. ""Having a home in London with my partner, my cats, just trotting off to the theatre every night - that just sounds like the most wonderful existence."" Copyright 2025 BBC.

2025-06-06,Article,Judge temporarily blocks Trump's ban on foreign Harvard students ,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/c991lz2zd0ko,"A US judge has issued a temporary restraining order blocking the Trump administration from enforcing a ban the president ordered barring Harvard University from accepting international students.  The order by Judge Allison Burroughs, who is based in Massachusetts, said the oldest university in the US would face ""immediate and irreparable injury"" if the proclamation went into effect. It comes in response to a lawsuit filed by Harvard on Thursday accusing President Donald Trump of waging a ""government vendetta"" intended to stifle free speech. Trump has argued that the ban is necessary on national security grounds, and has accused Harvard of not doing enough to stop antisemitism on campus.  The federal judge's order comes only hours after Harvard amended an existing lawsuit against the US government, claiming that Trump's move is ""part of a concerted and escalating campaign of retaliation by the government in clear retribution for Harvard's exercising its First Amendment rights"" to free speech. Harvard President Alan Garber also issued a statement saying that the Ivy League school was developing contingency plans for international students in the event they are not able to travel to campus. The world's wealthiest university has been embroiled in a legal battle with the Trump administration after it froze billions of dollars of federal funding and accused the institution of failing to root out antisemitism on campus. In May, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem revoked certification Harvard needed to enrol foreign students on campus, a move that was swiftly blocked by a judge. The BBC has contacted the DHS for comment on the latest order. Another federal judge upheld that decision last week, saying she would issue a longer-term hold that would allow international students to continue their studies at Harvard while the legal battle plays out. The move triggered Trump's order on Wednesday, which suspended for an initial six months the entry of foreign students seeking to study or participate in exchange programmes at Harvard University. Trump's proclamation accused Harvard of developing ""extensive entanglements"" with foreign countries and continuing to ""flout the civil rights of its students and faculty"".

2025-06-06,Article,Lululemon shares plunge as Trump tariffs bite,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/c8re86n23j5o,"Lululemon shares have plunged by more than 20% after it cut its annual profit forecast, as the company navigates tariffs and fears about the US economy slowing. ""We experienced lower store traffic in the Americas, partially reflective of economic uncertainty, inflationary pressures, lower consumer confidence, and changes in discretionary spending,"" Lululemon said in a statement. The athleisure brand joins a growing list of big companies to warn about the impact of US President Donald Trump's trade policies.  The Trump administration's approach to tariffs has triggered concerns over rising prices and a weakening economy. ""We are planning to take strategic price increases... on a small portion of our assortment, and they will be modest in nature,"" Lululemon's finance chief Meghan Frank said. The company also said it will cut costs and negotiate with its vendors. Last year, 40% of its products were made in Vietnam, and 28% of its fabrics came from mainland China. Clothing and footwear brands are among the businesses hit hardest by tariffs as they make goods in Asian countries, which have faced steep levies from the US. In April, sportswear giant Adidas warned that import taxes imposed by Trump will lead to higher prices in the US for popular trainers including the Gazelle and Samba. ""Since we currently cannot produce almost any of our products in the US, these higher tariffs will eventually cause higher costs for all our products for the US market,"" chief executive Bjorn Gulden said. Also in April, footwear maker Skechers withdrew its annual results forecast, citing economic uncertainty. ""The current environment is simply too dynamic from which to plan results with a reasonable assurance of success,"" Skechers' chief operating officer, David Weinberg, told investors in a post-earnings call. Last month, Nike said it would raise prices on some trainers and clothing in the US from early June. The sportswear giant did not name US tariffs explicitly as a reason for the increase, saying it regularly made ""price adjustments"". Copyright 2025 BBC.

2025-06-06,Article,Judge temporarily blocks Trump's ban on foreign Harvard students ,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/c991lz2zd0ko,"A US judge has issued a temporary restraining order blocking the Trump administration from enforcing a ban the president ordered barring Harvard University from accepting international students.  The order by Judge Allison Burroughs, who is based in Massachusetts, said the oldest university in the US would face ""immediate and irreparable injury"" if the proclamation went into effect. It comes in response to a lawsuit filed by Harvard on Thursday accusing President Donald Trump of waging a ""government vendetta"" intended to stifle free speech. Trump has argued that the ban is necessary on national security grounds, and has accused Harvard of not doing enough to stop antisemitism on campus.  The federal judge's order comes only hours after Harvard amended an existing lawsuit against the US government, claiming that Trump's move is ""part of a concerted and escalating campaign of retaliation by the government in clear retribution for Harvard's exercising its First Amendment rights"" to free speech. Harvard President Alan Garber also issued a statement saying that the Ivy League school was developing contingency plans for international students in the event they are not able to travel to campus. The world's wealthiest university has been embroiled in a legal battle with the Trump administration after it froze billions of dollars of federal funding and accused the institution of failing to root out antisemitism on campus. In May, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem revoked certification Harvard needed to enrol foreign students on campus, a move that was swiftly blocked by a judge. The BBC has contacted the DHS for comment on the latest order. Another federal judge upheld that decision last week, saying she would issue a longer-term hold that would allow international students to continue their studies at Harvard while the legal battle plays out. The move triggered Trump's order on Wednesday, which suspended for an initial six months the entry of foreign students seeking to study or participate in exchange programmes at Harvard University. Trump's proclamation accused Harvard of developing ""extensive entanglements"" with foreign countries and continuing to ""flout the civil rights of its students and faculty"". For the 2024-2025 school year, Harvard enrolled nearly 7,000 foreign students, who made up 27% of its population. Copyright 2025 BBC.

2025-06-06,Article,Beyoncé dazzles on first night of London residency after slow ticket sales,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/cvgvlxk01gvo,"Beyoncé signed off the first night of her London residency by telling fans she was ""blessed"" to get to do what she loves by performing on stage. She stormed through a seven-act set at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, treating the audience to a spectacle that lasted just shy of three hours. But despite this being the first opportunity for fans to enjoy the singer's country era in person, slow ticket sales and high prices have been the hot topic around the tour. Promoters slashed some ticket prices in the run-up to shows in a bid to fill the stadium, prompting some of those who bought seats in advance to feel short-changed. Beyoncé's rodeo rumbled into London, bringing with it every country cliché you could think of - cowboy hats, horseshoes, tassels and even a gold mechanical bull. The 40-song setlist relied heavily on tracks from 2024's Cowboy Carter, which was met with critical acclaim, including taking the top album prize at this year's Grammy Awards. Every element of the performance was flawless, from the 43-year-old superstar's stunning array of costume changes (each one featuring more rhinestones than the last) to the seamless transitions between songs and musical themes. Much of the talk around the US leg of this tour, which took place in April and May, was the inclusion of Beyoncé and Jay-Z's 13-year-old daughter Blue Ivy. She made several appearances throughout the show, earning thunderous applause whilst dancing to an instrumental performance of her mum's 2006 hit Deja Vu. The teenager certainly seemed to enjoy her moment in the spotlight, unlike her younger sister, Rumi, who came on stage during Protector, shyly mouthing the words whilst being held by Beyoncé.  The show, which is called The Cowboy Carter and the Rodeo Chitlin' Circuit Tour as a way of referencing black performers that were segregated from the country scene, often paid homage in its interludes to these artists. Beyoncé herself previously hinted about being rejected from the country music world in the past and throughout the performance it felt like she was wrestling with this idea. She blended some of her biggest hits into Cowboy Carter tracks, such as Freedom and Diva, almost to prove that she belonged in this space. Thursday night's performance certainly showed she is more than qualified to be a country singer, but perhaps that a 60,000 seater stadium is not the best arena for it. As the night drew darker, Beyoncé delivered an act comprised of tracks from her house-inspired album Renaissance, which immediately lifted the crowd into a party mood. LED wristbands lit up in array of colours as she belted out Alien Superstar and I'm That Girl - which certainly got the best reaction from fans of the night. Similarly a section of old classics such as Crazy In Love and Irreplaceable had the crowd singing every word, proving perhaps that a few more classics wouldn't have gone amiss. With crowds on their feet, it was difficult to see how sold out the stadium actually was, but with just hours to go until the show there were still thousands of tickets available for sale online. Despite the tour only stopping in two European cities - London and Paris - the remaining eight dates are not sold out. Beyoncé's tour has the highest top-priced ticket of any artist visiting the UK in 2025 at £950, with the cheapest costing £71. Some seats that were sold in the Beyhive fan presale for £620 excluding fees are next to seats that were available this week for £141.60, also without fees. Zulkarnain Sadali flew from Singapore to London to watch Beyoncé perform live and bought a ticket in the pre-sale, which he said cost him ""more than £700"". ""A couple of weeks ago I checked my ticket and then curiosity got the best of me and I checked the same ticket, or same category, and the price was around £300,"" he told the BBC. ""I'm really excited for [the show] but I will say the dynamic pricing really left a sour taste in my mouth."" Another fan, Holly Whiteman, said she ""panic bought"" Beyoncé tickets in a fan pre-sale on Ticketmaster, which were ""way up in the nosebleeds"" and cost £170 each, when she had initially set a budget of £100. ""Fast forward a few days later, the tickets went on general sale through Tottenham Hotspur and I found tickets for the same show in both the same row and the same section for a much cheaper price,"" she told the BBC. ""I believe they were at least £50-£70 cheaper per ticket."" Sadali said that despite feeling short-changed, it had not dented his excitement for the tour. ""It's really about the Beyoncé experience, you're not gonna get it anywhere else and I know this sounds like a contradiction, it's worth every cent,"" he said. Whiteman said the process had left her a bit ""disappointed"", but she was still looking forward to the tour. A Ticketmaster spokesperson told the BBC they do ""not use surge pricing or dynamic algorithms to adjust ticket prices"", adding that event organisers are responsible for the pricing structures. ""Since tickets typically go on sale at least 3-6 months before the event, organisers may review prices at key points leading up to the show, but they make any adjustments, not an algorithm,"" they also added. The BBC also contacted tour promoter Live Nation for comment. Ticketing expert Reg Walker put the lack of sold-out shows down to several factors, including ""overexposure"" after her last UK stadium tour, which played five nights at the same venue in 2023. And the ticket prices are ""eye-watering"", he told the BBC. ""You might be able to afford to go to one of her concerts where you're effectively paying, in some categories, the same amount of money as a small holiday, but you can't do that on consecutive years. ""The pricing strategy on tickets was clearly far too high,"" he added. Walker said there were a lot of ""affordably priced"" tours coming up - but with so many artists visiting the UK this summer, fans may be picking and choosing who they pay to go and see. Billie Eilish, Lana Del Rey, Dua Lipa, Kendrick Lamar and SZA are all embarking on stadium tours over the coming months, with Olivia Rodrigo, Sabrina Carpenter, Chapell Roan and Drake headlining festivals.

2025-06-06,Article,The long wait for answers over the Lockerbie bombing grows longer,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/c3v52yw335xo,"Major television productions are bringing the story of the Lockerbie bombing to a new global audience, but the real life drama of the trial of a new Libyan suspect has been delayed once more. Abu Agila Mohammed Mas'ud Kheir al-Marimi, known as Masud, had been due to face a Washington jury last month, accused of making the bomb that destroyed Pan Am Flight 103 and killed 270 people. The 12 May starting date was abandoned because of problems with his health and the complexity of the case, and the trial is now scheduled to start in April, 2026.. The date was set at the District of Columbia District Court, where Masud listened with the help of a translator and was expressionless throughout. After the hearing, relatives of American victims of the bombing told BBC News of their disappointment that the trial is now scheduled to start 50 weeks later than originally planned. Kara Weipz is the president of the US group Victims of Pan Am Flight 103 and lost her 20-year-old brother Richard Monetti on the plane. ""I'm just going to pray that it stays at 20 April,"" she said. ""I was 15 when this happened, and I'm 52 now and among the relatives I'm considered young. ""A lot of our family members are in their seventies and eighties and unfortunately, we lose them weekly or monthly now. ""The travesty in all of this that they're not seeing the justice that they've worked 37 years to see. ""That's what concerns us the most, that this trial will come around and we'll have lost more family members."" Victoria Cummock's husband John was coming home from a business trip to Europe a day earlier than planned, to surprise his family. The founder of the Pan Am 103 Lockerbie Legacy Foundation, Mrs Cummock said: ""We've lived through 36 years of delays and postponements simply because this is an international case filled with politics. ""Thirty six years with seven different administrations in America have really collided with the families' search for accountability and justice. ""It's no surprise that our mission to hold them to account is being delayed."" Mrs Cummock added she was concerned that President Trump's ban on Libyan citizens travelling to the US could affect the trial. She said: ""It just seems like it's a very slow journey to getting this case started."" Masud has been in US custody since December 2022 and has pled not guilty to the charges. The Tunisian-born Libyan is in his seventies and is understood to have diabetes and heart problems. His family in Libya has already expressed concerns over the delays to the case, saying he's an innocent man. The new trial date was fixed after a joint motion submitted by the prosecution and the defence, both of whom raised the international nature of the evidence and witnesses. A series of crucial legal arguments will have to be resolved before the trial can go ahead, with the judge Dabney Friedrich describing the 20 April date as ""tentative."" Those will include the admissibility of a confession Masud is alleged to have made while in custody in 2012, following the collapse of Colonel Gaddafi's regime. Another complication is the fact that new information on the case is still emerging, almost four decades after the attack. A book published in France revealed the existence of documents said to have been retrieved from the archives of the Libyan intelligence service, of which Masud is alleged to have been a member. If proved genuine, those documents detail his involvement in preparations for the attack on Pan Am 103. It's more than 24 years since the first Lockerbie trial, when three Scottish judges convicted Libyan intelligence agent Abdulbasset al-Megrahi of playing a key role in the plot. Megrahi was jailed for life but released on compassionate grounds by the Scottish government in 2009 after he was diagnosed with terminal cancer. He died three years later at home in Tripoli. His release infuriated many of the American relatives, which is why they have set so much store on the trial of Masud, the first suspect to face an American court over Lockerbie. They believe it will deliver the justice they were denied by the Scottish legal system. The bombing remains the worst terror attack in British history and claimed the lives of 43 UK citizens. Some, but not all, of the British relatives have never accepted the verdict against Megrahi, including the Rev John Mosey, whose daughter Helga was on the plane. ""I think they're just waiting for people like me to pop our clogs and get out of the way,"" he said. ""I'm still pretty cynical about the whole thing. I would like to be proved wrong but I can't see it happening. ""As far as I'm concerned, who made the bomb and who put in on the plane are secondary as to who were the main criminals. ""They were the group of people who had all the warnings that this was going to happen and warned their own people but didn't warn the public."" The big budget television dramas may have pushed the Lockerbie bombing back into the public eye but it's clear that there's a very long way to go before a jury delivers its verdict on Masud. Judge Friedrich warned that if things are not done in a timely manner, there's a risk the trial could ""slip"" into 2027. As she reminded everyone in the court: ""This isn't a normal criminal case.""

2025-06-06,Article,Russia launches 'massive' strikes days after Ukrainian drone attack,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/cvg7zy1jq7no,"Russia launched large-scale drone and missile strikes on Ukraine's capital and other parts of the country early on Friday, officials said.  At least three people were killed and 49 injured in the strikes, according to Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky. The aerial raids targeted Kyiv, as well as the city of Lutsk and the Ternopil region in the north-west of the country. Russia's defence ministry said the strikes were in response to ""terrorist acts by the Kyiv regime"", adding that it had targeted military sites. The ministry said its armed forces ""overnight launched a massive strike with high-precision long-range air, sea and ground-based weapons, as well as attack drones"". The attack came after Russian President Vladimir Putin warned US President Donald Trump he would respond to Ukraine's recent strikes on Russian airbases.  In a post on X on Friday, Zelensky said that ""now is exactly the moment when America, Europe, and everyone around the world can stop this war together by pressuring Russia"". He made a thinly veiled reference to Trump's apparent unwillingness to put pressure on Russia. ""If someone is not applying pressure and is giving the war more time to take lives – that is complicity and accountability,"" Zelensky wrote. ""We must act decisively."" Zelensky said that ""as of now"", three deaths had been confirmed in the strikes - all employees of Ukraine's state emergency services. He said the attack used more than 400 drones and more than 40 missiles, and the number of people injured ""may increase"". In an earlier statement, Kyiv's Mayor Vitali Klitschko said four people had been killed in the country's capital. Air raid alerts were in place in Kyiv, where a residential building was hit, and the city's train system was disrupted after shelling damaged metro tracks. Tens of thousands of civilians in the capital spent a restless few hours in underground shelters. From the centre of the city, prolonged bursts of machine gun fire could be heard as air defences on the outskirts attempted to bring down scores of drones aimed at Kyiv.  From time to time, the distinctive buzz of drones overhead could also be heard. Bright flashes of light, sometimes reflected on nearby buildings, would be followed, five or ten seconds later, by thunderous explosions. Authorities say the attacks included 38 cruise missiles, which is the kind Ukraine targeted in Sunday's so-called ""Spider's Web"" operation, suggesting this attack could be a message from the Kremlin. The cities of Kharkiv, Sumy and Luhansk were also under air raid alerts. Elsewhere, Ternopil's military chief Vyacheslav Negoda said Friday's strike was the ""most massive air attack on our region to date"". Mayor of Ternopil, Igor Polishchuk, said five people were wounded in the attack and there was damage to homes, schools and a government facility. In Lutsk, five people were injured in an attack using 15 drones and six missiles, according to mayor Ihor Polishchuk.  Meanwhile, the Russian defence ministry said its air defences shot down 174 Ukrainian drones overnight in parts of Russia and occupied Crimea.  The ministry said Neptune anti-ship cruise missiles were also intercepted over the Black Sea.  Russia's latest attack on Ukraine comes days after Kyiv launched its biggest long-range drone strike on at least 40 Russian warplanes at four military bases. Zelensky said 117 drones were used in the Spider's Web operation by the SBU security service, striking ""34% of [Russia's] strategic cruise missile carriers"". Earlier this month, direct peace talks between Russia and Ukraine took place in Istanbul, but ended without a major breakthrough.  Ukrainian negotiators said Russia rejected an ""unconditional ceasefire"" - a key demand of Kyiv and its Western allies including the US. The Russian team said they had proposed a two-or three-day truce ""in certain areas"" of the vast front line, but gave no further details. Trump said Putin vowed to ""very strongly"" respond to Ukraine's recent attack on Russian airbases, during a phone call that lasted more than an hour on Wednesday.  Moscow had previously said that military options were ""on the table"" for its response to Ukraine's attack. Last week, Trump appeared to set a two-week deadline for Putin, threatening to change how the US is responding to Russia if he believed Putin was still ""tapping"" him along on peace efforts in Ukraine.

2025-06-06,Article,How bitter feud escalated - and what happens next,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/c3wd2215q08o,"What happens when the richest person and the most powerful politician have a knock-down, drag-out fight? The world is finding out – and it's not a pretty picture. Donald Trump and Elon Musk have two of the biggest megaphones, and they have now turned them on each other, as a disagreement has ballooned into a war of words. Trump has threatened Musk's voluminous business dealings with the federal government, which form the lifeblood of his SpaceX programme. ""The easiest way to save money in our budget, billions and billions of dollars, is to terminate Elon's governmental subsidies and contracts,"" Trump posted menacingly on his own social media website. If Trump turns the machinery of government against Musk, the tech billionaire will feel pain. Tesla's stock price plunged by 14% on Thursday. It's not a one-way street, however. After that volley, Musk called for Trump's impeachment and dared him to cut funding for his companies.  Musk also said he was accelerating the decommissioning of his Dragon spacecraft, which the US relies on to carry American astronauts and supplies to the International Space Station.  But hours later, he appeared to back down from that threat, saying in response to a post on X urging him to cool off: ""Good advice. Ok, we won't decommission Dragon."" Musk has near limitless resources to respond, including by funding insurgent challengers to Republicans in next year's elections and primaries. And late on Thursday afternoon, he said he was dropping the ""really big bomb"" – suggesting without evidence that Trump appears in unreleased files related to late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.  His press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, offered only a tepid pushback to Musk's allegations and accusations. ""This is an unfortunate episode from Elon, who is unhappy with the One Big Beautiful Bill because it does not include the policies he wanted,"" she said.  Musk may not win a fight against the whole of Trump's government, but he could exact a high political - and personal - price for Trump and the Republicans. Trump, perhaps aware of this, appeared to tamp down the heat a bit by the end of the day. He avoided commenting on Musk during a public appearance at a White House event and posted a message on Truth Social that said he didn't mind ""turning against him"", but wishes he had quit government service months ago.  He then pivoted to boosting of his ""big, beautiful"" tax and spending legislation. It's difficult to envision an easy walk-down after Thursday's heat, however. The feud started at a simmer last week, began bubbling on Wednesday and became a full-on boil on Thursday afternoon in the Oval Office. As new German Chancellor Friedrich Merz – the day's visitor – sat in awkward silence, the president sounded a bit like a spurned lover. He expressed surprise at Musk's criticism of his legislation. He pushed back against the notion that he would have lost last year's presidential election without Musk's hundreds of millions of dollars in support. And he said Musk was only changing his tune now because his car company, Tesla, will be hurt by the Republican push to end electric vehicle tax credits. Musk quickly took to his social media site, X, with a very Generation X response for his 220 million followers: ""Whatever"".  He said he didn't care about the car subsidies, and that he wanted to shrink the national debt, which he says is an existential threat to the nation. He insisted that Democrats would have prevailed in last year's election without his help. ""Such ingratitude,"" he told Trump. The billionaire then launched a series of extraordinary attacks throughout the afternoon, and the feud was on in earnest. Musk and Trump had formed a powerful but unlikely alliance, culminating in the tech billionaire having a key position of budget-slashing authority in the Trump administration. Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, or Doge, became one of the biggest stories of Trump's first 100 days, as it shuttered entire agencies and dismissed thousands of government workers. It wasn't long, however, before speculation began over when – and how - the two outsized personalities would ultimately fall out. For a while, it seemed like those predictions were off the mark. Trump stood by Musk even as the latter's popularity dropped, as he feuded with administration officials and as he became a liability in several key elections earlier this year.  Every time it appeared there would be a break, Musk would pop up in the Oval Office, or the Cabinet room or on the president's Air Force One flight to Mar-a-Lago. When Musk's 130 days as a ""special government employee"" ended last week, the two had a chummy Oval Office send-off, with a golden key to the White House and hints that Musk might someday return. It's safe to say that any invitation has been rescinded and the locks have been changed. ""Elon and I had a great relationship,"" Trump said on Thursday – a comment notable for its use of the past tense. There had been some thought that Trump's surprise announcement on Wednesday night of a new travel ban, additional sanctions on Harvard and a conspiracy-laced administration investigation of former President Joe Biden were all efforts to change the subject from Musk's criticism. The White House and its allies in Congress seemed careful not to further antagonise him after his earlier comments. Then Trump spoke out and… so much for that. Now the question is where the dispute goes next. Congressional Republicans could find it harder to keep their members behind Trump's bill with Musk providing rhetorical and, perhaps financial, air cover for those who break ranks. Trump has already threatened Musk's government contracts, but he could also take aim at his remaining Doge allies in the administration or reopen Biden-era investigations into Musk's business dealings. Everything at this point is on the table. Meanwhile, Democrats are on the sidelines, wondering how to respond. Few seem willing to welcome Musk, a former donor to their party, back into the fold. But there's also the old adage that the enemy of an enemy is a friend. ""It's a zero-sum game,"" Liam Kerr, a Democratic strategist, told Politico. ""Anything that he does that moves more toward Democrats hurts Republicans."" At the very least, Democrats seem happy to stand back and let the two men exchange blows.

2025-06-06,Article,Australian mushroom lunch cook tells trial meal was 'special',https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/c5y8e1l55kko,"An Australian woman accused of intentionally cooking a fatal mushroom lunch has told her trial she had wanted the beef Wellington meal to be ""special"". Erin Patterson has pleaded not guilty to murdering three people and attempting to kill another at her home in regional Victoria in July 2023.  The 50-year-old says it was a tragic accident, and that she never intended to hurt family members she loved. But prosecutors argue Ms Patterson put poisonous fungi into their food in a carefully crafted plot to kill them. On Friday, the court heard it was ""unusual"" for Ms Patterson to host such an event at her house, and she was quizzed about her relationships with her guests. Ms Patterson's in-laws, Don and Gail Patterson, both 70, along with Gail's sister Heather Wilkinson, 66, all fell ill and died days after the lunch. Heather's husband, local pastor Ian Wilkinson, was also hospitalised but recovered after coming out of a weeks-long induced coma. Simon Patterson, the accused's estranged spouse, had been invited too, but pulled out the day before. More than 50 prosecution witnesses have given evidence at the trial, which began six weeks ago, but Ms Patterson became the first for the defence when she took to the stand on Monday. On her second day of cross-examination on Friday, Ms Patterson told the court she accepted that invites to her house were rare, but said she'd arranged the occasion to discuss a health issue and wanted to make a nice meal for her relatives to thank them for their support. ""I wanted it to be special,"" Ms Patterson said. She has previously admitted she misled her guests into believing she may need cancer treatment, telling the jury she did so as a cover for weight-loss surgery she was planning to have but was too embarrassed to disclose. Prosecutor Nanette Rogers, however, put to her that there was no health issue to discuss, and that she had invited Simon and his relatives over to kill them. She had even prepared a spare toxic meal in case Mr Patterson changed his mind and came over, Dr Rogers suggested. Over and over this week, Ms Patterson has denied these allegations, often becoming emotional as she told the court she loved the lunch guests like her own family. She has also repeatedly told the court that she realised, in the days after the lunch, that the beef Wellington may have accidentally included dried mushrooms she had foraged, which were kept in a container with store-bought ones.  Lies to the police and health authorities about the source of the mushrooms and her decision to dispose of a food dehydrator were both because she was scared of being blamed for the guests' dire illnesses, she said. ""Surely if you had loved them, then you would have immediately notified the medical authorities?"" Dr Rogers asked. Ms Patterson said she didn't tell doctors about the possibility that wild mushrooms had been unintentionally included because the lunch guests were already getting treatment for death cap mushroom poisoning. ""Even after you were discharged from hospital you did not tell a single person that there may have been foraged mushroom used in the meal,"" Dr Rogers said. ""Instead you got up, you drove your children to school... and drove home. And then you got rid of the dehydrator."" ""Correct,"" Ms Patterson said. The court heard there'd been conflict between Ms Patterson and her husband, and Dr Rogers suggested the accused was still angry at her in-laws for taking their son's side. ""You had two faces,"" Dr Rogers said, after making Ms Patterson read aloud messages in which she is critical of both Simon Patterson and his parents. There was her ""public face"" of appearing to have a good relationship with Don and Gail, Dr Rogers said, and a ""private face"" which she showed in the messages. ""How you truly felt about Don and Gail was how you expressed it [there],"" she said. ""And that is how you really felt about Simon Patterson... you did not regard him as being a decent human being at his core, correct or incorrect?"" That was ""incorrect"", Ms Patterson replied, her head shaking and voice faltering. Ms Patterson's use of the iNaturalist website - which listed locations of death cap mushrooms in areas close to her home - was also scrutinised, with the accused repeatedly saying she couldn't clearly recall ever using the site. She will resume being cross examined next week. The trial, initially expected to take six weeks, is now expected to run for at least another fortnight, the judge has told the court.

2025-06-06,Article,'Underwater needle in a haystack' - how a diver found a 140-year-old shipwreck,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/czel8y3dxp5o,"The mystery of a maritime disaster has been solved after experts found a vessel that sank almost 140 years ago. Diver and explorer Dom Robinson identified the SS Nantes, off Plymouth, after examining the wreck site and finding crockery. Dr Harry Bennett, an expert in maritime history, said the dive team had found ""the underwater archaeological equivalent of a needle in a haystack"". Mr Robinson said solving the mystery ensured those who died were not forgotten. In November 1888, the SS Nantes, which was operated by the Cunard Steamship Company, collided with a German sailing vessel, the Theodor Ruger, said Dr Bennett. The crew spent ""several hours"" trying to save their ship, the honorary associate professor in history at the University of Plymouth said. ""They used mattresses to plug the gap which had opened up in the hull of the SS Nantes,"" he said. ""[The ship sank] with the loss of a substantial number of the crew. There were some 23-odd fatalities. There were three survivors."" Bodies from the wreckage washed ashore at Talland Bay and Looe, in Cornwall, and ""locals were confronted by this picture of horror, pieces of ship together with bodies,"" he said. Afterwards the ""wreck was essentially lost, obviously you're dealing in a period with no satellite navigation,"" said Dr Bennett. He added while the crew tried to save the ship it ""drifted for several hours, before it finally made its way to the bottom, sadly, with many of its crewmen on board"". He said the wreck was lost until a local dive team identified it in 2024. Mr Robinson, who has been diving for about 35 years, said he heard about the unidentified wreck from the UK Hydrographic Office. He said the wreck ""was clearly an early steamship when we got down there"" but ""at the end of my dive I found a broken piece of plate... I decided to bring it up to the surface [and] we found that had the Cunard Steamship crest on it"". ""It was then bingo, we've found it,"" he said.  Dr Bennett said it was identified by the build and dimensions of the wreck, the technology on board, the cargo and ""lastly and most telling, they find a plate on the back of which is stamped Cunard - this is a Cunard ship"". ""[It was] very methodical, very, very dedicated detective work,"" he said. Mr Robinson said: ""This was an awful tragedy. One of the things I like to think is by solving mysteries and telling those stories I'm ensuring that those people aren't forgotten."" Since the initial find, Mr Robinson said he had dived the wreck again and found a second piece of Cunard crockery, providing ""even more confirmation"". ""There are very few mysteries left to explore in this world,"" he said. ""As a normal human being like me, going in exploring shipwrecks and identifying shipwrecks, that is just something different to my normal life, and it's a fantastic feeling."" Dr Bennett said ""all the pieces fit and I think the local dive team are to be congratulated on a splendid piece of detective work which reveals this maritime disaster"".  He said he had looked at the footage and methodology and had confirmed they were right ""beyond any reasonable shadow of a doubt, this is the SS Nantes"".

2025-06-06,Article,Olly Alexander: I've come into a different space in my life,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/c4g3ele74l3o,"Singer and actor Olly Alexander has said he has ""come into a different space in my life"", as he announced a new West End stage role after recently parting ways with his record label. The star will appear in the National Theatre's production of The Importance of Being Earnest when it transfers to the West End in September. It will be his first acting role since It's A Sin, Channel 4's acclaimed 2021 drama about the Aids crisis, for which he was nominated for a Bafta Award. ""I'd recently been thinking that I'd love to act again,"" Alexander told BBC News. ""I'd come to the end of my record contract, and I have a bit more breathing space to try a few different things and not feel, oh, well I have to deliver an album to my record label."" He will take over from Doctor Who star Ncuti Gatwa, who starred in The Importance of Being Earnest when it opened at the National Theatre in 2024.  Alexander will play Algernon when the show moves to the Noel Coward Theatre in London, in collaboration with Sonia Friedman Productions.  ""What's not to love?"" he asked. ""It's such a brilliant play, Oscar Wilde's most celebrated comedy. I saw the National production and thought it was fantastic, and this opportunity came along and I jumped at the chance."" Alexander shot to fame when his band Years & Years won the BBC Sound of 2015 poll and went on to have hits such as King and Shine, and score a number one album. He later went solo, although continued to perform as Years & Years, and scored another top-charting album in 2021. He has performed with Sir Elton John and Kylie Minogue, and was the UK's Eurovision entrant last year. However, after his most recent album Polari, released in February, reached number 17, Alexander announced his departure from his record label. ""They aren't dropping me, they just aren't renewing my contract,"" he explained at the time. ""It's OK and honestly for the best. I've been on a pretty terrible deal for 10 years. It's time I do something new. But I'll still make music in the future."" Reflecting on his first decade as a pop star, Alexander told the BBC: ""With music, there's an intensity to the way I've been working and putting albums out, promoting and touring. I definitely want to take the foot off the gas in terms of that intensity.""  He still occasionally works on music, but has ""not been putting pressure on myself... I just do what feels good and feel very lucky that I have this other strand of acting that I'm able to explore"". Alexander said he felt he had ""learned so much"" over the last decade about the way he likes to work.  ""But for me,"" he continued, ""a lot of the reason I think the [music] industry has changed so much is that it's set on this model which is very antiquated now, and it's not kept pace with the times.  ""Lots of artists have this direct link with their audience via social media. They want their music out quickly. The whole model of promoting it - three singles into an album, then you tour the album, then move onto the next one - it's not really working like it did."" He noted that record labels could historically make an album a success because they were ""able to pour a lot of money into something"". ""They just can't do that now. Everything has changed. But I think that is exciting for lots of reasons, and it is an exciting place for artists, even though it's harder to break through.""  He concluded: ""If I go back into it, it'll be because I think it's fun and something I want to do, and not think too much about how it's going to perform.  ""That's pretty much how I try to always feel, but you're in an environment where you have a lot of other stakeholders, and people telling you it needs to be this or that, and there's always that tension."" For now, he is focusing on acting. First performed in 1895, The Importance of being Earnest follows two male friends who adopt fictional personas. The farcical comedy unfolds with mistaken identities and makes generous use of clever wordplay. ""In a nutshell, it's a comedy about two quite ridiculous young men and the double lives they lead,"" Alexander explained. ""They do that to avoid their social obligations, and they both invent these aliases called Ernest, while they try and woo and marry these two young women.  ""But really, it's a comedy that skewers society's expectations, makes fun of class and what society expects of us, and what roles we're expected to perform."" The previous production of the show, starring Gatwa, received a positive reception from critics.  ""There is an elegance to the nudge-wink references and it is a production with just the right amount of delightful mischief,"" wrote the Guardian's Arifa Akbar in a four-star review. The Daily Mail's Patrick Marmion awarded five stars, describing the ""sparkling new production"" as a ""witty reboot"". ""Yes, liberties are taken,"" he said. ""But that is surely the best way of blowing the dust off this national treasure."" In a three-star review, the Telegraph's Dominic Cavendish described the show as ""defiantly bold, but more playful than antagonistic"", although he added he wasn't sure the new iteration ""adds much"" to the original. In the play, nobody except Jack and Algernon know about their alter-egos - something which would be much more difficult to pull off now in an age of smartphones. ""It'd be impossible!"" Alexander laughed. ""Our every movement is captured, so there's less room to invent aliases and lead double lives, which in some circumstances is probably for the best.  ""What's brilliant about the play is it's set 100 years ago, at a time that feels so different to where we are now, but the themes are so timeless."" Alexander last appeared in the West End in 2013, before becoming famous as a pop star, with a relatively small role in Peter & Alice alongside Dame Judi Dench. In 2024, Alexander finished in 18th place at Eurovision with his track Dizzy, in a tricky year for the contest which was partly overshadowed by controversy surrounding Israel's participation. This year's entrants, girl group Remember Monday, ended in a similar position, finishing 19th. Alexander praised their performance, adding that he ""hopes to meet up with them soon and we can exchange stories"". ""But,"" he added, ""I think I'll still be processing and reflecting [on Eurovision] for a long time."" The singer is excited to be returning to the West End, not least because it will mean performing continuously in one venue. ""I spent a lot of my previous years moving around, touring, which is so fun and amazing,"" he reflects. ""But I also very much appreciate staying in one place now. ""Having a home in London with my partner, my cats, just trotting off to the theatre every night - that just sounds like the most wonderful existence."" Copyright 2025 BBC.

2025-06-06,Article,Judge temporarily blocks Trump's ban on foreign Harvard students ,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/c991lz2zd0ko,"A US judge has issued a temporary restraining order blocking the Trump administration from enforcing a ban the president ordered barring Harvard University from accepting international students.  The order by Judge Allison Burroughs, who is based in Massachusetts, said the oldest university in the US would face ""immediate and irreparable injury"" if the proclamation went into effect. It comes in response to a lawsuit filed by Harvard on Thursday accusing President Donald Trump of waging a ""government vendetta"" intended to stifle free speech. Trump has argued that the ban is necessary on national security grounds, and has accused Harvard of not doing enough to stop antisemitism on campus.  The federal judge's order comes only hours after Harvard amended an existing lawsuit against the US government, claiming that Trump's move is ""part of a concerted and escalating campaign of retaliation by the government in clear retribution for Harvard's exercising its First Amendment rights"" to free speech. Harvard President Alan Garber also issued a statement saying that the Ivy League school was developing contingency plans for international students in the event they are not able to travel to campus. The world's wealthiest university has been embroiled in a legal battle with the Trump administration after it froze billions of dollars of federal funding and accused the institution of failing to root out antisemitism on campus. In May, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem revoked certification Harvard needed to enrol foreign students on campus, a move that was swiftly blocked by a judge. The BBC has contacted the DHS for comment on the latest order. Another federal judge upheld that decision last week, saying she would issue a longer-term hold that would allow international students to continue their studies at Harvard while the legal battle plays out. The move triggered Trump's order on Wednesday, which suspended for an initial six months the entry of foreign students seeking to study or participate in exchange programmes at Harvard University. Trump's proclamation accused Harvard of developing ""extensive entanglements"" with foreign countries and continuing to ""flout the civil rights of its students and faculty"". For the 2024-2025 school year, Harvard enrolled nearly 7,000 foreign students, who made up 27% of its population. Copyright 2025 BBC.

2025-06-06,Article,Lululemon shares plunge as Trump tariffs bite,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/c8re86n23j5o,"Lululemon shares have plunged by more than 20% after it cut its annual profit forecast, as the company navigates tariffs and fears about the US economy slowing. ""We experienced lower store traffic in the Americas, partially reflective of economic uncertainty, inflationary pressures, lower consumer confidence, and changes in discretionary spending,"" Lululemon said in a statement. The athleisure brand joins a growing list of big companies to warn about the impact of US President Donald Trump's trade policies.  The Trump administration's approach to tariffs has triggered concerns over rising prices and a weakening economy. ""We are planning to take strategic price increases... on a small portion of our assortment, and they will be modest in nature,"" Lululemon's finance chief Meghan Frank said. The company also said it will cut costs and negotiate with its vendors. Last year, 40% of its products were made in Vietnam, and 28% of its fabrics came from mainland China. Clothing and footwear brands are among the businesses hit hardest by tariffs as they make goods in Asian countries, which have faced steep levies from the US. In April, sportswear giant Adidas warned that import taxes imposed by Trump will lead to higher prices in the US for popular trainers including the Gazelle and Samba. ""Since we currently cannot produce almost any of our products in the US, these higher tariffs will eventually cause higher costs for all our products for the US market,"" chief executive Bjorn Gulden said. Also in April, footwear maker Skechers withdrew its annual results forecast, citing economic uncertainty. ""The current environment is simply too dynamic from which to plan results with a reasonable assurance of success,"" Skechers' chief operating officer, David Weinberg, told investors in a post-earnings call. Last month, Nike said it would raise prices on some trainers and clothing in the US from early June. The sportswear giant did not name US tariffs explicitly as a reason for the increase, saying it regularly made ""price adjustments"". Copyright 2025 BBC.

2025-06-06,Article,Beyoncé dazzles on first night of London residency after slow ticket sales,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/cvgvlxk01gvo,"Beyoncé signed off the first night of her London residency by telling fans she was ""blessed"" to get to do what she loves by performing on stage. She stormed through a seven-act set at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, treating the audience to a spectacle that lasted just shy of three hours. But despite this being the first opportunity for fans to enjoy the singer's country era in person, slow ticket sales and high prices have been the hot topic around the tour. Promoters slashed some ticket prices in the run-up to shows in a bid to fill the stadium, prompting some of those who bought seats in advance to feel short-changed. Beyoncé's rodeo rumbled into London, bringing with it every country cliché you could think of - cowboy hats, horseshoes, tassels and even a gold mechanical bull. The 40-song setlist relied heavily on tracks from 2024's Cowboy Carter, which was met with critical acclaim, including taking the top album prize at this year's Grammy Awards. Every element of the performance was flawless, from the 43-year-old superstar's stunning array of costume changes (each one featuring more rhinestones than the last) to the seamless transitions between songs and musical themes. Much of the talk around the US leg of this tour, which took place in April and May, was the inclusion of Beyoncé and Jay-Z's 13-year-old daughter Blue Ivy. She made several appearances throughout the show, earning thunderous applause whilst dancing to an instrumental performance of her mum's 2006 hit Deja Vu. The teenager certainly seemed to enjoy her moment in the spotlight, unlike her younger sister, Rumi, who came on stage during Protector, shyly mouthing the words whilst being held by Beyoncé.  The show, which is called The Cowboy Carter and the Rodeo Chitlin' Circuit Tour as a way of referencing black performers that were segregated from the country scene, often paid homage in its interludes to these artists. Beyoncé herself previously hinted about being rejected from the country music world in the past and throughout the performance it felt like she was wrestling with this idea. She blended some of her biggest hits into Cowboy Carter tracks, such as Freedom and Diva, almost to prove that she belonged in this space. Thursday night's performance certainly showed she is more than qualified to be a country singer, but perhaps that a 60,000 seater stadium is not the best arena for it. As the night drew darker, Beyoncé delivered an act comprised of tracks from her house-inspired album Renaissance, which immediately lifted the crowd into a party mood. LED wristbands lit up in array of colours as she belted out Alien Superstar and I'm That Girl - which certainly got the best reaction from fans of the night. Similarly a section of old classics such as Crazy In Love and Irreplaceable had the crowd singing every word, proving perhaps that a few more classics wouldn't have gone amiss. With crowds on their feet, it was difficult to see how sold out the stadium actually was, but with just hours to go until the show there were still thousands of tickets available for sale online. Despite the tour only stopping in two European cities - London and Paris - the remaining eight dates are not sold out. Beyoncé's tour has the highest top-priced ticket of any artist visiting the UK in 2025 at £950, with the cheapest costing £71. Some seats that were sold in the Beyhive fan presale for £620 excluding fees are next to seats that were available this week for £141.60, also without fees. Zulkarnain Sadali flew from Singapore to London to watch Beyoncé perform live and bought a ticket in the pre-sale, which he said cost him ""more than £700"". ""A couple of weeks ago I checked my ticket and then curiosity got the best of me and I checked the same ticket, or same category, and the price was around £300,"" he told the BBC. ""I'm really excited for [the show] but I will say the dynamic pricing really left a sour taste in my mouth."" Another fan, Holly Whiteman, said she ""panic bought"" Beyoncé tickets in a fan pre-sale on Ticketmaster, which were ""way up in the nosebleeds"" and cost £170 each, when she had initially set a budget of £100. ""Fast forward a few days later, the tickets went on general sale through Tottenham Hotspur and I found tickets for the same show in both the same row and the same section for a much cheaper price,"" she told the BBC. ""I believe they were at least £50-£70 cheaper per ticket."" Sadali said that despite feeling short-changed, it had not dented his excitement for the tour. ""It's really about the Beyoncé experience, you're not gonna get it anywhere else and I know this sounds like a contradiction, it's worth every cent,"" he said. Whiteman said the process had left her a bit ""disappointed"", but she was still looking forward to the tour. A Ticketmaster spokesperson told the BBC they do ""not use surge pricing or dynamic algorithms to adjust ticket prices"", adding that event organisers are responsible for the pricing structures. ""Since tickets typically go on sale at least 3-6 months before the event, organisers may review prices at key points leading up to the show, but they make any adjustments, not an algorithm,"" they also added. The BBC also contacted tour promoter Live Nation for comment. Ticketing expert Reg Walker put the lack of sold-out shows down to several factors, including ""overexposure"" after her last UK stadium tour, which played five nights at the same venue in 2023. And the ticket prices are ""eye-watering"", he told the BBC. ""You might be able to afford to go to one of her concerts where you're effectively paying, in some categories, the same amount of money as a small holiday, but you can't do that on consecutive years. ""The pricing strategy on tickets was clearly far too high,"" he added. Walker said there were a lot of ""affordably priced"" tours coming up - but with so many artists visiting the UK this summer, fans may be picking and choosing who they pay to go and see. Billie Eilish, Lana Del Rey, Dua Lipa, Kendrick Lamar and SZA are all embarking on stadium tours over the coming months, with Olivia Rodrigo, Sabrina Carpenter, Chapell Roan and Drake headlining festivals.

2025-06-06,Article,The long wait for answers over the Lockerbie bombing grows longer,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/c3v52yw335xo,"Major television productions are bringing the story of the Lockerbie bombing to a new global audience, but the real life drama of the trial of a new Libyan suspect has been delayed once more. Abu Agila Mohammed Mas'ud Kheir al-Marimi, known as Masud, had been due to face a Washington jury last month, accused of making the bomb that destroyed Pan Am Flight 103 and killed 270 people. The 12 May starting date was abandoned because of problems with his health and the complexity of the case, and the trial is now scheduled to start in April, 2026.. The date was set at the District of Columbia District Court, where Masud listened with the help of a translator and was expressionless throughout. After the hearing, relatives of American victims of the bombing told BBC News of their disappointment that the trial is now scheduled to start 50 weeks later than originally planned. Kara Weipz is the president of the US group Victims of Pan Am Flight 103 and lost her 20-year-old brother Richard Monetti on the plane. ""I'm just going to pray that it stays at 20 April,"" she said. ""I was 15 when this happened, and I'm 52 now and among the relatives I'm considered young. ""A lot of our family members are in their seventies and eighties and unfortunately, we lose them weekly or monthly now. ""The travesty in all of this that they're not seeing the justice that they've worked 37 years to see. ""That's what concerns us the most, that this trial will come around and we'll have lost more family members."" Victoria Cummock's husband John was coming home from a business trip to Europe a day earlier than planned, to surprise his family. The founder of the Pan Am 103 Lockerbie Legacy Foundation, Mrs Cummock said: ""We've lived through 36 years of delays and postponements simply because this is an international case filled with politics. ""Thirty six years with seven different administrations in America have really collided with the families' search for accountability and justice. ""It's no surprise that our mission to hold them to account is being delayed."" Mrs Cummock added she was concerned that President Trump's ban on Libyan citizens travelling to the US could affect the trial. She said: ""It just seems like it's a very slow journey to getting this case started."" Masud has been in US custody since December 2022 and has pled not guilty to the charges. The Tunisian-born Libyan is in his seventies and is understood to have diabetes and heart problems. His family in Libya has already expressed concerns over the delays to the case, saying he's an innocent man. The new trial date was fixed after a joint motion submitted by the prosecution and the defence, both of whom raised the international nature of the evidence and witnesses. A series of crucial legal arguments will have to be resolved before the trial can go ahead, with the judge Dabney Friedrich describing the 20 April date as ""tentative."" Those will include the admissibility of a confession Masud is alleged to have made while in custody in 2012, following the collapse of Colonel Gaddafi's regime. Another complication is the fact that new information on the case is still emerging, almost four decades after the attack. A book published in France revealed the existence of documents said to have been retrieved from the archives of the Libyan intelligence service, of which Masud is alleged to have been a member. If proved genuine, those documents detail his involvement in preparations for the attack on Pan Am 103. It's more than 24 years since the first Lockerbie trial, when three Scottish judges convicted Libyan intelligence agent Abdulbasset al-Megrahi of playing a key role in the plot. Megrahi was jailed for life but released on compassionate grounds by the Scottish government in 2009 after he was diagnosed with terminal cancer. He died three years later at home in Tripoli. His release infuriated many of the American relatives, which is why they have set so much store on the trial of Masud, the first suspect to face an American court over Lockerbie. They believe it will deliver the justice they were denied by the Scottish legal system. The bombing remains the worst terror attack in British history and claimed the lives of 43 UK citizens. Some, but not all, of the British relatives have never accepted the verdict against Megrahi, including the Rev John Mosey, whose daughter Helga was on the plane. ""I think they're just waiting for people like me to pop our clogs and get out of the way,"" he said. ""I'm still pretty cynical about the whole thing. I would like to be proved wrong but I can't see it happening. ""As far as I'm concerned, who made the bomb and who put in on the plane are secondary as to who were the main criminals. ""They were the group of people who had all the warnings that this was going to happen and warned their own people but didn't warn the public."" The big budget television dramas may have pushed the Lockerbie bombing back into the public eye but it's clear that there's a very long way to go before a jury delivers its verdict on Masud. Judge Friedrich warned that if things are not done in a timely manner, there's a risk the trial could ""slip"" into 2027. As she reminded everyone in the court: ""This isn't a normal criminal case.""

2025-06-06,Article,Lululemon shares plunge as Trump tariffs bite,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/c8re86n23j5o,"Lululemon shares have plunged by more than 20% after it cut its annual profit forecast, as the company navigates tariffs and fears about the US economy slowing. ""We experienced lower store traffic in the Americas, partially reflective of economic uncertainty, inflationary pressures, lower consumer confidence, and changes in discretionary spending,"" Lululemon said in a statement. The athleisure brand joins a growing list of big companies to warn about the impact of US President Donald Trump's trade policies.  The Trump administration's approach to tariffs has triggered concerns over rising prices and a weakening economy. ""We are planning to take strategic price increases... on a small portion of our assortment, and they will be modest in nature,"" Lululemon's finance chief Meghan Frank said. The company also said it will cut costs and negotiate with its vendors. Last year, 40% of its products were made in Vietnam, and 28% of its fabrics came from mainland China. Clothing and footwear brands are among the businesses hit hardest by tariffs as they make goods in Asian countries, which have faced steep levies from the US. In April, sportswear giant Adidas warned that import taxes imposed by Trump will lead to higher prices in the US for popular trainers including the Gazelle and Samba. ""Since we currently cannot produce almost any of our products in the US, these higher tariffs will eventually cause higher costs for all our products for the US market,"" chief executive Bjorn Gulden said. Also in April, footwear maker Skechers withdrew its annual results forecast, citing economic uncertainty. ""The current environment is simply too dynamic from which to plan results with a reasonable assurance of success,"" Skechers' chief operating officer, David Weinberg, told investors in a post-earnings call. Last month, Nike said it would raise prices on some trainers and clothing in the US from early June. The sportswear giant did not name US tariffs explicitly as a reason for the increase, saying it regularly made ""price adjustments"". Copyright 2025 BBC.
