2025-06-05,Article,Trump and Musk enter bitter feud - and Washington buckles up,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/c3wd2215q08o,"What happens when the richest person and the most powerful politician have a knock-down, drag-out fight? The world may be about to find out. A disagreement between Elon Musk and Donald Trump started at a simmer last week, began bubbling on Wednesday and is now in full-on boil. And like everything these two men do, it is all spilling out into public view. These two men have two of the world's biggest megaphones, and they clearly enjoy using them. In remarks at the Oval Office on Thursday afternoon, Trump sounded a bit like a spurned lover. He expressed surprise at Musk's criticism of his ""big, beautiful"" tax and spending legislation. He pushed back against the notion that he would have lost last year's presidential election without Musk's hundreds of millions of dollars in support. And he said Musk was only changing his tune now because his car company, Tesla, will be hurt by the Republican push to end electric vehicle tax credits. Musk took to his social media site, X, with a very Generation X response for his 220 million followers: ""Whatever"". He said he didn't care about the car subsidies, he wanted to shrink the national debt, which he says is an existential threat to the nation. He called Trump ""ungrateful"" for his help last year and insisted that Democrats would have prevailed without him. Musk and Trump had formed a powerful but unlikely alliance , culminating in the tech billionaire having a key position of budget-slashing authority in the Trump administration. Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, or Doge, became one of the biggest stories of Trump's first 100 days, as it shuttered entire agencies and dismissed thousands of government workers. It wasn't long, however, before speculation began over when – and how - the two outsized personalities would ultimately fall out. For a while, it seemed like those predictions were off the mark. Trump stood by Musk even as the latter's popularity dropped, as he feuded with administration officials and as he became a liability in several key elections earlier this year. Every time it appeared there would be a break, Musk would pop up in the Oval Office, or the Cabinet room or on the president's Air Force One flight to Mar-a-Lago. When Musk's 130 days as a ""special government employee"" ended last week, the two had a chummy Oval Office send-off, with a golden key to the White House and hints that Musk might someday return. It's safe to say that any invitation has been rescinded and the locks have been changed. ""Elon and I had a great relationship,"" Trump said on Thursday – a comment notable for its use of the past tense. There had been some thought that Trump's surprise announcement on Wednesday night of a new travel ban, additional sanctions on Harvard and a conspiracy-laced administration investigation of former President Joe Biden were all efforts to change the subject from Musk's criticism. The White House and its allies in Congress seemed careful not to further antagonise him after his earlier comments. Then Trump spoke out and … so much for that. Now the question is where the dispute goes next. Congressional Republicans could find it harder to keep their members behind Trump's bill with Musk providing rhetorical – and, perhaps financial – air for those who break ranks.  Trump, who takes pride in being a devastating counterpuncher, will have plenty of opportunity to lay into Musk. What will happen to Musk's Doge allies still in the Trump administration or government contracts to Musk-related companies or Biden-era investigations into Musk's business dealings? ""The easiest way to save money in our budget, billions and billions of dollars, is to terminate Elon's governmental subsidies and contracts,"" Trump posted menacingly on his own social media website. If Trump turns the machinery of government against Musk, the tech billionaire will feel pain. Tesla's stock price slipped on Thursday.  But Musk also has near limitless resources to respond, including by funding insurgent challengers to Republicans in next year's elections and primaries. He may not win a fight against the whole of Trump's government, but he could exact a high political price. Meanwhile, Democrats are on the sidelines, wondering how to respond. Few seem willing to welcome Musk, a former donor to their party, back into the fold. But there's also the old adage that the enemy of an enemy is a friend. ""It's a zero-sum game,"" Liam Kerr, a Democratic strategist, told Politico. ""Anything that he does that moves more toward Democrats hurts Republicans."" At the very least, Democrats seem happy to stand back and let the two men exchange blows. And until they abandon this fight, the din is likely to drown out everything else in American politics. But don't expect this spat to end anytime soon. ""Trump has 3.5 years left as president,"" Musk wrote on X, ""but I will be around for 40-plus years."" Copyright 2025 BBC.

2025-06-05,Article,"Trump's new ban dodges pitfalls faced by last attempt, experts say",https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/cd7gp8l1241o,"US President Donald Trump has issued a sweeping new travel ban for people from 12 countries, revisiting a hallmark policy of his first term in office. There are some key differences, however. The original travel ban suffered a series of legal defeats. This time, the policy appears to have been designed to avoid the same pitfalls. Its predecessor, which targeted seven predominantly Muslim countries and was dubbed the ""Muslim ban"" by critics, was ordered just a week after Trump took office in 2017, during his first term in the White House. The ban was amended twice to overcome court challenges, after opponents argued it was unconstitutional and illegal because it discriminated against travellers based on their religion. A scaled-back version was eventually upheld by the US Supreme Court in 2018, which this new ban closely resembles. Legal experts told the BBC that it appeared Trump had learned lessons from his first attempt. Christi Jackson, an expert in US immigration law at the London firm Laura Devine Immigration, said the new ban was more legally robust as a result. While the first lacked ""clarity"", the new restrictions were ""wider in scope"" and had ""clearly defined"" exemptions, she said. While there are some similarities in the nations chosen by the 2017 ban and the 2025 ban, Muslim-majority states are not the express target of the latest order. Barbara McQuade, professor of law at the University of Michigan and former US attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan, told the BBC World Service's Newshour programme that, on this basis, it seemed likely to win the approval of the Supreme Court if it was ever referred up to that level. The 12 countries subject to the harshest restrictions from 9 June are mainly in the Middle East, Africa and the Caribbean, including Afghanistan, Iran and Somalia. There will be partial restrictions on travellers from another seven countries, including Cuban and Venezuelan nationals. Trump said the strength of the restrictions would be graded against the severity of the perceived threat, including from terrorism. But besides Iran, none of the 12 countries hit by the outright ban are named on the US government's state sponsors of terrorism list. Trump cited Sunday's incident in Boulder, Colorado, in which a man was accused of throwing Molotov cocktails at demonstrators attending a march for Israeli hostages, in a video announcing the ban on X. The alleged attacker was an Egyptian national. However, Egypt does not appear on either list.  Trump also specified high rates of people overstaying their visas as a reason for listing certain countries. However, Steven D Heller, an immigration lawyer based in the US, said there was a ""lack of clarity"" over what threshold had to be met by a country's overstaying rate in order for that country to be placed on Trump's ban list. That could be the basis for a successful legal challenge, he suggested. ""If they're relying on this notion of excessive overstay rates... they have to define what that actually means,"" he told the BBC. But he noted that existing US law gave the president broad powers over immigration policy. Unlike the first ban, which was to last for only 90 to 120 days, today's order has no end date. It has been met with dismay in the targeted countries.  Venezuela has described the Trump administration as ""supremacists who think they own the world"", though Somalia has pledged to ""engage in dialogue to address the concerns raised"". The original ban spurred mass protests and sowed chaos at US airports.  It was repealed in 2021 by Trump's successor, President Joe Biden, who called the policy ""a stain on our national conscience"". Immigration lawyer Shabnam Lotfi, who challenged the previous travel ban, said it would be an ""uphill battle"" to overturn the new one.  ""The president does have the authority to determine who is admissible to the US,"" she said, adding that because of the way the ban had been written, it was ""harder to find a huge group of people that could file a class-action lawsuit"". ""They've put more thought into it."" Ms Lotfi noted that the new restrictions could have consequences for students and other visa applicants abroad. ""Students who are stuck in administrative processing are impacted. So are winners of the diversity visa lottery who paid fees and went to interviews - they're unlikely to get visas now,"" she said. ""Even EB-5 investors - people who've put over $1 million into the US economy - are affected. And H-1B visa holders stuck abroad, waiting to return to their US employers, could also be blocked.""

2025-06-05,Article,Supreme Court rules for heterosexual woman in discrimination case,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/cr7zlr1rdpdo,"The US Supreme Court has sided with an Ohio woman who alleged she was discriminated against at her job because she was heterosexual. The justices voted unanimously in a ruling focused on evidence standards that could make it easier to file similar ""reverse discrimination"" cases.  Marlean Ames said that despite working for the Ohio Department of Youth Services for more than 20 years, she was denied a promotion and then demoted. She had appealed to the court to challenge the standards required to prove her case. The decision effectively lowers the burden of proof required for people who are members of a majority group - such as white or heterosexual people - to make discrimination claims. US court precedent covering some states, including Ohio, had required that members of majority groups show additional ""background circumstances"" to prove their case or evidence showing a pattern of discrimination.  The court has now ruled that the standard of evidence for a discrimination claim should be the same, regardless of a person's identity. Justice Kentaji Brown Jackson, one of the court's liberals, wrote the official opinion, with concurring opinions from conservatives Justice Clarence Thomas and Justice Neil Gorsuch.  The court concluded that anti-discrimination and equal protection laws were meant to apply to all Americans. ""By establishing the same protections for every 'individual'—without regard to that individual's membership in a minority or majority group—Congress left no room for courts to impose special requirements on majority-group plaintiffs alone,"" she wrote. The court did not consider Ms Ames' original discrimination suit. The justices said it was up to lower courts that had initially ruled against her to evaluate the case under the clarified evidence standards.  Legal experts say employment discrimination and bias cases can be difficult to demonstrate, regardless of the burden of proof. Ms Ames had said she had positive performance reviews, but a promotion she sought was given to a lesbian. She was then demoted and her job was given to a gay man.  In a lawsuit, she argued her employer had a preference for LGBTQ staff members and denied her opportunities because she identifies as straight. Lower courts ruled that she had failed to provide sufficient evidence of her claim, propelling the burden of proof question to the Supreme Court.  At a February hearing, justices on both sides ideologically appeared sympathetic to her argument. Copyright 2025 BBC.

2025-06-05,Article,Why are these 12 countries on Trump's travel-ban list?,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/cz6329yvwdvo,"A travel ban issued on Wednesday by US President Donald Trump is set to primarily affect countries in Africa and the Middle East.  Twelve countries face full bans, which will come into force on Monday. People from a further seven nations are facing partial restrictions.  Trump has depicted it as a matter of national security. He cited a recent attack on members of Colorado's Jewish community, which was allegedly carried out by an Egyptian national. Egypt itself is not on the banned list. Other reasons cited include alleged breaking of US visa rules by people from the countries in question. Here is a closer look at some of the president's reasoning. A range of accusations have been made against Afghanistan in a presidential proclamation signed by Trump. The document highlights that the Taliban, which controls the country, is a Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT) group.  The move comes just weeks after the Trump administration appeared to signal that it believed the situation had improved in Afghanistan, when it announced the end of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Afghans living in the US. Afghanistan is further accused by Trump of lacking a ""competent or co-operative"" central authority for issuing passports or civil documents. As with other countries on Trump's list, the issue of Afghan nationals overstaying their visas is also cited. Trump's proclamation identifies Iran as a state sponsor of terrorism - a longstanding charge that the Middle Eastern nation has previously rejected.  The US has previously censured Tehran, Iran's capital, for its alleged sponsorship of proxy groups operating in the region, such as Hamas and Hezbollah. The new proclamation from Trump says the country is ""the source of significant terrorism around the world"", does not co-operate with the US on security risks and has ""historically failed to accept back its removable nationals"". The move comes amid diplomatic wrangling between the two sides over the creation of a new deal over Iran's nuclear weapon-building capabilities. Similar reasons are given in the case of Somalia. The east African country is branded by Trump as a ""terrorist safe haven"".  Like Iran, it is also accused of failing to accept its nationals when removed from the US. However, a further point was made by Trump: ""Somalia stands apart from other countries in the degree to which its government lacks command and control of its territory, which greatly limits the effectiveness of its national capabilities in a variety of respects."" Somalia's internationally-based government faces a significant challenge from armed Islamists. It has pledged to ""engage in dialogue to address the concerns raised"" by Trump. Libya, in north Africa, is cited for its ""historical terrorist presence"", which is painted as a security threat to Americans. Libya and Somalia are also among the countries on Trump's list which have been criticised for their perceived incompetence at issuing passports. The document highlights that ""hundreds of thousands of illegal Haitian aliens flooded into the United States during the Biden Administration"".  Trump points to various perceived risks that this has entailed - including the creation of ""criminal networks"" and high visa overstay rates. Data from the US Census Bureau suggested more than 852,000 Haitians were living in the US in February 2024, though it does not give a breakdown of when those migrants arrived.  Many came after a devastating earthquake in 2010, or after fleeing gang violence that took hold in the Caribbean nation. The US president also points to a lack of central authority in Haiti for matters including law enforcement.  These countries are solely accused by Trump of having relatively high visa overstay rates.  The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) defines an ""overstay"" as a person who remains in the US beyond their authorised period of admission, with no evidence of any extension. The ""rate"" signals the proportion of people who overstayed. The central African nation Chad is singled out for showing a ""a blatant disregard for United States immigration laws"".  The document highlights an overstay rate of 49.54% by Chadians on business or tourist visas in 2023, citing a DHS report. Congo-Brazzaville and Equatorial Guinea have equivalent rates of 29.63% and 21.98% respectively. But these rates are lower than Laos, which faces a lesser restriction.  Myanmar - referred to as Burma in the Trump proclamation - is similarly accused of a high visa overstay rates.  As with others on the list, including Iran, the country is further accused of not co-operating with the US to accept deported Burmese nationals. For each of these countries, the first allegation made by Trump is that they have questionable competence at issuing passports and civil documents.  Eritrea and Sudan are further accused of having relatively high visa overstay rates. Eritrea is also blamed for failing to make the criminal records of its national available to the US, and of refusing to accept deported nationals. As with Somalia, Yemen is also accused of lacking control over its own land. Trump's proclamation highlights that it is the site of active US military operations. The US has been combating Houthis, who have seized much of the north and west of the country during an ongoing civil war.

2025-06-05,Article,Chad halts US visas in revenge for Trump travel ban,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/cyvm2j32pvmo,"The central African nation of Chad says it is suspending all visas to US citizens as a matter of ""reciprocity"", after learning that it is one of a dozen countries whose nationals are banned from travelling to the US. ""Chad has neither planes to offer nor billions of dollars to give, but Chad has its dignity and pride,"" continued President Mahamat Idriss Déby Itno in a Facebook post (in French) on Thursday. Africa is the continent worst affected by the travel ban announced by US President Donald Trump, with seven of the 12 countries on the list. It is set to come into effect on Monday. The order prohibits people from Chad, Congo-Brazzaville, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Libya, Somalia and Sudan - as well as Afghanistan, Myanmar, Haiti, Iran and Yemen - from entering the US. In addition, there will be travel restrictions on nationals of Burundi, Sierra Leone, Togo, Cuba, Laos, Turkmenistan and Venezuela - they will no longer be able to travel to the US on certain visas. ""We will not allow people to enter our country who wish to do us harm,"" Trump said in a video posted on X.  The US president said the list could be revised if ""material improvements"" were made and additional countries could be added as ""threats emerge around the world"". The White House said these ""common-sense restrictions"" would ""protect Americans from dangerous foreign actors"". Somalia was quick to react to the travel ban, immediately pledging to work with the US to address any security issues. In a statement, Somali ambassador to the US, Dahir Hassan Abdi, said his country ""values its longstanding relationship"" with America. Chad did not disguise its dismay, and in addition to the president's stern words, its Foreign Minister Abdoulaye Sabre Fadoul told the AFP news agency his government was ""surprised by this announcement and even more by the terrorism-related reason [which] completely disregards Chad's commitment and results in this area"". The African Union said it was ""concerned about the potential negative impact"" of the measures and called on the US to adopt ""a more consultative approach... with the countries concerned."" BBC Tigrinya has spoken to several Eritreans who are alarmed by the ban. ""As Eritreans, we've already suffered under our regime at home and now we're facing the same hardship under Trump's immigration policies. We've endured so much pain,"" one man told the BBC on condition of anonymity.  Eritrea is a one-party state where President Isaias Afwerki has been in power since it won independence from Ethiopia in 1993 after a bitter 30-year struggle. Young Eritreans are subject to compulsory military service, prompting many thousands to flee the country and seek refuge elsewhere. Another Eritrean woman said she worried that she and her children would no longer be able to join her husband who is already living in the US. ""We've waited so long and done everything legally, but now we're left in limbo. No-one is giving us clear answers,"" she told the BBC. In a video posted to his Truth Social website, Trump said the recent alleged terror attack in Boulder, Colorado ""underscored the extreme dangers"" posed by foreign nationals who had not been ""properly vetted"". However, the suspect in that attack is an Egyptian national and Egypt is not one of the affected countries. According to the White House explanation of the travel ban, countries such as Libya, Somalia and Sudan lack competent authorities to issue passports or civil documents and conduct ""appropriate screening measures"". All three are currently embroiled in civil wars. In addition, the White House said: ""A persistent terrorist threat also emanates from Somalia's territory"" and there was a ""historical terrorist presence within Libya's territory"". The other African countries affected had high rates of people overstaying their visas, ranging from 15% in Togo to 70% for some types of visa for nationals of Equatorial Guinea.  The ban takes effect on 9 June, a cushion that avoids the chaos that unfolded at airports nationwide when a similar measure took effect with virtually no notice eight years ago. Visas issued before that date will not be revoked, the order said. There will be exemptions for dual nationals and athletes in major sporting events such as the 2026 men's football World Cup and the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. The travel ban fulfils a promise Trump made during his 2024 election campaign but is likely to be challenged in court.  He signed a similar order in 2017, during his first term in office. It featured some of the same countries as his latest order, including Libya, Somalia and Iran. Critics called that a ""Muslim ban"" as the seven countries initially listed were Muslim majority. The White House revised the policy, ultimately adding two non-Muslim majority countries, North Korea and Venezuela. This was upheld by the Supreme Court in 2018. President Joe Biden, who succeeded Trump, repealed the ban in 2021, calling it ""a stain on our national conscience"".

2025-06-05,Article,What we know about Trump's latest travel ban,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/cx271g270v7o,"Donald Trump has signed a ban on travel to the US from 12 countries, citing national security risks. There are also seven additional countries whose nationals will face partial travel restrictions. The US president said the list could be revised if ""material improvements"" were made, while other countries could be added as ""threats emerge around the world"".  It is the second time he has ordered a ban on travel from certain countries. He signed a similar order in 2017 during his first term in office. Trump has signed a proclamation banning travel to the US from nationals of 12 countries: Nationals from these countries will not be allowed to enter the US unless they qualify for an exemption.  There are an additional seven countries whose nationals face partial travel restrictions:  Those under the partial restrictions will not be able to travel to the US with certain visas. The ban takes effect on Monday at 00:01 EDT (04:01 GMT), a cushion that avoids the chaos that unfolded at US airports when a similar measure took effect with virtually no notice eight years ago.  No end date has been provided. The order calls for periodic review. The White House said these ""common sense restrictions"" would ""protect Americans from dangerous foreign actors"". In a video posted to his Truth Social website, Trump said the recent alleged terror attack in Boulder, Colorado ""underscored the extreme dangers"" posed by foreign nationals who had not been ""properly vetted"". Twelve people were injured in Colorado on Sunday when a man attacked a group gathering in support of Israeli hostages, throwing two incendiary devices and using a makeshift flamethrower. The man accused of carrying out the attack has been identified as an Egyptian national, but Egypt is not included on the list of banned countries. Trump has close ties with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who has in the past been described by the US president as his ""favourite dictator"". Only two of the 19 countries are on the US government's State Sponsors of Terrorism list - Iran, which has a full ban, and Cuba, which faces partial travel restrictions. But national security is given as a partial reason for the choices. In the proclamation, Trump said many of the countries listed have a ""historic failure to accept back their removable nationals"" from the US, as well as having ""taken advantage"" of the US by exploiting its visa system. He added that nationals from certain countries also ""pose significant risks"" of overstaying their visas. There are a number of people from affected countries who may still be able to enter the US due to a number of exceptions. The order does not apply to:  In addition, the US Secretary of State may grant exemptions to individuals on a ""case-by-case"" basis, if ""the individual would serve a United States national interest"". Trump's latest order, which is expected to face legal challenges, drew a swift response, at home and abroad.  Chad has retaliated by suspending all visas to US citizens, with President Mahamat Idriss Déby Itno saying the country ""has its dignity and pride"". Somalia promised to work with the US to address any security issues, with ambassador to the US, Dahir Hassan Abdi, saying his country ""values its longstanding relationship"" with the US.  Venezuela's Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello warned that ""being in the United States is a great risk for anyone, not just for Venezuelans"". The African Union, which represents all 55 countries on the continent, called on the US to ""engage in constructive dialogue with the countries concerned"".   It appealed to the US to exercise its right to protect its borders and its citizens' security ""in a manner that is balanced, evidence-based, and reflective of the long-standing partnership between the United States and Africa"". The union said it remained concerned about the ""potential negative impact of such measures"". The UN's human rights chief, Volker Turk, said the ban ""raises concerns from the perspective of international law"" ""The broad and sweeping nature of the new travel ban raises concerns from the perspective of international law,"" Volker Turk said in a statement. That included ""the principle of non-discrimination and of the necessity and proportionality of the measures deployed to meet the security concerns stated"", he told news agency AFP. In the US, Democrats were quick to condemn the move. ""This ban, expanded from Trump's Muslim ban in his first term, will only further isolate us on the world stage,"" Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal wrote on social media. Congressman Don Beyer said Trump had ""betrayed"" the ideals of the founders of the US. Human rights organisation Amnesty International USA described it as ""discriminatory, racist, and downright cruel"", while the US-based Human Rights First called it ""yet another anti-immigrant and punitive action taken"" by the president. But others support the ban. Congressman Clay Higgins of Louisiana said travel to the US was ""a privilege, not a right"".  He claimed on BBC Radio's Today programme that Americans had ""had enough of immigrants coming to our country, violating our laws and committing violence among our people"". Greg Swenson, chairman of Republicans Overseas UK, said the list of countries subject to the travel ban proves the White House is using a ""common sense policy"", but expressed suprise that Egypt had not been included. ""I think what the president has decided was that Egypt, despite having one particular incident from an illegal migrant, might have some policies that are in place which are better than other countries,"" he said. Trump's original ban took place in 2017, during his first White House term, and featured some of the same countries as his latest order, including Iran, Libya and Somalia.   Critics called it a ""Muslim ban"" as the seven countries initially listed were Muslim majority, and it was immediately challenged in courts across the US. The White House revised the policy, ultimately adding two non-Muslim majority countries, North Korea and Venezuela. It was upheld by the US Supreme Court in 2018. Joe Biden, who succeeded Trump as US president, repealed the ban in 2021, calling it ""a stain on our national conscience"". US immigration law expert Christi Jackson said the new ban suggested ""lessons have been learned"" from Trump's first attempt. The latest ban was not being implemented immediately, the restrictions were ""wider in scope"" and it had ""clearly defined"" exemptions, she told the BBC. Professor of law and former US attorney Barbara McQuade said the last travel ban had ""caused chaos at the border"", while this time Trump had given some advance notice. ""The first time around it included lawful permanent residents or Green Card holders, people who had established status in the United States, which courts found to be a violation of the Constitution,"" she told BBC Newshour. ""This time I think there has been more thought given to this,"" she said, adding it was ""very likely"" to be upheld by the Supreme Court.

2025-06-05,Article,Women warned weight-loss jabs may affect the pill,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/cn0gp2pl7zwo,"Women using weight-loss jabs have been warned by the UK's medicines regulator that they must use effective contraception. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) says it is not known whether taking the medicines, such as Wegovy and Mounjaro, could harm an unborn baby. It also warns that weight-loss jabs may make the contraceptive pill less likely to work in those who are overweight or obese. There are concerns that the growing popularity of 'skinny jabs' means many women aren't using the drugs safely or getting the right advice. It's thought the contraceptive pill may not be absorbed properly due to common side-effects of the jabs such as vomiting and diarrhoea, and because they slow the emptying of the stomach.  The MHRA says women should use contraception while taking GLP-1 medicines and for a certain period afterwards before trying to become pregnant - two months for Wegovy and Ozempic, and one month for Mounjaro. It also advises that those using Mounjaro and taking an oral contraceptive should also use a condom for four weeks after starting the drug, or switch to another method such as the coil or implant.  Advice on contraception already appears in patient information leaflets that come with the medicines, but the MHRA has now issued its own guidance. The drugs safety body says weight-loss injections must not be taken: Women should be told this information when they starting taking the jabs, but there are fears the message is not getting through. Natasha Major, 26, started using Mounjaro to lose weight before planning to try for her third baby in a few years' time, but was shocked six weeks later to find she was pregnant. She was taking the contraceptive pill at the time. ""I have polycystic ovaries as well, so I can't get pregnant easily or quickly. So it was an even bigger shock that I had, which didn't make any sense to me,"" she says. She then worried she could be harming the baby or it would not develop properly. Natasha rang her GP for advice and was told to stop taking it. ""We're over the initial shock now and really happy, just wasn't expected,"" she says.  ""The last injection I took, I found out about the pregnancy three hours later and haven't taken it since then. ""I've had an early scan to make sure the pregnancy was viable and okay - baby had a little heartbeat and everything looks good,"" Natasha says.  The MHRA, as well as doctors and pharmacists, are worried that popular GLP-1 medicines, known as Wegovy, Mounjaro, Saxenda, Victoza and Ozempic, are not being used safely. These prescription medicines, which are licensed to treat obesity (and Ozempic for type 2 diabetes), make people feel full by mimicking a hormone released after eating. Mounjaro also acts on another hormone linked to appetite and blood sugar control. They are only available on the NHS to people with a very high BMI, but can also be bought privately from high street and online chemists. Such is the demand for the jabs, they are also being sold illegally on social media and from beauty salons, without any medical advice or prescription, as a quick fix to lose weight.  The MHRA advises people to have a conversation with their prescriber about the risks and benefits of taking them, and understand the potential side-effects by talking to a doctor or pharmacist. It has acted now because it has received around 40 reports relating to pregnancy made to its Yellow Card scheme, where the public can report suspected side-effects of medicines. Some of these have been unintended pregnancies. Dr Alison Cave, chief safety officer at the MHRA, said there was evidence from animal studies ""that these medicines may harm the unborn baby"". ""But we don't know whether we have the same effects in humans, so much more data is needed to determine that."" Women of child-bearing age are usually not included in clinical trials, which is why there is a lack of safety information for them. ""If you are taking this medicine and you are pregnant, you should talk to your doctor about stopping the medicine as soon as possible,"" Dr Cave said. Sukhi Basra, vice-chairwoman of the National Pharmacy Association, said women should visit their pharmacist for advice if they are confused about when to stop using the drugs, and always buy them from an official pharmacy. Dr Bassel Wattar, pregnancy expert and consultant at Epsom and St Helier University Hospitals, said the implant or the intrauterine coil offered ""more robust contraception"" than the oral combined contraceptive pill while taking the injections. Losing a lot of weight can sometimes help some women restore natural ovulation and boost their chances of becoming pregnant, but he said this should be planned under the care of specialist doctors ""to ensure a pregnancy can be planned safely after a washout period off these drugs"". BPAS, the British Pregnancy Advisory Service, says women in the UK ""face significant challenges"" when trying to access their contraceptive method of choice. A lack of appointments, long waiting lists and high costs are just some of the barriers they face, BPAS said, as it called for a better plan for providing the choice women need.

2025-06-05,Article,How airline fees have turned baggage into billions,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/c0qg3ylx2g9o,"With Air Canada and Southwest the latest airlines to charge passengers for check-in luggage, the ballooning cost of such ancillary or ""junk fees"" is provoking anger among politicians and consumer groups. At the same time, sales of suitcases small enough for passengers to take on the plane as hand luggage are booming. Standing outside Toronto's downtown airport, Lauren Alexander has flown over from Boston for the weekend. She describes such additional charges as ""ridiculous"". ""It feels like a trick,"" says the 24-year-old. ""You buy the ticket, you think it's going to be less expensive, then you have to pay $200 (£148) extra [to bring a suitcase]."" To avoid the fee, Ms Alexander instead travelled with a small backpack as hand luggage. Sage Riley, who is 27, agrees, telling the BBC, ""It can be pricey."" There was a time when checked bags, seat selection and your meals all came as standard on commercial flights. But that all changed with the rise of the budget airlines, says Jay Sorensen of US aviation consultancy IdeaWorks. It was in 2006 when UK low-cost carrier FlyBe became what is believed to be the world's first airline to start charging passengers to check in bags. It charged £2 for a pre-booked item of luggage, and £4 if the customer hadn't paid in advance.  Other budget carriers then quickly followed suit, with the so-called flag carriers or established airlines then also doing so, at least on shorter flights. In 2008 American Airlines became the first US airline to charge a fee, $15, for the first checked bag on its domestic routes. Mr Sorenson says such traditional airlines felt they had no choice when they ""began to realise that the low-cost carriers were providing very significant competition"". He adds: ""They felt they had to do something to meet that."" Fast forward to today, and US airlines alone made $7.27bn from check-in baggage fees last year, according to federal figures. That is up from $7bn in 2023, and $5.76bn in 2019. Little wonder then that more of us are trying to just take carry-on. Kirsty Glenn, managing director of UK luggage firm Antler, confirms that there is an ongoing surge in demand for small suitcases that meet airline dimension limits for carry-on luggage. ""We have seen huge spikes in searches online and on our website,"" she says. Describing a new small-dimension case her company launched in April, Ms Glenn adds: ""Testament to the trend of only travelling with hand luggage, it's sold like crazy."" At the same time, social media content about travel packing ""hacks"" and luggage that meets airlines' carry-on size measurements, have soared according to travel journalist Chelsea Dickenson. She makes this content for TikTok. ""Social media has really propelled this idea of needing a bag that fits the baggage allowance requirements, says Ms Dickenson. ""It's become a core part of the content that I create and post on social media."" Ms Dickenson, whose social media following has ballooned to close to a million followers, adds that her luggage videos have become a ""core part of the content"" she creates. ""It blows my mind,"" she says. ""I could spend weeks and weeks researching a big trip, and the resulting videos will not come close to doing as well as me going and buying a cheap suitcase, taking it to the airport, testing it in one of those baggage sizes and reporting back."" The overall global cost of all airline extra fees, from luggage to seat selection, buying wifi access, lounge access, upgrades, and food and drink, is expected to reach $145bn this year, 14% of the sector's total revenues. That's according to the International Air Transport Association, which represents the industry. This compares with $137bn last year. These numbers have caught the attention of some politicians in Washington, and last December airline bosses were grilled before a senate committee. It was a Democrat senator who used the term ""junk fees"".   He wants the federal government to review such costs and potentially fine airlines. We asked the US Department of Transportation for a comment, but did not get a response. But if having to pay for check-in wasn't enough, a growing number of airlines are now charging for hand luggage. For example, Irish budget airline Ryanair will only allow you to carry a small bag that fits under the seat in front of you for free. If you want to take a bigger bag or suitcase to go in the overhead locker that will cost you from £6. Other European airlines that now have similar charges for hand luggage are Easyjet, Norwegian Airlines, Transavia, Volotea, Vueling, and Wizzair. This has annoyed pan-European consumer group Becu (The European Consumer Organisation), which last month filed a complaint with the European Commission. Becu cites a 2014 EU Court of Justice ruling, which said ""carriage of hand baggage cannot be made subject to a price supplement, provided that it meets reasonable requirements in terms of its weight and dimensions, and complies with applicable security requirements"". However, what determines ""reasonable requirements"" continues to be a grey area in need of an official ruling. There can, however, be a different way of doing things, as shown by Indian airline IndiGo. Its boss Pieter Eibers says that it does not charge for check-in luggage. ""The entire philosophy here is different,"" he says. ""We don't want long lines, and endless debates at gates about the weight of luggage. We don't have any of that. We turn our planes around in 35 minutes."" Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.  The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites. Read about our approach to external linking.  "
2025-06-05,Article,'I slowly realised I was running two households',https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/c5y4zzwr943o,"As retirement age rises for many people, more grown-up children than ever are providing their parents with the support they need to go on living independently, while also continuing to work full time themselves. Christine Bell is one of these so-called ""carents"". Christine is preparing to take her 95-year-old father Colin to a routine hospital appointment. But, for Christine, who lives in Guiseley, Leeds, that means a 400-mile round trip and two days away from running her own business as her father lives in London. It is a train journey she has made many times in the last 15 years.  Her late mum, Beryl, once broke her knee in a fall and, in order for her to stay at home, Christine and her sister decided to divide up her care between them. ""Slowly, I realised I was running two households,"" Christine says. ""I was doing all their bills; I had more contact with their GP than mine."" As Beryl's health deteriorated and Christine tried to manage her mother's palliative care long-distance alongside managing her own life, she says she eventually reached breaking point. Becoming emotional, Christine explains: ""There were times I just wanted my mum to die because she was suffering."" Having packed for her latest trip to the South, Christine takes one train into Leeds city centre and then another one to London, before finally getting the tube to her father's house.  By the time she returns to Leeds, she will have been travelling for more than nine hours, all so she can accompany her father to a 10-minute appointment at a nearby pacemaker clinic. Christine says she has been lucky to have a ""really loving"" relationship with her parents, but at times she has found it overwhelming trying to support them to stay at home alongside continuing her own work. According to Dr Jackie Gray, Christine is far from alone. Dr Gray, a retired GP and public health consultant based in Northumberland, says she has watched the role adult children play in ageing parents' lives change ""dramatically"" over the course of her career.  She explains that when she first qualified, it was rare to see people living past 75. ""But, medical advancements, people living and working longer, as well as living further away from their parents, has caused a kind of perfect storm - a societal shift,"" she says. In 2020, after seeing increasing numbers of patients - usually women, she says - struggle with caring for their parents, Dr Gray launched the Carents Room website, offering forums and information. Dr Gray says ""nobody really knows"" how many ""carents"" there are, but a 2023 King's Fund report suggested that about 57% of unpaid carers were looking after a parent or grandparent. That means there could be up to four million people in this position in England alone, she says. A recent Carents Room survey of at least 1,000 members found more than half provided about 20 hours of care a week.  Meanwhile, 70% said they had reduced their working hours or left work altogether so they could care for their relatives. According to Dr Gray, family relationships can be complex and older people can find the idea of their children as carers upsetting - as can the grown-up children themselves. Relationships with siblings can also be fraught, she says. Plus, Dr Gray points out that ""carents"" can often struggle with what she calls a sense of ""anticipatory grief"". All of this means the support group she set up has seen a rise in people seeking help. ""We have a signed-up community of about 40,000 people, and that is growing by almost 100 people a day,"" she says. Common themes, including struggling with ""life admin"", appointments, travel, and balancing work commitments all emerge from the online forums and focus groups, Dr Gray explains. According to the Office of National Statistics (ONS), there were an estimated 1.4 million so-called ""sandwich"" carers - people who provide care for sick, disabled, or older adult relatives as well as for dependent children - in the UK between 2021 and 2023. The ONS found that 61% of ""sandwich"" carers were female. It also found that in England, the North East had the highest proportion of unpaid carers, at 10.1%, compared to other regions, as well as the highest proportion of people providing 50 or more hours of care. Meanwhile, according to figures compiled by Carers UK, in England and Wales, unpaid carers provided care worth £183bn in 2021-22 - an increase of £64.9bn since 2011. Dr Gray says that each family affected in this way has its own set of circumstances and, crucially, each family member has their own feelings about the situation. But, as the population lives longer and with more health needs, and with women also now expected to work for longer, the state's reliance on families to protect an already creaking social care system increases. Dr Gray says recognition and support are key. ""It can be hard for an adult child to accept they are a carer,"" she says. ""But once you've got that recognition in place and people feel heard, I think we're looking at really practical solutions,"" she says. Dr Gray explains that ""coordinating healthcare"" and ""opportunities for respite care"" could help people like Christine who care for elderly relatives.   She adds that she believes ""some sort of commissioner, a commissioner for frailty, perhaps"" should be introduced by the government.  Those taking part in Dr Gray's focus groups say more flexibility in appointment systems, as well as ""carental"" leave and tax breaks, might also help. A spokesperson for the government said it recognised ""the immense contribution of carers who selflessly dedicate their time to supporting others, and want families to receive the support they deserve.  ""We have increased the Carer's Allowance earnings threshold by around an additional £2,000 a year – the biggest rise since it was introduced in 1976. ""We have also launched an independent review into social care, which will include exploring the needs of unpaid carers who provide vital care and support."" Back in Leeds after her 400-mile round trip taking her father to his appointment, Christine Bell says at times she found it hard to think of herself as carer to her parents. ""I am, because without me, their house wouldn't have run, they wouldn't have had the care that they need,"" she says. ""But I want to be a daughter, first and foremost.""

2025-06-05,Article,Supreme Court rejects Mexico lawsuit against US gunmakers ,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/c1dez6rwz07o,"The US Supreme Court has blocked a lawsuit brought by Mexico that sought to hold American gunmakers accountable for playing a role in country's struggle with drug cartels. The court voted 9-0 to reject the suit, in the process upholding a 2005 law that shields gun manufacturers from liability if weapons they produce are misused. Mexico's government had argued that the ""flood"" of illegal guns across the border is a result of ""deliberate"" practices by US firms that they say appealed to cartel members with their products.  The decision overturns a lower court's ruling that allowed the suit, brought against manufacturer Smith & Wesson and wholesaler Interstate Arms, to proceed. Mexico's original lawsuit was filed in 2021 against eight gun manufacturers, but the cases against six of them were dismissed by a district court.  The Supreme Court has now rejected the suit in its entirety, agreeing the case satisfied an exception to the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA), which limits the liability of gun manufactures.  In its complaint, the Mexican government argued that the gun manufacturers ""supply firearms to retail dealers whom they know illegally sell to Mexican gun traffickers"". It also claimed that the manufacturers did not impose any controls on their distribution networks to prevent the sale of these weapons to traffickers in Mexico.  The Supreme Court said Mexico's complaint ""does not plausibly allege that the defendant manufacturers aided and abetted gun dealers' unlawful sales of firearms to Mexican traffickers"". The court said it has ""little doubt"" some guns are sold to Mexican firearm traffickers. However, it added that the government had been unable to prove that the manufacturers ""participate in"" those sales, as its complaint did not identify any specific criminal transactions.  Mexico's accusation was more general, the court said - that the manufacturers help a number of unidentified ""rogue gun dealers"" sell firearms illegally. This case is the first time the court has taken up the PLCAA shield law, which limits the ability of victims of gun violence to sue firearms manufacturers and dealers for the misuse of their products.  At a hearing in March, the court appeared sceptical of Mexico's challenge, with justices on both sides of the ideological spectrum questioning the validity of the suit.  An investigation by the BBC's US partner CBS News revealed that between 200,000 and 500,000 US-made firearms are trafficked to Mexico each year.  Almost half the guns recovered at crime scenes in Mexico are manufactured in the US, CBS reported citing data from the US' Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Copyright 2025 BBC.

2025-06-05,Article,First bacteria we ever meet can keep us out of hospital,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/cgr5lej9l8lo,"The first bacteria our bodies meet – in the hours after we're born – could protect us from dangerous infections, UK scientists say. They have shown, for the first time, that good bacteria seem to halve the risk of young children being admitted to hospital with lung infections. The researchers said it was a ""phenomenal"" finding and could lead to therapies that boost good bacteria in babies. Our early encounters with microbes are thought to be crucial in how our immune system develops. We come out of the womb sterile, but this doesn't last for long. All the nooks and crannies of the human body become home to a world of microbial life, known as the microbiome. Researchers at University College London and the Sanger Institute investigated the earliest stages in our body's colonisation by bacteria, fungi and more. They collected stool samples from 1,082 newborns in the first week of life. The team then performed a massive genetic analysis on all the DNA in the samples to work out exactly which species were present and how common they were in each child. They then tracked what happened to those babies, using hospital data, for the next two years. One particular early inhabitant of the human body, Bifidobacterium longum, seemed to have a protective effect. Only 4% of babies with this species would spend a night in hospital with a lung infection over the next two years. Babies with different starter-bacteria were two-to-three times more likely to need to stay in hospital. It is the first data to show the formation of the microbiome affects the risk of infection. ""I think it's really phenomenal. It's amazing to be able to show this. I'm excited,"" Prof Nigel Field, from UCL, told the BBC.  The most likely culprit for children ending up in hospital is respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), but what joins the dots between this and B. longum? That is the ""million dollar question"" for Prof Field. We know B. longum starts off digesting breast milk which both contains food for the baby and encourages good bacteria.  The exact details have not yet been worked out, but either the bacteria themselves or the compounds they make by digesting food are interacting with the immune system ""and are influencing the way in which the immune system matures and is able to recognise friend from foe,"" according to Prof Field. The protective bacteria were found only in babies that came into the world via a vaginal delivery rather than a caesarean. Even then they were not discovered after every vaginal delivery. The researchers say their findings do not justify the practice of vaginal seeding,  where some new parents smear babies with a swab taken from the vagina. The good bacteria seem to be coming from the end of the mother's digestive system, an idea known in the field as the ""first lick"". ""I feel pretty confident in saying that vaginal seeding is not a good thing,"" said Prof Field. However, the long-term ambition is to come up with microbial therapies – like a probiotic yogurt – that could be given to babies to set their microbiomes on a healthy path. Prof Louise Kenny, from the University of Liverpool and a consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist, said: ""A caesarean section is often a life-saving procedure, and can be the right choice for a woman and her baby."" She said that while the benefit was seen only in babies born vaginally, it was not in every child born that way so ""further research is needed to create a full, nuanced picture"".

The Supreme Court said Mexico's complaint ""does not plausibly allege that the defendant manufacturers aided and abetted gun dealers' unlawful sales of firearms to Mexican traffickers"". The court said it has ""little doubt"" some guns are sold to Mexican firearm traffickers. However, it added that the government had been unable to prove that the manufacturers ""participate in"" those sales, as its complaint did not identify any specific criminal transactions.  Mexico's accusation was more general, the court said - that the manufacturers help a number of unidentified ""rogue gun dealers"" sell firearms illegally. This case is the first time the court has taken up the PLCAA shield law, which limits the ability of victims of gun violence to sue firearms manufacturers and dealers for the misuse of their products.  At a hearing in March, the court appeared sceptical of Mexico's challenge, with justices on both sides of the ideological spectrum questioning the validity of the suit.  An investigation by the BBC's US partner CBS News revealed that between 200,000 and 500,000 US-made firearms are trafficked to Mexico each year.  Almost half the guns recovered at crime scenes in Mexico are manufactured in the US, CBS reported citing data from the US' Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Copyright 2025 BBC.

2025-06-05,Article,Stores open at midnight as fans rush to buy Nintendo Switch 2,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/ckgxwe774zwo,"The Nintendo Switch 2 has been released worldwide, with stores opening at midnight so fans could get their hands on the long-awaited console the moment it became available. Some shops have the devices available to buy off the shelf - but in most cases customers have been picking up consoles they had ordered in advance, with UK retailer Currys calling it its ""biggest gaming pre-order ever."" Despite the excitement there have been some setbacks, with one supplier, Game, cancelling some pre-orders.  In the US, Nintendo briefly pulled Switch 2 pre-orders in April over concerns around tariffs before starting again a few weeks later. But that doesn't appear to have put fans off- with queues forming at stores around the world as gamers vied to be among the first to unbox their new console. Currys told the BBC it had sold 30,000 units - which it attributed to the ""incredible excitement"" associated with the launch. Despite the initial excitement, questions remain over whether the Switch 2 will match the success of its predecessor - the third-best selling console in history - in part because of its high game prices. A physical copy of its most high-profile game, Mario Kart World, comes in at £74.99 - £15 more expensive than a typical Switch title. The original Nintendo Switch has shifted more than 150 million units since its 2017 release. A successor has been in the works for years - so perhaps unsurprisingly Tushar Sandarka, the President of the University of York's Mario Kart society, is among those excited about the launch, and the new version of Mario coming with it. ""It's coming out with Mario Kart World - which is the first since 2014 - it's a big deal for us,"" the 19-year-old said. ""Securing a pre-order was such a tough decision because it's so expensive.  ""Even if it's a bit higher than I would have wanted to pay for it, it's going to serve me well for the next 7 or 8 years."" But not everyone the BBC spoke to said they would be picking up the console on launch. Mae and Lottie, both students in York, said they would stick to the original Switch because of the cost. ""It's quite spenny,"" Mae said. ""What we've got is fine."" Lottie agreed, but said she was disappointed not to play on the new Mario Kart game - which she said could cost her as much as ""a day's pay"".  ""I'm not spending that on a game,"" she said. For Nintendo, the Switch 2 represents a change in strategy - in the past its new devices have been given an entirely new name. ""This is the first time Nintendo has ever launched a straight sequel,"" GamesRadar+ brand director Sam Loveridge told the BBC.  ""It's a clear proposition for consumers - they know exactly what they're getting from this console if they are familiar with the original Switch."" She said ""everything is pointing to"" pre-orders having sold well.  ""When pre-orders first went live, it was an absolute scramble to find any stock, but Nintendo was clearly prepared and since those early weeks, it's been a lot easier to secure yourself a console for launch day,"" she said. I was one of the lucky few to get my hands on the Switch 2 at an event in April. Like its predecessor, it is a ""hybrid"" console - a handheld device which can also be plugged into a TV to play on the big screen. But it has a bigger and brighter screen, along with lots more power and storage. It still has a bit of innovation - you can use the controller like a computer mouse by twisting it on its side, making PC games such as Civilization VII a more enjoyable experience than using joysticks. But many of the showcase Nintendo games on display at that event  - including Metroid Prime 4, Donkey Kong: Bananza, and Super Mario Party Jamboree TV - won't be available at launch. Instead the only new Nintendo game on the new console will be Mario Kart World, barring a small title called Welcome Tour which showcases some of the new hardware. ""It might seem like an odd bet, but with the original Mario Kart 8 being the best-selling Wii U game and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe being the best-selling Nintendo Switch game, there's a very established audience there,"" Ms Loveridge said. The gaming giant is also releasing on day one upgraded versions of the Switch's Legend of Zelda games, Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom, which take advantage of the console's greater power. Beyond that, gamers will have to look to third-party games for alternatives on launch. The range of games includes Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma, Cyberpunk 2077, and Bravely Default. ""This more powerful console offers plenty of opportunities for third-party games publishers bringing Nintendo into more direct competition with Sony and Microsoft,"" said Katie Holt, senior games industry research analyst at Ampere Analysis . And fans can expect more from third-party games as the console develops too - with Nintendo senior director Takuhiro Dohta telling me he expected games to get even better. ""When there are software titles set for the launch of the hardware, the developers still don't fully know the capabilities and hardware well enough,"" he said.  ""As developers continue to develop, they start to understand how it works and what it's capable of, so I think we can expect improvements not only in graphics but in gameplay too.""

2025-06-05,Article,Rare oil portrait of Mahatma Gandhi to be auctioned in London,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/cp3nl6gq7vlo,"A rare oil portrait of Indian independence leader Mahatma Gandhi - painted in 1931 in the UK - will be auctioned in London next month. Gandhi led a non-violent resistance movement against British rule in India and his teachings have inspired millions. Most Indians revere him as the ""father of the nation"". Over the years, several paintings, drawings and sketches of him have circulated around the world.  The auction house Bonhams says the painting, made by British artist Clare Leighton, is ""thought to be the only oil portrait that Gandhi actually sat for"". The portrait was made when Gandhi went to London in 1931 for the second Round Table conference, held to discuss constitutional reforms for India and address its demands for self-governance.  It will be auctioned in the second week of July at Bonhams.  ""This is a painting of unique historic and cultural significance. It would be great if it could be seen and appreciated more widely, whether in India or elsewhere,"" Caspar Leighton, a great nephew of the artist, told the BBC. According to Bonhams, Clare Leighton ""was one of the very few artists admitted to his office and was given the opportunity to sit with on multiple occasions to sketch and paint his likeness"". The works remained in the artist's collection until her death in 1989 in the US, after which it was passed down through her family. She was introduced to Gandhi through her partner and British political journalist, Henry Noel Brailsford, who was a strong supporter of India's independence movement. In November 1931, Leighton showcased her portraits of Gandhi at an exhibition at the Albany Galleries in London.  Though Gandhi did not attend the opening event, several representatives from the Indian delegation of the second Round Table were present.  Among them was Sarojini Naidu, also an eminent Indian independence leader, who was one of the key advisors to Gandhi at the meeting.  The exhibition included a charcoal sketch of Gandhi, asleep in his office, along with the oil portrait that is now set to be auctioned.  About the painting of Gandhi, British Journalist Winifred Holtby wrote: ""The little man squats bare-headed, in his blanket, one finger raised, as it often is to emphasise a point, his mouth parted for a word that is almost a smile"". The following month, Gandhi's personal secretary Mahadev Desai wrote to Leighton, saying, ""many of my friends who saw it [the oil portrait] in the Albany Gallery said to me that it was a good likeness"". There doesn't seem to be any public record of the oil portrait being displayed elsewhere until 1978, when the Boston Public Library organised an exhibition of Leighton's works. However, according to the artist's family, the portrait was thought to have been on display in the 1970s in the US, where it was allegedly damaged in a knife attack.  A label attached to the backing board of the portrait says it was restored by the Lyman Allyn Museum Conservation Laboratory in Connecticut in 1974. The details of the alleged attack are not clear - according to Bonhams, it was carried out by a right-wing Hindu activist.  Hindu hardliners in India accuse Gandhi of having betrayed Hindus by being too pro-Muslim, and blame him for the division of India and the bloodshed that marked Partition, which saw India and Pakistan created after independence in 1947. He was shot dead on 30 January 1948 at a prayer meeting by Nathuram Godse, an activist with nationalist right-wing groups. Copyright 2025 BBC.

2025-06-05,Article,First bacteria we ever meet can keep us out of hospital,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/cgr5lej9l8lo,"The first bacteria our bodies meet – in the hours after we're born – could protect us from dangerous infections, UK scientists say. They have shown, for the first time, that good bacteria seem to halve the risk of young children being admitted to hospital with lung infections. The researchers said it was a ""phenomenal"" finding and could lead to therapies that boost good bacteria in babies. Our early encounters with microbes are thought to be crucial in how our immune system develops. We come out of the womb sterile, but this doesn't last for long. All the nooks and crannies of the human body become home to a world of microbial life, known as the microbiome. Researchers at University College London and the Sanger Institute investigated the earliest stages in our body's colonisation by bacteria, fungi and more. They collected stool samples from 1,082 newborns in the first week of life. The team then performed a massive genetic analysis on all the DNA in the samples to work out exactly which species were present and how common they were in each child. They then tracked what happened to those babies, using hospital data, for the next two years. One particular early inhabitant of the human body, Bifidobacterium longum, seemed to have a protective effect. Only 4% of babies with this species would spend a night in hospital with a lung infection over the next two years. Babies with different starter-bacteria were two-to-three times more likely to need to stay in hospital. It is the first data to show the formation of the microbiome affects the risk of infection. ""I think it's really phenomenal. It's amazing to be able to show this. I'm excited,"" Prof Nigel Field, from UCL, told the BBC.  The most likely culprit for children ending up in hospital is respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), but what joins the dots between this and B. longum? That is the ""million dollar question"" for Prof Field. We know B. longum starts off digesting breast milk which both contains food for the baby and encourages good bacteria.  The exact details have not yet been worked out, but either the bacteria themselves or the compounds they make by digesting food are interacting with the immune system ""and are influencing the way in which the immune system matures and is able to recognise friend from foe,"" according to Prof Field. The protective bacteria were found only in babies that came into the world via a vaginal delivery rather than a caesarean. Even then they were not discovered after every vaginal delivery. The researchers say their findings do not justify the practice of vaginal seeding,  where some new parents smear babies with a swab taken from the vagina. The good bacteria seem to be coming from the end of the mother's digestive system, an idea known in the field as the ""first lick"". ""I feel pretty confident in saying that vaginal seeding is not a good thing,"" said Prof Field. However, the long-term ambition is to come up with microbial therapies – like a probiotic yogurt – that could be given to babies to set their microbiomes on a healthy path. Prof Louise Kenny, from the University of Liverpool and a consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist, said: ""A caesarean section is often a life-saving procedure, and can be the right choice for a woman and her baby."" She said that while the benefit was seen only in babies born vaginally, it was not in every child born that way so ""further research is needed to create a full, nuanced picture"".
