2025-06-05,Article,News,Trump and Musk enter bitter feud - and Washington buckles up,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/c3wd2215q08o,"What happens when the richest person and the most powerful politician have a knock-down, drag-out fight? The world may be about to find out. A disagreement between Elon Musk and Donald Trump started at a simmer last week, began bubbling on Wednesday and is now in full-on boil. And like everything these two men do, it is all spilling out into public view. These two men have two of the world's biggest megaphones, and they clearly enjoy using them. In remarks at the Oval Office on Thursday afternoon, Trump sounded a bit like a spurned lover. He expressed surprise at Musk's criticism of his ""big, beautiful"" tax and spending legislation. He pushed back against the notion that he would have lost last year's presidential election without Musk's hundreds of millions of dollars in support. And he said Musk was only changing his tune now because his car company, Tesla, will be hurt by the Republican push to end electric vehicle tax credits. Musk took to his social media site, X, with a very Generation X response for his 220 million followers: ""Whatever"". He said he didn't care about the car subsidies, he wanted to shrink the national debt, which he says is an existential threat to the nation. He called Trump ""ungrateful"" for his help last year and insisted that Democrats would have prevailed without him. Musk and Trump had formed a powerful but unlikely alliance , culminating in the tech billionaire having a key position of budget-slashing authority in the Trump administration. Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, or Doge, became one of the biggest stories of Trump's first 100 days, as it shuttered entire agencies and dismissed thousands of government workers. It wasn't long, however, before speculation began over when – and how - the two outsized personalities would ultimately fall out. For a while, it seemed like those predictions were off the mark. Trump stood by Musk even as the latter's popularity dropped, as he feuded with administration officials and as he became a liability in several key elections earlier this year. Every time it appeared there would be a break, Musk would pop up in the Oval Office, or the Cabinet room or on the president's Air Force One flight to Mar-a-Lago. When Musk's 130 days as a ""special government employee"" ended last week, the two had a chummy Oval Office send-off, with hints that Musk might someday return. It's safe to say that any invitation has been rescinded. ""Elon and I had a great relationship,"" Trump said on Thursday – a comment notable for its use of the past tense. There had been some thought that Trump's surprise announcement on Wednesday night of a new travel ban, additional sanctions on Harvard and a conspiracy-laced administration investigation of former President Joe Biden were all efforts to change the subject from Musk's criticism. The White House and its allies in Congress seemed careful not to further antagonise him after his earlier comments. Then Trump spoke out and … so much for that. Now the question is where the dispute goes next. Congressional Republicans could find it harder to keep their members behind Trump's bill with Musk providing rhetorical – and, perhaps financial – air for those who break ranks.  Trump, who takes pride in being a devastating counterpuncher, will have plenty of opportunity to lay into Musk. What will happen to Musk's Doge allies still in the Trump administration or government contracts to Musk-related companies or Biden-era investigations into Musk's business dealings? ""The easiest way to save money in our budget, billions and billions of dollars, is to terminate Elon's governmental subsidies and contracts,"" Trump posted menacingly on his own social media website. If Trump turns the machinery of government against Musk, the tech billionaire will feel pain. Tesla's stock price slipped on Thursday.  But Musk also has near limitless resources to respond, including by funding insurgent challengers to Republicans in next year's elections and primaries. He may not win a fight against the whole of Trump's government, but he could exact a high political price. Meanwhile, Democrats are on the sidelines, wondering how to respond. Few seem willing to welcome Musk, a former donor to their party, back into the fold. But there's also the old adage that the enemy of an enemy is a friend. ""It's a zero-sum game,"" Liam Kerr, a Democratic strategist, told Politico. ""Anything that he does that moves more toward Democrats hurts Republicans."" At the very least, Democrats seem happy to stand back and let the two men exchange blows. And until they abandon this fight, the din is likely to drown out everything else in American politics. But don't expect this spat to end anytime soon. ""Trump has 3.5 years left as president,"" Musk wrote on X, ""but I will be around for 40-plus years."" Copyright 2025 BBC.

2025-06-05,Article,News,"Trump's new ban dodges pitfalls faced by last attempt, experts say",https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/cd7gp8l1241o,"US President Donald Trump has issued a sweeping new travel ban for people from 12 countries, revisiting a hallmark policy of his first term in office. There are some key differences, however. The original travel ban suffered a series of legal defeats. This time, the policy appears to have been designed to avoid the same pitfalls. Its predecessor, which targeted seven predominantly Muslim countries and was dubbed the ""Muslim ban"" by critics, was ordered just a week after Trump took office in 2017, during his first term in the White House. The ban was amended twice to overcome court challenges, after opponents argued it was unconstitutional and illegal because it discriminated against travellers based on their religion. A scaled-back version was eventually upheld by the US Supreme Court in 2018, which this new ban closely resembles. Legal experts told the BBC that it appeared Trump had learned lessons from his first attempt. Christi Jackson, an expert in US immigration law at the London firm Laura Devine Immigration, said the new ban was more legally robust as a result. While the first lacked ""clarity"", the new restrictions were ""wider in scope"" and had ""clearly defined"" exemptions, she said. While there are some similarities in the nations chosen by the 2017 ban and the 2025 ban, Muslim-majority states are not the express target of the latest order. Barbara McQuade, professor of law at the University of Michigan and former US attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan, told the BBC World Service's Newshour programme that, on this basis, it seemed likely to win the approval of the Supreme Court if it was ever referred up to that level. The 12 countries subject to the harshest restrictions from 9 June are mainly in the Middle East, Africa and the Caribbean, including Afghanistan, Iran and Somalia. There will be partial restrictions on travellers from another seven countries, including Cuban and Venezuelan nationals. Trump said the strength of the restrictions would be graded against the severity of the perceived threat, including from terrorism. But besides Iran, none of the 12 countries hit by the outright ban are named on the US government's state sponsors of terrorism list. Trump cited Sunday's incident in Boulder, Colorado, in which a man was accused of throwing Molotov cocktails at demonstrators attending a march for Israeli hostages, in a video announcing the ban on X. The alleged attacker was an Egyptian national. However, Egypt does not appear on either list.  Trump also specified high rates of people overstaying their visas as a reason for listing certain countries. However, Steven D Heller, an immigration lawyer based in the US, said there was a ""lack of clarity"" over what threshold had to be met by a country's overstaying rate in order for that country to be placed on Trump's ban list. That could be the basis for a successful legal challenge, he suggested. ""If they're relying on this notion of excessive overstay rates... they have to define what that actually means,"" he told the BBC. But he noted that existing US law gave the president broad powers over immigration policy. Unlike the first ban, which was to last for only 90 to 120 days, today's order has no end date. It has been met with dismay in the targeted countries.  Venezuela has described the Trump administration as ""supremacists who think they own the world"", though Somalia has pledged to ""engage in dialogue to address the concerns raised"". The original ban spurred mass protests and sowed chaos at US airports.  It was repealed in 2021 by Trump's successor, President Joe Biden, who called the policy ""a stain on our national conscience"". Immigration lawyer Shabnam Lotfi, who challenged the previous travel ban, said it would be an ""uphill battle"" to overturn the new one.  ""The president does have the authority to determine who is admissible to the US,"" she said, adding that because of the way the ban had been written, it was ""harder to find a huge group of people that could file a class-action lawsuit"". ""They've put more thought into it."" Ms Lotfi noted that the new restrictions could have consequences for students and other visa applicants abroad. ""Students who are stuck in administrative processing are impacted. So are winners of the diversity visa lottery who paid fees and went to interviews - they're unlikely to get visas now,"" she said. ""Even EB-5 investors - people who've put over $1 million into the US economy - are affected. And H-1B visa holders stuck abroad, waiting to return to their US employers, could also be blocked.""

2025-06-05,Article,News,Israeli military recovers two hostages' bodies in southern Gaza,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/c989rl23zzno,"Israeli forces have recovered the bodies of two Israeli-Americans taken back to Gaza as hostages during the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, the Israeli military says. Judi Weinstein Haggai, 70, who was also a Canadian citizen, and her husband Gadi Haggai, 72, were murdered by gunmen from the Mujahideen Brigades group when they attacked Kibbutz Nir Oz, a statement said. Their bodies were found in the southern Khan Younis area of Gaza overnight and brought back to Israel for forensic identification. There are now 56 hostages still being held by Hamas in Gaza, at least 20 of whom are believed to be alive. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he and his wife sent their condolences to the families of Judi and Gadi Haggai. ""Our hearts grieve over this terrible loss. May their memories be blessed,"" he added. ""I would like to thank, and express appreciation to, the fighters and commanders for this determined and successful operation. We will not rest, nor will we be silent, until we return home all of our hostages - the living and the deceased."" The couple's families recalled how they ""went out for a walk on the morning of that cursed Saturday and never returned"". ""We welcome the closure and their return to a proper burial at home, in Israel,"" they said. Judi, an English teacher, and Gadi Haggai, who used to work in Kibbutz Nir Oz's kitchen, were last seen alive in a video they shared with a group chat at the start of the 7 October attack. They were seen taking cover in a field as incoming rockets fired from Gaza streaked overhead and the sound of gunfire was heard. Judi later told friends and relatives they had been wounded, before ceasing contact. The couple's daughter Iris Weinstein Haggai said after the attack her mother had told her they had been ""shot by terrorists on a motorcycle and that my dad was wounded really bad"". She added: ""Paramedics tried to send her an ambulance. The ambulance got hit by a rocket."" In December 2023, the kibbutz announced that both Judi and Gadi were killed that day and their bodies were being held hostage in Gaza. On Wednesday, an Israeli military official said the couple's bodies were recovered from the Khan Younis area following an operation based on ""precise intelligence"" from the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and the Shin Bet security service. They said they could not disclose further details due to the sensitivity of the operation. However, Israeli Army Radio reported the intelligence was obtained through the Shin Bet's interrogation of a Palestinian fighter captured by Israeli troops in Gaza. ""We will keep doing the utmost for the mission of bringing our hostages back - the living, to reunite with their families, and the deceased to dignified burial. We will deploy all the methods and tools in our disposal for this goal,"" the military official said. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum urged decision-makers to do everything they could to agree a new ceasefire deal with Hamas to secure the return of all the remaining hostages. ""There is no need to wait another 608 agonising days for this,"" it said. ""The mission can be completed as early as tomorrow morning. This is what the majority of the Israeli people want."" US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said he was ""united in prayer"" for the Haggai family. ""Hamas must release all remaining hostages, including Omer Neutra and Itay Chen,"" he added, referring to two other Israeli-Americans who the Israeli military says were killed on 7 October while serving as soldiers and whose bodies were taken back to Gaza. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said: ""The return of their remains is a time to begin to heal and to rest. We mourn with [Judi Haggai's] family. May her memory be a blessing."" Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza in response to the unprecedented cross-border attack almost 20 months ago, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. Another four people, two of them dead, were already being held captive in Gaza before the conflict. So far, 199 hostages have been returned, 148 of them alive, mostly through two temporary ceasefire deals with Hamas. At least 54,677 people have been killed in Gaza during the war, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Israel imposed a total blockade on Gaza on 2 March and resumed its military offensive against Hamas two weeks later, collapsing a two-month truce during which 33 Israeli hostages and five Thai hostages were freed. Israel said it wanted to put pressure on Hamas to release the remaining hostages. On 19 May, the Israeli military launched an expanded offensive that Netanyahu said would see troops ""take control of all areas"" of Gaza. Israel also partially eased its blockade, allowing some food into the territory amid warnings from experts of a looming famine. More than 4,400 people have reportedly been killed in Gaza over the past three months, while 640,000 others have been displaced again by Israeli ground operations and evacuation orders. Hopes of a new ceasefire deal faded last week, with Hamas and Israel remaining at odds over the conditions of the latest US proposal. Hamas said it was prepared to release 10 living hostages and the bodies of 18 dead ones, which was the number specified in US envoy Steve Witkoff's proposal, in exchange for a 60-day truce and the release of Palestinian prisoners. But the group also repeated its demands for guarantees that the truce would lead to a permanent ceasefire, as well as a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, and the resumption of unrestricted aid deliveries. Israel called Hamas's statement a refusal of the proposal, and Witkoff said it was totally unacceptable. But a Hamas official insisted it had acted positively and responsibly. Copyright 2025 BBC.

2025-06-05,Article,News,"Deadly mushroom cook weighed fatal dose on kitchen scales, says prosecutor",https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/c93yxgyln5po,"An Australian woman accused of murdering relatives with beef Wellington documented herself using kitchen scales to calculate a lethal dose of toxic mushrooms, prosecutors allege. Erin Patterson has pleaded not guilty to killing three people and attempting to murder another at her home in regional Victoria in July 2023. The 50-year-old says she never intended to hurt them and it was a tragic accident. Prosecutors on Thursday suggested photos found on her phone showing wild fungi being weighed depict her measuring the amount required to kill her guests. Ms Patterson told the court she had likely taken the photos in question but said she didn't believe the mushrooms in them were death caps. Ms Patterson's in-laws, Don and Gail Patterson, both 70, along with Gail's sister Heather Wilkinson, 66, all fell ill and died days after the lunch.  Heather's husband, local pastor Ian Wilkinson, was also hospitalised but recovered after coming out of a weeks-long induced coma. The high-profile trial, which started almost six weeks ago, has already heard from more than 50 prosecution witnesses. Ms Patterson became the first defence witness to take the stand on Monday afternoon. Under cross-examination from the lead prosecutor, Ms Patterson admitted she had foraged for wild mushrooms in the three months before the July lunch, despite telling police and a health official that she hadn't.  The court was also shown images, taken in late April 2023 and recovered from Ms Patterson's phone, which depicted mushrooms being weighed. Ms Patterson previously admitted she had repeatedly deleted electronic data in the days following the lunch because she feared that if officers found such pictures they would blame her for the guests' deaths. Pointing to earlier evidence from a fungi expert who said the mushrooms in the images were ""highly consistent"" with death caps, Dr Rogers alleged Ms Patterson had knowingly foraged them days before. She had seen a post on iNaturalist - a website for logging plant and animal sightings - and travelled to the Loch area ten days later on 28 April to pick the toxic fungi, Dr Rogers alleged. Ms Patterson said she couldn't recall if she went to the town that day, but denied she went there to find death cap mushrooms or that she had seen the iNaturalist post. ""I suggest that you were weighing these mushrooms so that you could calculate the weight required for... a fatal dose,"" Dr Rogers put to her. ""Disagree,"" Ms Patterson replied. The mother-of-two also spoke about putting powdered dried mushrooms into a range of foods like spaghetti, brownies and stew, which prosecutors allege was practice for the fatal lunch.  Ms Patterson said this was not true, but rather an attempt to get ""extra vegetables into my kids' bodies"". Prosecutors repeatedly asked her, with different wording each time, whether she had knowingly used the same food dehydrator to prepare death cap mushrooms for the lunch. CCTV played at the trial shows Ms Patterson disposing of the appliance at a local dump. ""That's why you rushed out, the day after your release from [hospital], to get rid of the evidence,"" Dr Rogers said. ""No,"" replied Ms Patterson. Earlier, Ms Patterson's barrister asked her why she repeatedly lied to police about foraging mushrooms and having a food dehydrator. ""It was this stupid knee-jerk reaction to dig deeper and keep lying,"" she told the court. ""I was just scared, but I shouldn't have done it."" Ms Patterson also repeated her claim that she never intentionally put the poisonous fungi in the meal. She said the mushrooms used in the beef Wellington may have accidentally included dried, foraged varieties that were kept in a container with store-bought ones. Ms Patterson was also quizzed on evidence given by other witnesses that she had asked her guests to come to the lunch to discuss health issues, namely a cancer diagnosis.  She said she didn't outright say she had cancer, but still shouldn't have misled her relatives, saying she'd done so partly because their concern made her feel loved. ""I suggest that you never thought you would have to account for this lie about having cancer because you thought the lunch guests would die,"" Dr Rogers said. ""Your lie would never be found out."" ""That's not true,"" Ms Patterson said. She will resume being cross examined on Friday. The trial, initially expected to take six weeks, is now expected to run for at least another fortnight, the judge has told the court. Copyright 2025 BBC.

2025-06-05,Article,Sport,Sabalenka takes out Swiatek to reach French Open final,https://www.bbc.com//sport/tennis/articles/c93yxvwp1lvo,"Aryna Sabalenka has reached five of the past seven Grand Slam finals French Open 2025 Dates: 25 May-8 June Venue: Roland Garros Coverage: Live radio commentaries across 5 Live Sport and BBC Sounds, plus live text commentaries on the BBC Sport website and app World number one Aryna Sabalenka moved a step closer to a maiden French Open title by taking out four-time champion Iga Swiatek in a blockbuster semi-final. Sabalenka will meet second seed Coco Gauff in Saturday's showpiece after the American ruthlessly ended French wildcard Lois Boisson's incredible run. Belarus' Sabalenka earned a 7-6 (7-1) 4-6 6-0 victory to end fifth seed Swiatek's 26-match winning run at the tournament. After a slow start on the Roland Garros clay, Poland's Swiatek fought back to level but Sabalenka dominated a 22-minute deciding set. Sabalenka, whose three Grand Slam titles have all come on hard courts, has never reached the Paris final before. ""It feels incredible but the job is not done yet. I'm thrilled with my performance,"" the 27-year-old said. ""Iga is the toughest opponent, especially at Roland Garros, I'm proud I managed to get this win."" Gauff, runner-up to Swiatek in 2022, won 6-1 6-2 against world number 361 Boisson, who was appearing in her first Grand Slam main draw. This was the potential match that everyone had their eye on when the French Open draw was made: the 'Queen of Clay' against the world number one in the crunch stages. Swiatek and Sabalenka have claimed six of the past 10 majors between them and dominated the WTA Tour over the past three years. But with Swiatek dropping to fifth in the world after a turbulent season, it was Sabalenka who came into Roland Garros as the favourite. The magnitude of the eagerly-anticipated encounter appeared to affect both players in an edgy opening set. With the roof closed because of the wet weather in Paris, Sabalenka initially settled quicker in the heavier conditions that suit her game. The pace of Sabalenka's returning was too hot for Swiatek and allowed the top seed to quickly move a double break ahead. Swiatek took a step back in her baseline position to better absorb the pace and, after being a point away from going 5-1 behind, battled back. Iga Swiatek saw her serve broken eight times during the match The tweak helped a sharper Swiatek elongate the rallies and put more pressure on Sabalenka's serve, with the Pole winning the next three games to move 5-4 ahead. With both players looking tight, momentum continued to fluctuate. Swiatek's serve buckled, Sabalenka could not serve out the set at 6-5 and a nervy encounter was ultimately decided on a tie-break dominated by the Belarusian. Three successive breaks - down to quality returning as much as poor serving - began the second set before Swiatek settled down to maintain the advantage and force a decider. However, Swiatek's serve suddenly dropped off again and allowed Sabalenka to quickly reach her fifth final in the past seven Grand Slam tournaments. ""I think I lost my intensity a bit,"" said Swiatek. ""She played as strong as in the first set, but I didn't react to that well and just couldn't push back."" For the first time since 2011, fans had a home player to cheer in the women's semi-finals - and nobody could have guessed it would be Boisson. The 22-year-old's journey from an unknown player returning from serious injury to a Grand Slam semi-finalist competing with the world's best is extraordinary. Boisson was set to be a wildcard entry last year but had to pull out after tearing an anterior cruciate ligament just a week before the French Open began. But 12 months on, she returned to make a remarkable run that will never be forgotten by French fans. Taking the scalps of third seed Jessica Pegula and sixth seed Mirra Andreeva put her into a first career semi-final on the biggest stage of all. However, Gauff proved to be a step too far. Despite having the backing of a raucous crowd on Court Philippe Chatrier, the energy provided was not enough to compensate for Boisson's lack of quality. Gauff dominated the rallies, breaking Boisson's serve six times before wrapping up victory in one hour and nine minutes. Copyright Â© 2025 BBC.

2025-06-05,Article,News,What we know about Trump's latest travel ban,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/cx271g270v7o,"Donald Trump has signed a ban on travel to the US from 12 countries, citing national security risks. There are also seven additional countries whose nationals will face partial travel restrictions. The US president said the list could be revised if ""material improvements"" were made, while other countries could be added as ""threats emerge around the world"".  It is the second time he has ordered a ban on travel from certain countries. He signed a similar order in 2017 during his first term in office. Trump has signed a proclamation banning travel to the US from nationals of 12 countries: Nationals from these countries will not be allowed to enter the US unless they qualify for an exemption.  There are an additional seven countries whose nationals face partial travel restrictions:  Those under the partial restrictions will not be able to travel to the US with certain visas. The ban takes effect on Monday at 00:01 EDT (04:01 GMT), a cushion that avoids the chaos that unfolded at US airports when a similar measure took effect with virtually no notice eight years ago.  No end date has been provided. The order calls for periodic review. The White House said these ""common sense restrictions"" would ""protect Americans from dangerous foreign actors"". In a video posted to his Truth Social website, Trump said the recent alleged terror attack in Boulder, Colorado ""underscored the extreme dangers"" posed by foreign nationals who had not been ""properly vetted"". Twelve people were injured in Colorado on Sunday when a man attacked a group gathering in support of Israeli hostages, throwing two incendiary devices and using a makeshift flamethrower. The man accused of carrying out the attack has been identified as an Egyptian national, but Egypt is not included on the list of banned countries. Trump has close ties with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who has in the past been described by the US president as his ""favourite dictator"". Only two of the 19 countries are on the US government's State Sponsors of Terrorism list - Iran, which has a full ban, and Cuba, which faces partial travel restrictions. But national security is given as a partial reason for the choices. In the proclamation, Trump said many of the countries listed have a ""historic failure to accept back their removable nationals"" from the US, as well as having ""taken advantage"" of the US by exploiting its visa system. He added that nationals from certain countries also ""pose significant risks"" of overstaying their visas. There are a number of people from affected countries who may still be able to enter the US due to a number of exceptions. The order does not apply to:  In addition, the US Secretary of State may grant exemptions to individuals on a ""case-by-case"" basis, if ""the individual would serve a United States national interest"". Trump's latest order, which is expected to face legal challenges, drew a swift response, at home and abroad.  Chad has retaliated by suspending all visas to US citizens, with President Mahamat Idriss Déby Itno saying the country ""has its dignity and pride"". Somalia promised to work with the US to address any security issues, with ambassador to the US, Dahir Hassan Abdi, saying his country ""values its longstanding relationship"" with the US.  Venezuela's Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello warned that ""being in the United States is a great risk for anyone, not just for Venezuelans"". The African Union, which represents all 55 countries on the continent, called on the US to ""engage in constructive dialogue with the countries concerned"".   It appealed to the US to exercise its right to protect its borders and its citizens' security ""in a manner that is balanced, evidence-based, and reflective of the long-standing partnership between the United States and Africa"". The union said it remained concerned about the ""potential negative impact of such measures"". The UN's human rights chief, Volker Turk, said the ban ""raises concerns from the perspective of international law"" ""The broad and sweeping nature of the new travel ban raises concerns from the perspective of international law,"" Volker Turk said in a statement. That included ""the principle of non-discrimination and of the necessity and proportionality of the measures deployed to meet the security concerns stated"", he told news agency AFP. In the US, Democrats were quick to condemn the move. ""This ban, expanded from Trump's Muslim ban in his first term, will only further isolate us on the world stage,"" Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal wrote on social media. Congressman Don Beyer said Trump had ""betrayed"" the ideals of the founders of the US. Human rights organisation Amnesty International USA described it as ""discriminatory, racist, and downright cruel"", while the US-based Human Rights First called it ""yet another anti-immigrant and punitive action taken"" by the president. But others support the ban. Congressman Clay Higgins of Louisiana said travel to the US was ""a privilege, not a right"".  He claimed on BBC Radio's Today programme that Americans had ""had enough of immigrants coming to our country, violating our laws and committing violence among our people"". Greg Swenson, chairman of Republicans Overseas UK, said the list of countries subject to the travel ban proves the White House is using a ""common sense policy"", but expressed suprise that Egypt had not been included. ""I think what the president has decided was that Egypt, despite having one particular incident from an illegal migrant, might have some policies that are in place which are better than other countries,"" he said. Trump's original ban took place in 2017, during his first White House term, and featured some of the same countries as his latest order, including Iran, Libya and Somalia.   Critics called it a ""Muslim ban"" as the seven countries initially listed were Muslim majority, and it was immediately challenged in courts across the US. The White House revised the policy, ultimately adding two non-Muslim majority countries, North Korea and Venezuela. It was upheld by the US Supreme Court in 2018. Joe Biden, who succeeded Trump as US president, repealed the ban in 2021, calling it ""a stain on our national conscience"". US immigration law expert Christi Jackson said the new ban suggested ""lessons have been learned"" from Trump's first attempt. The latest ban was not being implemented immediately, the restrictions were ""wider in scope"" and it had ""clearly defined"" exemptions, she told the BBC. Professor of law and former US attorney Barbara McQuade said the last travel ban had ""caused chaos at the border"", while this time Trump had given some advance notice. ""The first time around it included lawful permanent residents or Green Card holders, people who had established status in the United States, which courts found to be a violation of the Constitution,"" she told BBC Newshour. ""This time I think there has been more thought given to this,"" she said, adding it was ""very likely"" to be upheld by the Supreme Court.

2025-06-05,Article,News,Three journalists among five killed in Israeli strike on Gaza hospital,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/ckgnp154eeko,"Five people have been killed in an Israeli strike on al-Ahli hospital in Gaza City, according to the Anglican Church, which operates it. The Episcopal Diocese of Jerusalem said three journalists, a father escorting his son to surgery, and another person died on Thursday morning when the hospital's compound was hit. It condemned ""in the strongest possible terms"" the attack, which also injured 30 bystanders, including four hospital staff. The Palestinian Journalists' Syndicate accused Israel of a ""full-fledged war crime"". The Israeli military said it ""precisely struck"" a Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) fighter operating from a command centre inside the hospital's yard. It came the same day as more than 130 global news and press freedom organisations - including the BBC - called for international media to be given immediate access to Gaza and for Palestinian journalists to be given full protection. ""For 20 months, the Israeli authorities have refused to grant journalists outside of Gaza independent access to the Palestinian territory - a situation that is without precedent in modern warfare,"" they wrote in a letter co-ordinated by the Committee to Protect Journalists and Reporters Without Borders. ""Local journalists, those best positioned to tell the truth, face displacement and starvation. To date, nearly 200 journalists have been killed by the Israeli military.  ""Many more have been injured and face constant threats to their lives for doing their jobs: bearing witness. This is a direct attack on press freedom and the right to information."" There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military or government. They have previously denied that Israeli forces have targeted journalists. The Palestinian Journalists' Syndicate said the Israeli strike on al-Ahli hospital's compound directly targeted a media tent. Video footage showed medics and other people rushing to help casualties lying on the ground underneath a tree in a yard and carrying at least four of them into a medical tent. ""The Israeli drone suddenly attacked these colleagues,"" Palestinian journalist Mohammed Ahmed told the news agency Reuters at the scene. ""Three of them [were] martyred, in addition to a number of martyrs among passersby."" ""The Israeli occupation forces are increasing their attacks on us as journalists, trying to prevent us from doing our work,"" he alleged. The journalists' syndicate identified the three dead journalists as Ismail Badah, a cameraman for the PIJ-affiliated Palestine Today TV channel, Soliman Hajaj, a Palestine Today editor, and Samir al-Refai of the Shams News network. Another four journalists were injured, two of whom - Palestine Today correspondent Imad Daloul and Ahmed Qalja, a cameraman for Qatar-based Al-Araby TV - were in a critical condition, it said. The Israeli military said in a statement that it ""precisely struck an Islamic Jihad terrorist who was operating in a command-and-control centre"" in the yard of the hospital. It did not name the target or provide any evidence. The military also accused armed groups of using al-Ahli for ""terrorist activity"" and ""cynically and brutally using the civilian population"" inside - an allegation it has denied. In April, staff at al-Ahli hospital said an Israeli strike destroyed its laboratory and damaged its emergency room. They did not report any direct casualties, but said a child died due to disruption of care. The Israeli military said it hit a Hamas ""command-and-control centre"". Hospitals are specially protected under international humanitarian law. They only lose that protection in certain circumstances, including being used as a base from which to launch an attack, as a weapons depot, or to hide healthy fighters. The Hamas-run Civil Defence agency said Israeli strikes killed at least 37 people across Gaza on Thursday. As well as Gaza City, local media reported deaths in Jabalia and Beit Lahia in the north, and in Khan Younis in the south. Also on Thursday, a controversial US and Israeli-backed aid group working in Gaza said it had reopened two of its distribution centres, a day after closing them for ""renovation"". ""Over the past 24 hours, we have been fully focused on strengthening our distribution sites to ensure safe and more efficient delivery of life-saving aid to the people of Gaza,"" the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation's (GHF) interim executive director John Acree said in a statement. On Wednesday, the GHF announced that it was shutting all of its sites - three out of four of which had been operational - to make them ""as safe as possible"" following a string of deadly incidents nearby. Dozens of Palestinians have been killed in recent days while approaching one of the centres in Rafah on a route that runs through an Israeli military zone. Witnesses have said Israeli forces opened fire at crowds seeking aid. The Israeli military has denied that it fired at civilians within the centre, but it has said that troops fired at ""suspects"" who ignored warning shots and approached them. The GHF has denied that anyone was killed or injured at its centres. The group, which uses US private security contractors, aims to bypass the UN as the main supplier of aid to Palestinians. The UN and other aid groups refuse to co-operate with the new system, saying it contravenes the humanitarian principles of neutrality, impartiality, and independence. They also warn that Gaza's 2.1 million population faces catastrophic levels of hunger after an almost three-month total Israeli blockade that was partially eased two weeks ago. The US and Israel say the GHF's system will prevent aid being stolen by Hamas, which the group denies doing. Separately, the Israeli military said it recovered the bodies of two Israeli-Americans taken back to Gaza as hostages during the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023. Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza in response to the attack, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. At least 54,677 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Copyright 2025 BBC.

2025-06-05,Article,Sport,'There is no crisis' before Euro 2025 - Wiegman,https://www.bbc.com//sport/football/articles/cp92pjg020yo,"This video can not be played 'I'm really happy where we are right now' England manager Sarina Wiegman says ""there is no crisis"" despite a chaotic 10 days which has seen three high-profile senior players either retire from international football in the build-up to Euro 2025 or withdraw from the tournament. Wiegman named a 23-player squad on Thursday for the tournament in Switzerland, which starts on 2 July, where England are defending champions. She will be without goalkeeper Mary Earps and midfielder Fran Kirby, who have both retired from international football, while defender Millie Bright, who captained the side to the World Cup final in 2023, withdrew from selection to focus on her mental and physical wellbeing. The loss of three players, who have won a combined 217 caps, in such a short time has led to a potentially unsettling period for the Lionesses - and distractions off the pitch dominated discussions at the end of their Women's Nations League campaign this week. ""Yeah, of course, [it] has been hard,"" said Wiegman. ""I think there are three different stories and every story is one on its own.  ""[These are] players who have been with us for a long time, who I have been working with for a long time and so that's hard."" But the Dutchwoman says she is happy with the atmosphere inside the England camp. ""You [the media] see part of it, you are not in our environment all the time and I can ensure that the training sessions were really good last week,"" she said. ""I didn't see anything [to suggest] that there were no connections within the team. I am really happy [with] where we are right now."" Wiegman had to address issues around player's performance-related bonuses in the build-up to the World Cup and there was also heavy scrutiny on her decision to omit former captain Steph Houghton from the Euro 2022 squad in her first year in charge.  ""My experiences before is that there is always noise. We expect noise until we go into the tournament,"" said Wiegman.  ""The difference is, between 2015 and 2017 to now, is that the attention and visibility of the women's game has increased so much. ""It seems like there is more noise but there's just more journalists here. Which is right. It shows what we are doing. We have to deal with it and move on. Which we have."" Sarina Wiegman is aiming to win a third successive Euros title as manager Wiegman said she was feeling ""good"" despite it being a week full of difficult decisions and conversations. Kirby's retirement followed Wiegman's decision not to include her in the Euros squad, while goalkeeper Earps was unhappy at her position as number two.  Wiegman said it is ""part of the job"" to endure those experiences but she can ""move forward"" to the Euros now. ""Yes, those hard conversations are not nice. I know what players do and how hard they work to make the squad. It's hard to give disappointing messages,"" she added.  ""At the same time, I also had very nice messages to give so that gives me more energy. ""After I have conversations with players, I always think, 'OK, what went well?' For me, it is really important that I am honest, that I treat people in the right way. ""Sometimes, you have very good news and, sometimes, you don't have good news - and I don't go around the bush with that.  ""I just give that message, then I can't always control how people respond to that. I just hope that they have the clarity to move on."" Wiegman also said part of the growth of women's football, and the success of the Lionesses, has added increased demands on her players. Bright's withdrawal has been a blow for England as Wiegman said the Chelsea captain would have been selected had she not ruled herself out. Asked when she was made aware of Bright's decision, she said: ""In the last couple of days I found out. It was sad and disappointing.  ""It's not nice when you don't feel well physically and mentally and I just hope she feels better soon.  ""England's profile is growing. That's life changing and very exciting but at the same time players are not robots. They have to deal with these things too.  ""That's also why we're trying to support them as well as possible on and off the pitch. Hopefully many players stay fit and healthy."" Head here to get involved Copyright Â© 2025 BBC.

2025-06-05,Article,News,US-Boeing deal over crashes 'repugnant' - lawyer for victims' families,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/c5y57p8xnp5o,"A lawyer for 16 families of the victims of a fatal Boeing 737 Max crash, has told the BBC that a deal between the aviation giant and the US Justice Department (DOJ) is ""morally repugnant"". The firm said it agreed to pay $1.1bn (£811.5m) to avoid prosecution over two crashes that killed 346 people, in a filing on Wednesday. Sanjiv Singh, counsel for family members of some of the victims of a 2018 crash in Indonesia, says the deal allows the firm to ""sidestep true criminal accountability"". Boeing has previously said: ""We are deeply sorry for their losses, and remain committed to honouring their loved ones' memories by pressing forward with the broad and deep changes to our company"". The deal includes the company paying $444.5m to families of crash victims. It will also put $455m towards improving its compliance, safety and quality programmes. Under the deal, Boeing also agreed to pay a criminal penalty of $487.2m, although half of that was already paid in 2021. ""Boeing is committed to complying with its obligations under this resolution, which include a substantial additional fine and commitments to further institutional improvements and investments,"" said a company spokesperson.  If the deal is approved by a federal judge the plane maker will avoid a criminal fraud trial. ""The [DOJ] agreed that it will not further criminally prosecute the company"", said Boeing in a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing. The BBC has contacted the DOJ to request further comment on the agreement. Two 737 Max aircraft crashed in separate but almost identical accidents that killed 346 people. In October 2018, all 189 people on a Lion Air flight died after the aircraft crashed into the Java Sea 13 minutes after take-off from Jakarta, Indonesia. In March 2019, an Ethiopian Airlines flight crashed six minutes after take-off from the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa. All 157 people on-board were killed. Both crashes were linked to faulty flight control systems. In 2021, Boeing agreed to settle US fraud charges and admitted deception over hiding information from safety officials about the design of its 737 Max planes. Relatives of the victims will have the chance to appeal this latest deal when it is considered by a federal judge. Mr Singh says the latest agreement has provoked ""visceral outrage"" from his clients and believes the current payout is insufficient. ""If you look at that $1.1bn, it's actually like Boeing paying $10 to escape criminal liability. It's as if they got a misdemeanour ticket or a parking ticket."" Copyright 2025 BBC.

2025-06-05,Article,News,Medicines watchdog to open 'digital hub' in city,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/ce8148d4k5jo,"The UK's drug safety watchdog is to open a new ""digital hub"" in West Yorkshire.  The site, to be located in Leeds city centre, would focus on digital delivery, software development and data science, according to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). The MHRA regulates new medicines, healthcare products and healthcare technologies for patients to use. Lawrence Tallon, MHRA chief executive, said opening the new site in the city was aimed at ""strengthening our ability to collaborate with partners across the north of England"". There had been a ""huge growth"" in healthcare technologies driven by changes in software and AI which were going to revolutionise the way the NHS worked, and the new Leeds hub would help regulate those technologies, Mr Tallon said. Leeds was chosen for the new hub as it was home to over 44,000  tech professionals and about 11,000 students studying tech-related subjects, according to the MHRA. The hub, in Wellington Place, would also serve as a base for the digital operations of NHS England, with increasing investment from major tech companies, an MHRA spokesperson said. About 30 permanent, highly-skilled roles would initially be recruited to work at the new centre in the city, they added. Wes Streeting, secretary of state for health and social care, said: ""There is a global tech revolution in healthcare unfolding, and Yorkshire will help our country lead it.  ""This isn't just about creating new jobs across the region, it's also about bolstering a city that's already leading the way in digital health."" Mr Tallon said that by establishing an MHRA digital hub in Leeds, ""we're strengthening our ability to collaborate with partners across the north of England – bringing regulatory expertise closer to the people, organisations and innovations we serve"". Meanwhile, he said Leeds was ""buzzing, thriving, an exciting place"". ""We are really excited about create new jobs within our organisation right in the heart of Leeds,"" Mr Tallon added. Fiona Venner, Leeds City Council's executive member for equality, health and wellbeing, said the MHRA's announcement of the plan for a digital hub was ""welcome"". ""Leeds is already a centre for digital health and innovation and this rapidly growing market contributes significantly to the economy,"" she said. ""The hub will support the creation of jobs and provide career opportunities for local graduates and professionals.""

2025-06-05,Article,News,Women warned weight-loss jabs may affect the pill,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/cn0gp2pl7zwo,"Women using weight-loss jabs have been warned by the UK's medicines regulator that they must use effective contraception. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) says it is not known whether taking the medicines, such as Wegovy and Mounjaro, could harm an unborn baby. It also warns that weight-loss jabs may make the contraceptive pill less likely to work in those who are overweight or obese. There are concerns that the growing popularity of 'skinny jabs' means many women aren't using the drugs safely or getting the right advice. It's thought the contraceptive pill may not be absorbed properly due to common side-effects of the jabs such as vomiting and diarrhoea, and because they slow the emptying of the stomach.  The MHRA says women should use contraception while taking GLP-1 medicines and for a certain period afterwards before trying to become pregnant - two months for Wegovy and Ozempic, and one month for Mounjaro. It also advises that those using Mounjaro and taking an oral contraceptive should also use a condom for four weeks after starting the drug, or switch to another method such as the coil or implant.  Advice on contraception already appears in patient information leaflets that come with the medicines, but the MHRA has now issued its own guidance. The drugs safety body says weight-loss injections must not be taken: Women should be told this information when they starting taking the jabs, but there are fears the message is not getting through. Natasha Major, 26, started using Mounjaro to lose weight before planning to try for her third baby in a few years' time, but was shocked six weeks later to find she was pregnant. She was taking the contraceptive pill at the time. ""I have polycystic ovaries as well, so I can't get pregnant easily or quickly. So it was an even bigger shock that I had, which didn't make any sense to me,"" she says. She then worried she could be harming the baby or it would not develop properly. Natasha rang her GP for advice and was told to stop taking it. ""We're over the initial shock now and really happy, just wasn't expected,"" she says.  ""The last injection I took, I found out about the pregnancy three hours later and haven't taken it since then. ""I've had an early scan to make sure the pregnancy was viable and okay - baby had a little heartbeat and everything looks good,"" Natasha says.  The MHRA, as well as doctors and pharmacists, are worried that popular GLP-1 medicines, known as Wegovy, Mounjaro, Saxenda, Victoza and Ozempic, are not being used safely. These prescription medicines, which are licensed to treat obesity (and Ozempic for type 2 diabetes), make people feel full by mimicking a hormone released after eating. Mounjaro also acts on another hormone linked to appetite and blood sugar control. They are only available on the NHS to people with a very high BMI, but can also be bought privately from high street and online chemists. Such is the demand for the jabs, they are also being sold illegally on social media and from beauty salons, without any medical advice or prescription, as a quick fix to lose weight.  The MHRA advises people to have a conversation with their prescriber about the risks and benefits of taking them, and understand the potential side-effects by talking to a doctor or pharmacist. It has acted now because it has received around 40 reports relating to pregnancy made to its Yellow Card scheme, where the public can report suspected side-effects of medicines. Some of these have been unintended pregnancies. Dr Alison Cave, chief safety officer at the MHRA, said there was evidence from animal studies ""that these medicines may harm the unborn baby"". ""But we don't know whether we have the same effects in humans, so much more data is needed to determine that."" Women of child-bearing age are usually not included in clinical trials, which is why there is a lack of safety information for them. ""If you are taking this medicine and you are pregnant, you should talk to your doctor about stopping the medicine as soon as possible,"" Dr Cave said. Sukhi Basra, vice-chairwoman of the National Pharmacy Association, said women should visit their pharmacist for advice if they are confused about when to stop using the drugs, and always buy them from an official pharmacy. Dr Bassel Wattar, pregnancy expert and consultant at Epsom and St Helier University Hospitals, said the implant or the intrauterine coil offered ""more robust contraception"" than the oral combined contraceptive pill while taking the injections. Losing a lot of weight can sometimes help some women restore natural ovulation and boost their chances of becoming pregnant, but he said this should be planned under the care of specialist doctors ""to ensure a pregnancy can be planned safely after a washout period off these drugs"". BPAS, the British Pregnancy Advisory Service, says women in the UK ""face significant challenges"" when trying to access their contraceptive method of choice. A lack of appointments, long waiting lists and high costs are just some of the barriers they face, BPAS said, as it called for a better plan for providing the choice women need.

2025-06-05,Article,News,"Charli XCX, Snow Patrol and Stereophonics among Belsonic headline acts",https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/cd7gp2je5ewo,"More than 100,000 music lovers are expected to gather at Belfast's Ormeau Park in the next few weeks for Belsonic.  The annual outdoor music festival kicks off on Thursday night and runs until the end of the month.  The first headliners are Welsh band Stereophonics.  ""Hopefully it doesn't rain. We'll be all right.... we've got our raincoats,"" lead singer Kelly Jones told BBC Radio Ulster's Vinny & Cate show. Jones said a recent world tour proves they are not a band that relies on ""being a phase"" from the 1990s and that their music ""is still appealing to new audiences"".  ""There are kids in the front row,"" he added.   Snow Patrol, Alanis Morissette, Charli XCX, the DJ BLK and Justin Timberlake are among a host of other big names set to take to the stage this year. Lush! Classical, featuring the Ulster Orchestra, are headlining on Saturday while Catfish and the Bottlemen are performing the following Saturday (15 June).  Justin Timberlake will perform on 26 June, supported by Jess Glynne. For dance music fans, the Boiler Room will see Dutch DJ and producer Chris Stussy team up with KETTAMA, a DJ and producer from Galway, on 28 June.  Alanis Morissette will wrap up the festival on 30 June.  Festival director Alan Simms said when deciding on the acts they aim for ""a broad range of music that appeals to as broad a range of people as possible"".  He said personally he was looking forward to seeing Snow Patrol as they had been trying to get them for many years but for ""diaries and for other reasons it hasn't panned out"" in the past.   The gates at Ormeau Park will open at 18:00 BST and close at 21:45 BST. Belsonic says the curfew is usually about 23:00 BST but times will be posted on social media on the day of the event. Translink says while there will be no special shuttle buses in Belfast for the gigs, scheduled Metro bus services connect with Ormeau Park. If you are travelling from the north west, special Goldliner coach services are operating from and to Foyle Street Buscentre in Londonderry for all of the events, with the exception of the Madness concert.  There will also be additional rail services running throughout Belsonic. Further information is available here.  Ormeau Embankment is set to be closed from Ravenhill Road to Ormeau Road from 16:00 BST on the dates of the gigs. It will remain closed for a period after each concert, so the public is asked to be aware of this if arranging a safe collection location. Details about accessibility parking and facilities during Belsonic are available here. The Lush Classical, BLK and Boiler Room gigs are strictly over 16s only and Belsonic says valid ID will be required. Under 16s can attend all the other performances, but will require a parent or guardian who is also a ticket holder to accompany them.  There are also some age restrictions on who can enter the front standing section.  Copyright 2025 BBC.

2025-06-05,Article,News,200-year-old condom 'in mint condition' says museum,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/c1de271qg4yo,"An almost 200-year-old condom - in ""mint condition"" - has just gone on display at an exhibition at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. It is thought to be made of a sheep's appendix and features an explicit print representing a nun and three clergymen. The rare artefact dates back to 1830 and was purchased by the museum at an auction last year. The condom is part of an exhibition on 19th Century prostitution and sexuality. Prints, drawings and photographs also form part of the display. Rijksmuseum curator Joyce Zelen told the BBC when she and her colleague first spotted the condom at auction they ""were laughing"".  Ms Zelen said ""no-one else noticed it"" and they were the only ones who bid on it. After obtaining the item, they inspected it with UV light and ascertained that it had not been used.  ""It's in mint condition,"" said Ms Zelen.  Since it was put on display the museum has been packed with people - young and old - and the ""response has been amazing"", she added. Ms Zelen explained the condom is believed to have been a ""luxury souvenir"" from a fancy brothel in France, and that only two such objects are known to have survived to the present day. The museum said the unusual item ""embodies both the lighter and darker sides of sexual health, in an era when the quest for sensual pleasure was fraught with fears of unwanted pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases – especially syphilis"". The explicit print on this specific object shows the nun sitting in front of the three men with her dress up and her legs apart pointing her finger at the clergymen, all of whom are standing in front of her holding up their habits. The condom also bears the inscription ""Voilà mon choix"", meaning ""There is my choice"". The museum noted the print is thus to be considered as a ""parody of both celibacy and the Judgement of Paris from Greek mythology"", the latter being the mythological story of a Trojan Prince named Paris who had to decide who was the fairest goddess among Aphrodite, Hera and Athena. The Dutch museum notes that their Print Room collection holds some 750,000 prints, drawings and photographs but that this is the first example in the collection of a print on a condom. ""As far as we can tell we are the only art museum with a printed condom,"" said Ms Zelen.  She said her institution was ""open to loan"" the artefact out to other museums, but noted that the condom was very delicate. It will be on display until the end of November. Copyright 2025 BBC.

2025-06-05,Article,Travel,Jimmy Choo's well-heeled guide to Kuala Lumpur,https://www.bbc.com//travel/article/20250602-jimmy-choos-guide-to-kuala-lumpur,"His shoes ignited a worldwide sartorial revolution, but he hangs his hat in KL. Here are his top hometown experiences, from enjoying street food to designing your own bespoke suit. Home to the Petronas Twin towers and one of the world's most recognisable skylines, the Malaysian capital has evolved over the last four decades from a modest metropolis known for its charming colonial architecture to a thriving, ultra-modern city. Born in Penang, Jimmy Choo grew up in a family of shoemakers and crafted his first pair aged 11. He studied footwear design in London and shot to fame in the 1990s when he founded his eponymous brand and Princess Diana became a loyal client. In 2021, Choo opened the Jimmy Choo Academy fashion school in Mayfair to nurture the next generation of design talents. The academy's graduate exposition show takes place on 9 June 2025. (Credit: Tet Leon Lee) ""Many years ago, when I came to Kuala Lumpur for the first time, it wasn't as modern,"" says legendary shoe designer Jimmy Choo, who hails from Penang, an island on Malaysia's north-western coast. ""It has changed a lot. There are now lots of high-rise apartments and hotels and it's a lot more multicultural.""  The perennially fashionable Choo, who splits his time between London and Kuala Lumpur where he owns a penthouse apartment a stone's throw from the Petronas Towers in the upmarket KLCC (Kuala Lumpur City Centre) neighbourhood, says the city has also become a major destination for fashion fans on the hunt for high-end bargains. ""A lot of people come here to shop because we have a lot of designer shops and the prices are not too high,"" he says. ""Whether you want to buy shoes, bags, accessories – you can get them all in KL."" If your budget won't stretch to luxury labels, Choo recommends seeking out homegrown talents. ""Malaysia has a lot of local designers who have been very well trained overseas,"" he says. ""They go to study fashion in places like the UK or Australia, then when they've finished their studies, they often come back to their own country to promote their designs."" Beyond retail therapy, the cosmopolitan city is famous for mouthwatering street food from all corners of Asia and plentiful people-watching opportunities at fancy rooftop bars, where you can show off your designer finery while sipping an ice-cold cocktail.  Here are Choo's favourite places for shopping, dining and drinking in the incredible views of Kuala Lumpur. Founded in 1974 by designer Robert Loh, Lord's Tailor specialises in custom suits for men and women and is beloved by many of Malaysia's most stylish celebrities. Kuala Lumpur benefits from balmy temperatures year-round, with monsoon season from November to March. ""I think May to October is the best time to come for a holiday,"" Choo says. ""During rainy season, the weather can be very difficult to predict."" ""It was recently the 50th anniversary of the designer Robert, who learned tailoring and design in London,"" says Choo, a loyal customer since the 1990s. ""Whenever I travel to different parts of the world, they will design all my outfits – daywear and evening wear.""  Providing exceptional sartorial skills at a fraction of the Savile Row price, the atelier's team of tailors and seamstresses can whip up a bespoke or made-to-measure suit in a matter of days.  ""They have their own factory, and all the staff have been very well trained,"" Choo says. ""If you go on a Monday for the measurements, they will have everything ready by Wednesday or Thursday to bring home."" How much will a Lord's Tailor suit set you back? ""It depends on the fabric you choose,"" says Choo. ""Prices start at around 3,000 ringgit (around £515) for a jacket and trousers with one shirt, going up to 10,000 ringgit (around £1,750) if you choose Italian fabric."" Website: www.lordstailor.com.my Address: F18 & F19, 1st floor, Bangsar Shopping Centre, 285 Jalan Maarof Phone: +6 017 670 7217 Instagram: @lordstailor/ A fashionista's paradise, glitzy Pavilion shopping centre is where you'll find the flagship stores of luxury brands such as Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Dior and Hermès alongside high street favourites like Zara and COS. ""Pavilion has got a lot of different brands so there's something to suit every budget,"" Choo says. ""For example, if you want to spend £30 on a shirt or trousers, or if you want to spend thousands and thousands on those higher-level designers."" To sample Malaysian style, try cool handbag brand Sembonia, trendy plus-size fashion pioneer Ms. Read, or Fipper, which sells rubber flip-flops in a vast array of colours. And if you've exhausted your options at Pavilion, pop over the road to another of Choo's favourite retail hotspots, The Starhill, a luxurious shopping centre home to the world's biggest watch gallery. Website: www.pavilion-kl.com Address: 168 Jalan Bukit Bintang Phone: +6 032 118 8833 Showcasing Malaysian handicraft techniques, the Kuala Lumpur Craft Complex is a series of buildings in the Terengganu style with gabled roofs and intricate wood carvings and features a museum where visitors can see how traditional textiles are woven and dyed. ""Batik is hand-painted and uses wax to create the designs,"" Choo explains. ""Songket comes in lots of different colours and has the gold and silver thread woven through. It's quite expensive because it takes some time to weave by hand."" Typically worn on formal occasions, a songket outfit usually comprises a baju kurung long-sleeved shirt, a sarong or trousers, a sampin decorative scarf around the waist and a songkok cap for men. ""Usually when I'm attending my birthday event I wear songket because one of my students designs with songket material,"" Choo says. ""It's common at Malaysian weddings as well. When government people go to functions, they usually wear batik."" Travellers can purchase songket and batik fabric as well as readymade garments and accessories in the Karyaneka Boutique at the Kuala Lumpur Craft Complex. Website: www.kraftangan.gov.my Address: Section 63, Jalan Conlay Phone: +6 032 162 7459 Instagram: @kraftanganmalaysia To refuel after all that shopping, cheap – and delicious – eats are just a five-minute taxi ride from the city's major shopping centres to Chinatown; namely, Petaling Street Market. When packing for a trip to Kuala Lumpur, be sure to include some light layers, Choo advises. ""Outside, it's humid and hot, so you can wear a T-shirt and shorts, but when you go into a shopping mall, cafe or restaurant, it's all air conditioned, so you need something to wear on top. For some reason, cinemas are always very cold, you almost need a winter jacket!"" Reflecting Kuala Lumpur's history as a trading hub since the 6th Century, the market features a blend of Malay, Indian, and Chinese cuisine with hints of Arab, Thai and Portuguese flavours to boot. Choo lists his favourite Petaling Street eats: ""I love char kway teow [stir-fried flat noodles], Hainanese chicken with rice, roti canai [flaky Malaysian flatbread], nasi lemak [rice cooked in coconut milk and pandan leaves served with chilli paste, anchovies and boiled egg], and nasi kandar, which is chicken with spicy curry sauce."" For dessert, he suggests sniffing out a helping of durian, the divisive yellow-fleshed fruit with a spiky exterior and a distinctive aroma. ""Some people like it, some don't,"" says Choo. ""They say it smells like cheese or something like that. But you cannot bring it back to the hotel, they won't allow it because it smells so strong!"" Address: Jalan Petaling, City Centre While many of Kuala Lumpur's rooftop bars look down on the city, WET Deck at the W Hotel is situated on the 12th floor, meaning the neighbouring Petronas Twin Towers provide a dramatic and glittering backdrop when night falls.  ""If I want to have a drink and some good western or Malay food, I normally go to W Hotel bar,"" Choo says. ""You can sit by the swimming pool and see the Twin Towers right in front of you. It's a place you can relax and take some nice pictures. You can see the whole of KL.""  Choo's tipple of choice is a nod to his international lifestyle. ""People in Malaysia like to drink cognac and whisky,"" he says. ""But my favourite drink is actually a very English one; I love a lager and lime.""  A minimum spend of 500 ringgit (around £90) per table is required at WET Deck on Friday and Saturday nights, so choose a weeknight if you're looking for a more affordable option. Website: www.wkualalumpur-wetdeck.com Address: W Kuala Lumpur, 121 Jalan Ampang Phone: +6 012 365 4188 Instagram: @wetdeckkualalumpur An urban oasis nestled among the skyscrapers, KLCC Park is popular with city dwellers and tourists alike. With a jogging track, children's playground and wading pool, it's great for families, or anyone who wants a breather and a shady spot to escape the heat.  ""You can have a beautiful morning walk in the park or go for a run, you can see water features and birds during the day,"" says Choo. ""And at night it's very romantic. You often see couples walking around the lake."" Open from 10:00 to 22:00, with the main entrance on Jalan Ampang, the park also offers a brilliant vantage point to grab some snaps as the sun sets and the skyscrapers light up.

2025-06-05,Article,Travel,The women saving Japan's vanishing cuisine,https://www.bbc.com//travel/article/20250530-the-women-saving-japans-vanishing-cuisine,"For 450 years, the little-known Ryukyu Kingdom thrived in what is now Japan. Now, after nearly vanishing, its unique fusion cuisine is being revived. ""You can learn a lot about a person by looking at their tongue,"" Yukie Miyaguni tells me in the kitchen-classroom of her second-storey apartment in Uruma, a city on the Japanese island of Okinawa. I've taken a few cooking classes over the years, but this is the first time anyone's ever asked to examine my tongue. With my mouth agape, Miyaguni – a Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) practitioner and Ryukyuan chef – gives my tongue a long look before drawing its likeness on a whiteboard and offering a prescription: ""More cacao at night, honey in the morning and more butter,"" she concludes, noting it will help improve my blood circulation and dry skin.  I didn't come to Okinawa for a diagnosis per se, but in many ways, it was my taste buds that led me to Miyaguni's kitchen. I had been hoping to learn more about the island's elusive and indigenous Ryukyuan cuisine, which can be traced back to the 12th Century when the Ryukyu Islands began trading with other East Asian states. The Ryukyu Islands stretch more than 1,100km, from the southern tip of Kyushu to north-eastern Taiwan. From 1429-1879, the archipelago flourished as a semi-autonomous state known as the Ryukyu Kingdom and was an important cross-section of maritime trade during its 450-year history. Over time, the islands developed a distinctive cultural and culinary identity that blended endemic ingredients like bitter melon, shikuwasa (a lime-like citrus fruit), beni-imo (purple sweet potatoes) and mozuku seaweed with non-native cooking techniques and ingredients. Siamese (modern-day Thai) traders brought indica rice; the Chinese introduced a variety of herbs, teas and pork; and Korean merchants taught residents how to pickle and ferment seafood and vegetables. BBC.com's World's Table ""smashes the kitchen ceiling"" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future. As Miyaguni explained, when the Kingdom's royal family welcomed visiting envoys and magistrates, they did so with a refined style of cooking and customs called ""court cuisine"" (Ukwanshin Ryori), in which portions of hana-ika (sliced squid), minudaru (steamed pork in seasame sauce), gunbomachi (burdock root wrapped in pork) and more were presented in a Ryukyuan lacquerware called a tundabun. When Japan annexed and renamed the island chain Okinawa in 1879, court cuisine spread from the upper echelons of Ryukyuan society to the countryside. Everyday households continued to pass down home-cooked recipes from the islands' more relaxed ""folk cuisine"" as well. But when US forces occupied Okinawa for several decades after World War Two, a mixture of American fast food influence, a rapid assimilation to Japanese culture, food shortages and economic hardships led to the near disappearance of the islands' ancient fusion food culture. Now, thanks to a growing contingent of women like Miyaguni, a resurgence of Ryukyuan cuisine is quietly underway. ""This was the food of our ancestors,"" Miyaguni says, slicing into a pimply green bitter gourd called goya and tossing it into a small mixing bowl along with tofu, eggs and pork to make a traditional style of stir fry called champaru. Meaning ""to mix together"", champaru dishes are often considered the spirit of Okinawa because they reflect the islands' diverse influences. ""By cooking this way,"" Miyaguni continued, ""we honour their [memories] and keep this ancient culture alive."" As with traditional Japanese cuisine on the mainland, Ryukyuan food is rooted in locally sourced and seasonal ingredients. Dishes and ingredients like goya champaru, jimami (peanut) tofu, slow-boiled agu (pork) and umibudo (sea grapes) served in tundabun or Okinawan pottery called yachimun are integral to keeping the traditions of Ryukyuan court cuisine and folk cuisine alive. ""Ryukyuan cuisine is not colourful, so using these plates and lacquerware helped make the food look more vivid,"" Miyaguni explained, pointing to the fire engine-red tundabuncontaining each dish on the table. After we finished kneading the dough for chinsuko (a traditional Okinawan shortbread made of lard, flour and sugar) and placed it in the oven, we sat down to enjoy the fruits of our labour. As I savoured delicate bites of buttery soft peanut tofu, slices of black sesame-coated pork loin and mung bean rice balls wrapped in banana leaves, Miyaguni explained the health benefits of Ryukyuan food. She said ingredients like bitter melon and purple sweet potatoes are high in antioxidants and help lower blood sugar and aid digestion, while awamori, a locally distilled spirit, can aid in gut health. Miyaguni's interest in preserving Ryukyuan food culture is rooted in the Chinese philosophy of food as medicine. After retiring as a nutritionist at a hospital in Okinawa in 2008, Miyaguni encountered TCM and began to learn about its ""deep connection"" to Ryukyuan cuisine. For the last 10 years, Miyaguni has been teaching locals and visitors about the health components of Ryukyuan cuisine from her home. In 2018, she was selected as a representative of Ryukyuan cuisine by the Okinawa Prefectural Governor. ""Until now, Okinawa has been the pride of the world as the island of longevity. However, now the health of the people is deteriorating,"" Miyaguni said. Miyaguni explained that even after the islands were annexed, Ryukyuan folk cuisine was still governed by the Chinese philosophy of ishoku dogen, which emphasises the importance of using high-quality, seasonally available ingredients. Homemade tofu, mugwort soup, purple potato and bitter melon remained staples of folk cuisine, along with the Confucian belief of using all parts of the pig. ""Everything but the oink,"" Miyaguni said. Today, Miyaguni still keeps a book in her kitchen called Gozen Honzō (Edible Plants of Ryukyu), which was written by a chief physician to the king of the Ryukyuan Kingdom. ""Gozen Honzō… explains the types of and used of edible plants, animals and many other foods and a number of sections describe methods of preparing them,"" Miyaguni said. ""We've lost the Ryukyuan language because it isn't taught, but understanding how our ancestors cooked, and teaching these traditions is how we will continue to protect the Ryukyuan culture for future generations,"" she added. While Miyaguni's interest in preserving Ryukyuan cuisine stems from her medicinal background, Kazumi Kayo, a Ryukyuan cooking instructor and food culture ambassador for the Okinawa Prefecture, says her interest in reviving these culinary traditions goes back to her mother. ""When I was young, I was not interested in Ryukyuan cuisine,"" Kayo said. ""However, the memory of the taste that my mother made for me since I was a child came back to me, and I wanted to maintain a cooking method that brought out the taste of these simple ingredients, so I specialised in cooking, obtained a qualification and started a cooking class.""  But Kayo is aware that the region's famous longevity – which many believe is inextricably linked to its diet – is increasingly in peril.  ""For a long time, Okinawa prefecture has maintained the world's longest life expectancy, but with the Westernisation of food, that ranking has dropped, and now the number of people suffering from lifestyle-related diseases is increasing, which is a problem for the prefecture,"" Kayo said.  In 2016, Okinawa's prefectural government developed a programme called Ryukyuan Cuisine Masters to help preserve Ryukyuan food while also addressing rising health concerns. ""About five years ago, we strengthened training for chefs in the food and beverage industry and nutrition associations, provided them with qualifications and started activities to pass on and popularise Ryukyuan cuisine, including traditional cooking methods,"" Kayo added. ""I think the residents of the prefecture will realise the goodness of Ryukyuan cuisine again.""  Now in her 18th year as a Ryukyuan cooking instructor, Kayo runs the Yonner Food Cooking Studio, whose classes start by taking locals and visitors to Makishi Public Market in downtown Naha. ""Yonnerfood' means 'slow food' in Okinawan dialect, and by having a leisurely chat while shopping and taking a cooking class, I hope to help people learn about Okinawa's food culture and develop a love for Okinawa,"" Kayo said.  More like this: • Japan's spectacular bike ride through six remote islands • The eight Asian sauces to keep in your pantry • Japan's 97-year-old cherry blossom guardian In 2019, in an effort to further prevent the decline of Ryukyuan cuisine, the non-profit Ryukyu Cuisine Preservation Association was established to safeguard and promote the culinary heritage of the Ryukyu Kingdom. The same year, ""The Unbroken Legacy of the Ryukyu Kingdom"" and its unique food culture was registered as a national heritage of Japan. In addition to educational cooking classes like Miyaguni's and Kayo's, a handful of Ryukyuan restaurants and food tours have also cropped up across the islands.  Local tour guide Junko Yokoo's Blue Zone Okinawa Home Cooking Tour takes guests to the home of Hiromi Nerome, another certified Ryukyuan cuisine specialist and chef whose own cooking class is based out of her home in the seaside village of Nakijin. ""I started offering this tour in 2022 in response to tourists' interest in Okinawa's 'longevity' cuisine,"" Yokoo tells me. ""Locally grown vegetables like bitter melon and purple sweet potato are quite different from mainland Japan, so people are curious to taste them and learn about what makes Okinawan food so healthy."" In 2024, Suitenrou opened in downtown Naha and offers a mix of Ryukyuan folk and court cuisine along with traditional music and dancing. For a more formal court cuisine-inspired affair, Kuninda also in downtown Naha serves classic dishes like stewed pork cubes in white miso and sea grapes topped with freshly grated wasabi. But if you ask Miyaguni or Kayo, they will tell you that the key to preserving Ryukyuan food culture starts in the kitchen and is best learned through hands-on experience. ""I think that if we can spread the word and attract attention outside the prefecture and abroad, the people of the prefecture will once again realise the goodness of Ryukyuan cuisine,"" Kayo said. ""If Ryukyuan cuisine disappears, we will lose the identity of Okinawa, so we must preserve it.""  -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.  For more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.

2025-06-05,Article,News,Giant 1970s cheese plant rehomed at indoor zoo,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/c7715djgr82o,"A giant cheese plant which has been growing at a Leeds medical school since the 1970s has been rehomed at a nearby indoor zoo. The monster Monstera - named Audrey after the blood-sucking antagonist of the 1986 film Little Shop of Horrors - had lived in the stairwell of Old Medical School at Leeds General Infirmary. Due to building work at the site, the 3m (10ft) tall plant has now been rehoused at nearby Tropical World in Roundhay, which boasts the largest collection of tropical plants outside Kew Gardens. Visitor attraction manager Jo Langton said moving Audrey had been a ""massive challenge"" but they were ""determined to do everything we could to rescue her"". Audrey needed to be trimmed back before she was able to be moved, but has now been replanted in the Rainforest Canopy area. Once established, the NHS plans to install a plaque to explain her history. Ms Langton said: ""She's going to need a lot of TLC and it's still early days, but fortunately we do have an established cheese plant here already which grows extremely well, so we all have our fingers crossed that she'll adapt to her new surroundings. ""We also know that Audrey has quite a following on social media, so we're happy to share that she's still around in Leeds and would love visitors to come along and see her settling in."" Native to central and south America, monstera can grow up to a height of 20m (66ft) in the wild, climbing trees by using a network of aerial roots which hooks over branches. Mohammed Rafique, Leeds City Council's executive member for climate, energy, environment and green space, said: ""It's wonderful that we've been able to give Audrey a new home so her story can continue, and we can preserve a little bit of Leeds history for visitors so enjoy too.""
