6/5/2025,Article,News,Trump and Musk enter bitter feud - and Washington buckles up,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/c3wd2215q08o,"What happens when the richest person and the most powerful politician have a knock-down, drag-out fight? The world may be about to find out. A disagreement between Elon Musk and Donald Trump started at a simmer last week, began bubbling on Wednesday and is now in full-on boil. And like everything these two men do, it is all spilling out into public view. These two men have two of the world's biggest megaphones, and they clearly enjoy using them. In remarks at the Oval Office on Thursday afternoon, Trump sounded a bit like a spurned lover. He expressed surprise at Musk's criticism of his ""big, beautiful"" tax and spending legislation. He pushed back against the notion that he would have lost last year's presidential election without Musk's hundreds of millions of dollars in support. And he said Musk was only changing his tune now because his car company, Tesla, will be hurt by the Republican push to end electric vehicle tax credits. Musk took to his social media site, X, with a very Generation X response for his 220 million followers: ""Whatever"". He said he didn't care about the car subsidies, he wanted to shrink the national debt, which he says is an existential threat to the nation. He called Trump ""ungrateful"" for his help last year and insisted that Democrats would have prevailed without him. Musk and Trump had formed a powerful but unlikely alliance , culminating in the tech billionaire having a key position of budget-slashing authority in the Trump administration. Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, or Doge, became one of the biggest stories of Trump's first 100 days, as it shuttered entire agencies and dismissed thousands of government workers. It wasn't long, however, before speculation began over when – and how - the two outsized personalities would ultimately fall out. For a while, it seemed like those predictions were off the mark. Trump stood by Musk even as the latter's popularity dropped, as he feuded with administration officials and as he became a liability in several key elections earlier this year. Every time it appeared there would be a break, Musk would pop up in the Oval Office, or the Cabinet room or on the president's Air Force One flight to Mar-a-Lago. When Musk's 130 days as a ""special government employee"" ended last week, the two had a chummy Oval Office send-off, with hints that Musk might someday return. It's safe to say that any invitation has been rescinded. ""Elon and I had a great relationship,"" Trump said on Thursday – a comment notable for its use of the past tense. There had been some thought that Trump's surprise announcement on Wednesday night of a new travel ban, additional sanctions on Harvard and a conspiracy-laced administration investigation of former President Joe Biden were all efforts to change the subject from Musk's criticism. The White House and its allies in Congress seemed careful not to further antagonise him after his earlier comments. Then Trump spoke out and … so much for that. Now the question is where the dispute goes next. Congressional Republicans could find it harder to keep their members behind Trump's bill with Musk providing rhetorical – and, perhaps financial – air for those who break ranks.  Trump, who takes pride in being a devastating counterpuncher, will have plenty of opportunity to lay into Musk. What will happen to Musk's Doge allies still in the Trump administration or government contracts to Musk-related companies or Biden-era investigations into Musk's business dealings? ""The easiest way to save money in our budget, billions and billions of dollars, is to terminate Elon's governmental subsidies and contracts,"" Trump posted menacingly on his own social media website. If Trump turns the machinery of government against Musk, the tech billionaire will feel pain. Tesla's stock price slipped on Thursday.  But Musk also has near limitless resources to respond, including by funding insurgent challengers to Republicans in next year's elections and primaries. He may not win a fight against the whole of Trump's government, but he could exact a high political price. Meanwhile, Democrats are on the sidelines, wondering how to respond. Few seem willing to welcome Musk, a former donor to their party, back into the fold. But there's also the old adage that the enemy of an enemy is a friend. ""It's a zero-sum game,"" Liam Kerr, a Democratic strategist, told Politico. ""Anything that he does that moves more toward Democrats hurts Republicans."" At the very least, Democrats seem happy to stand back and let the two men exchange blows. And until they abandon this fight, the din is likely to drown out everything else in American politics. But don't expect this spat to end anytime soon. ""Trump has 3.5 years left as president,"" Musk wrote on X, ""but I will be around for 40-plus years."" Copyright 2025 BBC.

6/5/2025,Article,News,"Trump's new ban dodges pitfalls faced by last attempt, experts say",https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/cd7gp8l1241o,"US President Donald Trump has issued a sweeping new travel ban for people from 12 countries, revisiting a hallmark policy of his first term in office. There are some key differences, however. The original travel ban suffered a series of legal defeats. This time, the policy appears to have been designed to avoid the same pitfalls. Its predecessor, which targeted seven predominantly Muslim countries and was dubbed the ""Muslim ban"" by critics, was ordered just a week after Trump took office in 2017, during his first term in the White House. The ban was amended twice to overcome court challenges, after opponents argued it was unconstitutional and illegal because it discriminated against travellers based on their religion. A scaled-back version was eventually upheld by the US Supreme Court in 2018, which this new ban closely resembles. Legal experts told the BBC that it appeared Trump had learned lessons from his first attempt. Christi Jackson, an expert in US immigration law at the London firm Laura Devine Immigration, said the new ban was more legally robust as a result. While the first lacked ""clarity"", the new restrictions were ""wider in scope"" and had ""clearly defined"" exemptions, she said. While there are some similarities in the nations chosen by the 2017 ban and the 2025 ban, Muslim-majority states are not the express target of the latest order. Barbara McQuade, professor of law at the University of Michigan and former US attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan, told the BBC World Service's Newshour programme that, on this basis, it seemed likely to win the approval of the Supreme Court if it was ever referred up to that level. The 12 countries subject to the harshest restrictions from 9 June are mainly in the Middle East, Africa and the Caribbean, including Afghanistan, Iran and Somalia. There will be partial restrictions on travellers from another seven countries, including Cuban and Venezuelan nationals. Trump said the strength of the restrictions would be graded against the severity of the perceived threat, including from terrorism. But besides Iran, none of the 12 countries hit by the outright ban are named on the US government's state sponsors of terrorism list. Trump cited Sunday's incident in Boulder, Colorado, in which a man was accused of throwing Molotov cocktails at demonstrators attending a march for Israeli hostages, in a video announcing the ban on X. The alleged attacker was an Egyptian national. However, Egypt does not appear on either list.  Trump also specified high rates of people overstaying their visas as a reason for listing certain countries. However, Steven D Heller, an immigration lawyer based in the US, said there was a ""lack of clarity"" over what threshold had to be met by a country's overstaying rate in order for that country to be placed on Trump's ban list. That could be the basis for a successful legal challenge, he suggested. ""If they're relying on this notion of excessive overstay rates... they have to define what that actually means,"" he told the BBC. But he noted that existing US law gave the president broad powers over immigration policy. Unlike the first ban, which was to last for only 90 to 120 days, today's order has no end date. It has been met with dismay in the targeted countries.  Venezuela has described the Trump administration as ""supremacists who think they own the world"", though Somalia has pledged to ""engage in dialogue to address the concerns raised"". The original ban spurred mass protests and sowed chaos at US airports.  It was repealed in 2021 by Trump's successor, President Joe Biden, who called the policy ""a stain on our national conscience"". Immigration lawyer Shabnam Lotfi, who challenged the previous travel ban, said it would be an ""uphill battle"" to overturn the new one.  ""The president does have the authority to determine who is admissible to the US,"" she said, adding that because of the way the ban had been written, it was ""harder to find a huge group of people that could file a class-action lawsuit"". ""They've put more thought into it."" Ms Lotfi noted that the new restrictions could have consequences for students and other visa applicants abroad. ""Students who are stuck in administrative processing are impacted. So are winners of the diversity visa lottery who paid fees and went to interviews - they're unlikely to get visas now,"" she said. ""Even EB-5 investors - people who've put over $1 million into the US economy - are affected. And H-1B visa holders stuck abroad, waiting to return to their US employers, could also be blocked.""

6/5/2025,Article,News,Israeli military recovers two hostages' bodies in southern Gaza,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/c989rl23zzno,"Israeli forces have recovered the bodies of two Israeli-Americans taken back to Gaza as hostages during the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, the Israeli military says. Judi Weinstein Haggai, 70, who was also a Canadian citizen, and her husband Gadi Haggai, 72, were murdered by gunmen from the Mujahideen Brigades group when they attacked Kibbutz Nir Oz, a statement said. Their bodies were found in the southern Khan Younis area of Gaza overnight and brought back to Israel for forensic identification. There are now 56 hostages still being held by Hamas in Gaza, at least 20 of whom are believed to be alive. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he and his wife sent their condolences to the families of Judi and Gadi Haggai. ""Our hearts grieve over this terrible loss. May their memories be blessed,"" he added. ""I would like to thank, and express appreciation to, the fighters and commanders for this determined and successful operation. We will not rest, nor will we be silent, until we return home all of our hostages - the living and the deceased."" The couple's families recalled how they ""went out for a walk on the morning of that cursed Saturday and never returned"". ""We welcome the closure and their return to a proper burial at home, in Israel,"" they said. Judi, an English teacher, and Gadi Haggai, who used to work in Kibbutz Nir Oz's kitchen, were last seen alive in a video they shared with a group chat at the start of the 7 October attack. They were seen taking cover in a field as incoming rockets fired from Gaza streaked overhead and the sound of gunfire was heard. Judi later told friends and relatives they had been wounded, before ceasing contact. The couple's daughter Iris Weinstein Haggai said after the attack her mother had told her they had been ""shot by terrorists on a motorcycle and that my dad was wounded really bad"". She added: ""Paramedics tried to send her an ambulance. The ambulance got hit by a rocket."" In December 2023, the kibbutz announced that both Judi and Gadi were killed that day and their bodies were being held hostage in Gaza. On Wednesday, an Israeli military official said the couple's bodies were recovered from the Khan Younis area following an operation based on ""precise intelligence"" from the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and the Shin Bet security service. They said they could not disclose further details due to the sensitivity of the operation. However, Israeli Army Radio reported the intelligence was obtained through the Shin Bet's interrogation of a Palestinian fighter captured by Israeli troops in Gaza. ""We will keep doing the utmost for the mission of bringing our hostages back - the living, to reunite with their families, and the deceased to dignified burial. We will deploy all the methods and tools in our disposal for this goal,"" the military official said. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum urged decision-makers to do everything they could to agree a new ceasefire deal with Hamas to secure the return of all the remaining hostages. ""There is no need to wait another 608 agonising days for this,"" it said. ""The mission can be completed as early as tomorrow morning. This is what the majority of the Israeli people want."" US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said he was ""united in prayer"" for the Haggai family. ""Hamas must release all remaining hostages, including Omer Neutra and Itay Chen,"" he added, referring to two other Israeli-Americans who the Israeli military says were killed on 7 October while serving as soldiers and whose bodies were taken back to Gaza. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said: ""The return of their remains is a time to begin to heal and to rest. We mourn with [Judi Haggai's] family. May her memory be a blessing."" Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza in response to the unprecedented cross-border attack almost 20 months ago, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. Another four people, two of them dead, were already being held captive in Gaza before the conflict. So far, 199 hostages have been returned, 148 of them alive, mostly through two temporary ceasefire deals with Hamas. At least 54,677 people have been killed in Gaza during the war, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Israel imposed a total blockade on Gaza on 2 March and resumed its military offensive against Hamas two weeks later, collapsing a two-month truce during which 33 Israeli hostages and five Thai hostages were freed. Israel said it wanted to put pressure on Hamas to release the remaining hostages. On 19 May, the Israeli military launched an expanded offensive that Netanyahu said would see troops ""take control of all areas"" of Gaza. Israel also partially eased its blockade, allowing some food into the territory amid warnings from experts of a looming famine. More than 4,400 people have reportedly been killed in Gaza over the past three months, while 640,000 others have been displaced again by Israeli ground operations and evacuation orders. Hopes of a new ceasefire deal faded last week, with Hamas and Israel remaining at odds over the conditions of the latest US proposal. Hamas said it was prepared to release 10 living hostages and the bodies of 18 dead ones, which was the number specified in US envoy Steve Witkoff's proposal, in exchange for a 60-day truce and the release of Palestinian prisoners. But the group also repeated its demands for guarantees that the truce would lead to a permanent ceasefire, as well as a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, and the resumption of unrestricted aid deliveries. Israel called Hamas's statement a refusal of the proposal, and Witkoff said it was totally unacceptable. But a Hamas official insisted it had acted positively and responsibly. Copyright 2025 BBC.

6/5/2025,Article,Sport,Sabalenka takes out Swiatek to reach French Open final,https://www.bbc.com//sport/tennis/articles/c93yxvwp1lvo,"Aryna Sabalenka has reached five of the past seven Grand Slam finals French Open 2025 Dates: 25 May-8 June Venue: Roland Garros Coverage: Live radio commentaries across 5 Live Sport and BBC Sounds, plus live text commentaries on the BBC Sport website and app World number one Aryna Sabalenka moved a step closer to a maiden French Open title by taking out four-time champion Iga Swiatek in a blockbuster semi-final. Sabalenka will meet second seed Coco Gauff in Saturday's showpiece after the American ruthlessly ended French wildcard Lois Boisson's incredible run. Belarus' Sabalenka earned a 7-6 (7-1) 4-6 6-0 victory to end fifth seed Swiatek's 26-match winning run at the tournament. After a slow start on the Roland Garros clay, Poland's Swiatek fought back to level but Sabalenka dominated a 22-minute deciding set. Sabalenka, whose three Grand Slam titles have all come on hard courts, has never reached the Paris final before. ""It feels incredible but the job is not done yet. I'm thrilled with my performance,"" the 27-year-old said. ""Iga is the toughest opponent, especially at Roland Garros, I'm proud I managed to get this win."" Gauff, runner-up to Swiatek in 2022, won 6-1 6-2 against world number 361 Boisson, who was appearing in her first Grand Slam main draw. This was the potential match that everyone had their eye on when the French Open draw was made: the 'Queen of Clay' against the world number one in the crunch stages. Swiatek and Sabalenka have claimed six of the past 10 majors between them and dominated the WTA Tour over the past three years. But with Swiatek dropping to fifth in the world after a turbulent season, it was Sabalenka who came into Roland Garros as the favourite. The magnitude of the eagerly-anticipated encounter appeared to affect both players in an edgy opening set. With the roof closed because of the wet weather in Paris, Sabalenka initially settled quicker in the heavier conditions that suit her game. The pace of Sabalenka's returning was too hot for Swiatek and allowed the top seed to quickly move a double break ahead. Swiatek took a step back in her baseline position to better absorb the pace and, after being a point away from going 5-1 behind, battled back. Iga Swiatek saw her serve broken eight times during the match The tweak helped a sharper Swiatek elongate the rallies and put more pressure on Sabalenka's serve, with the Pole winning the next three games to move 5-4 ahead. With both players looking tight, momentum continued to fluctuate. Swiatek's serve buckled, Sabalenka could not serve out the set at 6-5 and a nervy encounter was ultimately decided on a tie-break dominated by the Belarusian. Three successive breaks - down to quality returning as much as poor serving - began the second set before Swiatek settled down to maintain the advantage and force a decider. However, Swiatek's serve suddenly dropped off again and allowed Sabalenka to quickly reach her fifth final in the past seven Grand Slam tournaments. ""I think I lost my intensity a bit,"" said Swiatek. ""She played as strong as in the first set, but I didn't react to that well and just couldn't push back."" For the first time since 2011, fans had a home player to cheer in the women's semi-finals - and nobody could have guessed it would be Boisson. The 22-year-old's journey from an unknown player returning from serious injury to a Grand Slam semi-finalist competing with the world's best is extraordinary. Boisson was set to be a wildcard entry last year but had to pull out after tearing an anterior cruciate ligament just a week before the French Open began. But 12 months on, she returned to make a remarkable run that will never be forgotten by French fans. Taking the scalps of third seed Jessica Pegula and sixth seed Mirra Andreeva put her into a first career semi-final on the biggest stage of all. However, Gauff proved to be a step too far. Despite having the backing of a raucous crowd on Court Philippe Chatrier, the energy provided was not enough to compensate for Boisson's lack of quality. Gauff dominated the rallies, breaking Boisson's serve six times before wrapping up victory in one hour and nine minutes. Copyright Â© 2025 BBC.

6/5/2025,Article,News,What we know about Trump's latest travel ban,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/cx271g270v7o,"Donald Trump has signed a ban on travel to the US from 12 countries, citing national security risks. There are also seven additional countries whose nationals will face partial travel restrictions. The US president said the list could be revised if ""material improvements"" were made, while other countries could be added as ""threats emerge around the world"".  It is the second time he has ordered a ban on travel from certain countries. He signed a similar order in 2017 during his first term in office. Trump has signed a proclamation banning travel to the US from nationals of 12 countries: Nationals from these countries will not be allowed to enter the US unless they qualify for an exemption.  There are an additional seven countries whose nationals face partial travel restrictions:  Those under the partial restrictions will not be able to travel to the US with certain visas. The ban takes effect on Monday at 00:01 EDT (04:01 GMT), a cushion that avoids the chaos that unfolded at US airports when a similar measure took effect with virtually no notice eight years ago.  No end date has been provided. The order calls for periodic review. The White House said these ""common sense restrictions"" would ""protect Americans from dangerous foreign actors"". In a video posted to his Truth Social website, Trump said the recent alleged terror attack in Boulder, Colorado ""underscored the extreme dangers"" posed by foreign nationals who had not been ""properly vetted"". Twelve people were injured in Colorado on Sunday when a man attacked a group gathering in support of Israeli hostages, throwing two incendiary devices and using a makeshift flamethrower. The man accused of carrying out the attack has been identified as an Egyptian national, but Egypt is not included on the list of banned countries. Trump has close ties with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who has in the past been described by the US president as his ""favourite dictator"". Only two of the 19 countries are on the US government's State Sponsors of Terrorism list - Iran, which has a full ban, and Cuba, which faces partial travel restrictions. But national security is given as a partial reason for the choices. In the proclamation, Trump said many of the countries listed have a ""historic failure to accept back their removable nationals"" from the US, as well as having ""taken advantage"" of the US by exploiting its visa system. He added that nationals from certain countries also ""pose significant risks"" of overstaying their visas. There are a number of people from affected countries who may still be able to enter the US due to a number of exceptions. The order does not apply to:  In addition, the US Secretary of State may grant exemptions to individuals on a ""case-by-case"" basis, if ""the individual would serve a United States national interest"". Trump's latest order, which is expected to face legal challenges, drew a swift response, at home and abroad.  Chad has retaliated by suspending all visas to US citizens, with President Mahamat Idriss Déby Itno saying the country ""has its dignity and pride"". Somalia promised to work with the US to address any security issues, with ambassador to the US, Dahir Hassan Abdi, saying his country ""values its longstanding relationship"" with the US.  Venezuela's Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello warned that ""being in the United States is a great risk for anyone, not just for Venezuelans"". The African Union, which represents all 55 countries on the continent, called on the US to ""engage in constructive dialogue with the countries concerned"".   It appealed to the US to exercise its right to protect its borders and its citizens' security ""in a manner that is balanced, evidence-based, and reflective of the long-standing partnership between the United States and Africa"". The union said it remained concerned about the ""potential negative impact of such measures"". The UN's human rights chief, Volker Turk, said the ban ""raises concerns from the perspective of international law"" ""The broad and sweeping nature of the new travel ban raises concerns from the perspective of international law,"" Volker Turk said in a statement. That included ""the principle of non-discrimination and of the necessity and proportionality of the measures deployed to meet the security concerns stated"", he told news agency AFP. In the US, Democrats were quick to condemn the move. ""This ban, expanded from Trump's Muslim ban in his first term, will only further isolate us on the world stage,"" Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal wrote on social media. Congressman Don Beyer said Trump had ""betrayed"" the ideals of the founders of the US. Human rights organisation Amnesty International USA described it as ""discriminatory, racist, and downright cruel"", while the US-based Human Rights First called it ""yet another anti-immigrant and punitive action taken"" by the president. But others support the ban. Congressman Clay Higgins of Louisiana said travel to the US was ""a privilege, not a right"".  He claimed on BBC Radio's Today programme that Americans had ""had enough of immigrants coming to our country, violating our laws and committing violence among our people"". Greg Swenson, chairman of Republicans Overseas UK, said the list of countries subject to the travel ban proves the White House is using a ""common sense policy"", but expressed suprise that Egypt had not been included. ""I think what the president has decided was that Egypt, despite having one particular incident from an illegal migrant, might have some policies that are in place which are better than other countries,"" he said. Trump's original ban took place in 2017, during his first White House term, and featured some of the same countries as his latest order, including Iran, Libya and Somalia.   Critics called it a ""Muslim ban"" as the seven countries initially listed were Muslim majority, and it was immediately challenged in courts across the US. The White House revised the policy, ultimately adding two non-Muslim majority countries, North Korea and Venezuela. It was upheld by the US Supreme Court in 2018. Joe Biden, who succeeded Trump as US president, repealed the ban in 2021, calling it ""a stain on our national conscience"". US immigration law expert Christi Jackson said the new ban suggested ""lessons have been learned"" from Trump's first attempt. The latest ban was not being implemented immediately, the restrictions were ""wider in scope"" and it had ""clearly defined"" exemptions, she told the BBC. Professor of law and former US attorney Barbara McQuade said the last travel ban had ""caused chaos at the border"", while this time Trump had given some advance notice. ""The first time around it included lawful permanent residents or Green Card holders, people who had established status in the United States, which courts found to be a violation of the Constitution,"" she told BBC Newshour. ""This time I think there has been more thought given to this,"" she said, adding it was ""very likely"" to be upheld by the Supreme Court.

6/5/2025,Article,News,Three journalists among five killed in Israeli strike on Gaza hospital,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/ckgnp154eeko,"Five people have been killed in an Israeli strike on al-Ahli hospital in Gaza City, according to the Anglican Church, which operates it. The Episcopal Diocese of Jerusalem said three journalists, a father escorting his son to surgery, and another person died on Thursday morning when the hospital's compound was hit. It condemned ""in the strongest possible terms"" the attack, which also injured 30 bystanders, including four hospital staff. The Palestinian Journalists' Syndicate accused Israel of a ""full-fledged war crime"". The Israeli military said it ""precisely struck"" a Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) fighter operating from a command centre inside the hospital's yard. It came the same day as more than 130 global news and press freedom organisations - including the BBC - called for international media to be given immediate access to Gaza and for Palestinian journalists to be given full protection. ""For 20 months, the Israeli authorities have refused to grant journalists outside of Gaza independent access to the Palestinian territory - a situation that is without precedent in modern warfare,"" they wrote in a letter co-ordinated by the Committee to Protect Journalists and Reporters Without Borders. ""Local journalists, those best positioned to tell the truth, face displacement and starvation. To date, nearly 200 journalists have been killed by the Israeli military.  ""Many more have been injured and face constant threats to their lives for doing their jobs: bearing witness. This is a direct attack on press freedom and the right to information."" There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military or government. They have previously denied that Israeli forces have targeted journalists. The Palestinian Journalists' Syndicate said the Israeli strike on al-Ahli hospital's compound directly targeted a media tent. Video footage showed medics and other people rushing to help casualties lying on the ground underneath a tree in a yard and carrying at least four of them into a medical tent. ""The Israeli drone suddenly attacked these colleagues,"" Palestinian journalist Mohammed Ahmed told the news agency Reuters at the scene. ""Three of them [were] martyred, in addition to a number of martyrs among passersby."" ""The Israeli occupation forces are increasing their attacks on us as journalists, trying to prevent us from doing our work,"" he alleged. The journalists' syndicate identified the three dead journalists as Ismail Badah, a cameraman for the PIJ-affiliated Palestine Today TV channel, Soliman Hajaj, a Palestine Today editor, and Samir al-Refai of the Shams News network. Another four journalists were injured, two of whom - Palestine Today correspondent Imad Daloul and Ahmed Qalja, a cameraman for Qatar-based Al-Araby TV - were in a critical condition, it said. The Israeli military said in a statement that it ""precisely struck an Islamic Jihad terrorist who was operating in a command-and-control centre"" in the yard of the hospital. It did not name the target or provide any evidence. The military also accused armed groups of using al-Ahli for ""terrorist activity"" and ""cynically and brutally using the civilian population"" inside - an allegation it has denied. In April, staff at al-Ahli hospital said an Israeli strike destroyed its laboratory and damaged its emergency room. They did not report any direct casualties, but said a child died due to disruption of care. The Israeli military said it hit a Hamas ""command-and-control centre"". Hospitals are specially protected under international humanitarian law. They only lose that protection in certain circumstances, including being used as a base from which to launch an attack, as a weapons depot, or to hide healthy fighters. The Hamas-run Civil Defence agency said Israeli strikes killed at least 37 people across Gaza on Thursday. As well as Gaza City, local media reported deaths in Jabalia and Beit Lahia in the north, and in Khan Younis in the south. Also on Thursday, a controversial US and Israeli-backed aid group working in Gaza said it had reopened two of its distribution centres, a day after closing them for ""renovation"". ""Over the past 24 hours, we have been fully focused on strengthening our distribution sites to ensure safe and more efficient delivery of life-saving aid to the people of Gaza,"" the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation's (GHF) interim executive director John Acree said in a statement. On Wednesday, the GHF announced that it was shutting all of its sites - three out of four of which had been operational - to make them ""as safe as possible"" following a string of deadly incidents nearby. Dozens of Palestinians have been killed in recent days while approaching one of the centres in Rafah on a route that runs through an Israeli military zone. Witnesses have said Israeli forces opened fire at crowds seeking aid. The Israeli military has denied that it fired at civilians within the centre, but it has said that troops fired at ""suspects"" who ignored warning shots and approached them. The GHF has denied that anyone was killed or injured at its centres. The group, which uses US private security contractors, aims to bypass the UN as the main supplier of aid to Palestinians. The UN and other aid groups refuse to co-operate with the new system, saying it contravenes the humanitarian principles of neutrality, impartiality, and independence. They also warn that Gaza's 2.1 million population faces catastrophic levels of hunger after an almost three-month total Israeli blockade that was partially eased two weeks ago. The US and Israel say the GHF's system will prevent aid being stolen by Hamas, which the group denies doing. Separately, the Israeli military said it recovered the bodies of two Israeli-Americans taken back to Gaza as hostages during the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023. Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza in response to the attack, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.

6/5/2025,Article,Sport,'There is no crisis' before Euro 2025 - Wiegman,https://www.bbc.com//sport/football/articles/cp92pjg020yo,"This video can not be played 'I'm really happy where we are right now' England manager Sarina Wiegman says ""there is no crisis"" despite a chaotic 10 days which has seen three high-profile senior players either retire from international football in the build-up to Euro 2025 or withdraw from the tournament. Wiegman named a 23-player squad on Thursday for the tournament in Switzerland, which starts on 2 July, where England are defending champions. She will be without goalkeeper Mary Earps and midfielder Fran Kirby, who have both retired from international football, while defender Millie Bright, who captained the side to the World Cup final in 2023, withdrew from selection to focus on her mental and physical wellbeing. The loss of three players, who have won a combined 217 caps, in such a short time has led to a potentially unsettling period for the Lionesses - and distractions off the pitch dominated discussions at the end of their Women's Nations League campaign this week. ""Yeah, of course, [it] has been hard,"" said Wiegman. ""I think there are three different stories and every story is one on its own.  ""[These are] players who have been with us for a long time, who I have been working with for a long time and so that's hard."" But the Dutchwoman says she is happy with the atmosphere inside the England camp. ""You [the media] see part of it, you are not in our environment all the time and I can ensure that the training sessions were really good last week,"" she said. ""I didn't see anything [to suggest] that there were no connections within the team. I am really happy [with] where we are right now."" Wiegman had to address issues around player's performance-related bonuses in the build-up to the World Cup and there was also heavy scrutiny on her decision to omit former captain Steph Houghton from the Euro 2022 squad in her first year in charge.  ""My experiences before is that there is always noise. We expect noise until we go into the tournament,"" said Wiegman.  ""The difference is, between 2015 and 2017 to now, is that the attention and visibility of the women's game has increased so much. ""It seems like there is more noise but there's just more journalists here. Which is right. It shows what we are doing. We have to deal with it and move on. Which we have."" Sarina Wiegman is aiming to win a third successive Euros title as manager Wiegman said she was feeling ""good"" despite it being a week full of difficult decisions and conversations. Kirby's retirement followed Wiegman's decision not to include her in the Euros squad, while goalkeeper Earps was unhappy at her position as number two.  Wiegman said it is ""part of the job"" to endure those experiences but she can ""move forward"" to the Euros now. ""Yes, those hard conversations are not nice. I know what players do and how hard they work to make the squad. It's hard to give disappointing messages,"" she added.  ""At the same time, I also had very nice messages to give so that gives me more energy. ""After I have conversations with players, I always think, 'OK, what went well?' For me, it is really important that I am honest, that I treat people in the right way. ""Sometimes, you have very good news and, sometimes, you don't have good news - and I don't go around the bush with that.  ""I just give that message, then I can't always control how people respond to that. I just hope that they have the clarity to move on."" Wiegman also said part of the growth of women's football, and the success of the Lionesses, has added increased demands on her players. Bright's withdrawal has been a blow for England as Wiegman said the Chelsea captain would have been selected had she not ruled herself out. Asked when she was made aware of Bright's decision, she said: ""In the last couple of days I found out. It was sad and disappointing.  ""It's not nice when you don't feel well physically and mentally and I just hope she feels better soon.  ""England's profile is growing. That's life changing and very exciting but at the same time players are not robots. They have to deal with these things too.  ""That's also why we're trying to support them as well as possible on and off the pitch. Hopefully many players stay fit and healthy."" Head here to get involved Copyright Â© 2025 BBC.

6/5/2025,Article,News,US-Boeing deal over crashes 'repugnant' - lawyer for victims' families,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/c5y57p8xnp5o,"A lawyer for 16 families of the victims of a fatal Boeing 737 Max crash, has told the BBC that a deal between the aviation giant and the US Justice Department (DOJ) is ""morally repugnant"". The firm said it agreed to pay $1.1bn (£811.5m) to avoid prosecution over two crashes that killed 346 people, in a filing on Wednesday. Sanjiv Singh, counsel for family members of some of the victims of a 2018 crash in Indonesia, says the deal allows the firm to ""sidestep true criminal accountability"". Boeing has previously said: ""We are deeply sorry for their losses, and remain committed to honouring their loved ones' memories by pressing forward with the broad and deep changes to our company"". The deal includes the company paying $444.5m to families of crash victims. It will also put $455m towards improving its compliance, safety and quality programmes. Under the deal, Boeing also agreed to pay a criminal penalty of $487.2m, although half of that was already paid in 2021. ""Boeing is committed to complying with its obligations under this resolution, which include a substantial additional fine and commitments to further institutional improvements and investments,"" said a company spokesperson.  If the deal is approved by a federal judge the plane maker will avoid a criminal fraud trial. ""The [DOJ] agreed that it will not further criminally prosecute the company"", said Boeing in a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing. The BBC has contacted the DOJ to request further comment on the agreement. Two 737 Max aircraft crashed in separate but almost identical accidents that killed 346 people. In October 2018, all 189 people on a Lion Air flight died after the aircraft crashed into the Java Sea 13 minutes after take-off from Jakarta, Indonesia. In March 2019, an Ethiopian Airlines flight crashed six minutes after take-off from the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa. All 157 people on-board were killed. Both crashes were linked to faulty flight control systems. In 2021, Boeing agreed to settle US fraud charges and admitted deception over hiding information from safety officials about the design of its 737 Max planes. Relatives of the victims will have the chance to appeal this latest deal when it is considered by a federal judge. Mr Singh says the latest agreement has provoked ""visceral outrage"" from his clients and believes the current payout is insufficient. ""If you look at that $1.1bn, it's actually like Boeing paying $10 to escape criminal liability. It's as if they got a misdemeanour ticket or a parking ticket."" Copyright 2025 BBC.

6/5/2025,Article,News,Medicines watchdog to open 'digital hub' in city,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/ce8148d4k5jo,"The UK's drug safety watchdog is to open a new ""digital hub"" in West Yorkshire.  The site, to be located in Leeds city centre, would focus on digital delivery, software development and data science, according to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). The MHRA regulates new medicines, healthcare products and healthcare technologies for patients to use. Lawrence Tallon, MHRA chief executive, said opening the new site in the city was aimed at ""strengthening our ability to collaborate with partners across the north of England"". There had been a ""huge growth"" in healthcare technologies driven by changes in software and AI which were going to revolutionise the way the NHS worked, and the new Leeds hub would help regulate those technologies, Mr Tallon said. Leeds was chosen for the new hub as it was home to over 44,000  tech professionals and about 11,000 students studying tech-related subjects, according to the MHRA. The hub, in Wellington Place, would also serve as a base for the digital operations of NHS England, with increasing investment from major tech companies, an MHRA spokesperson said. About 30 permanent, highly-skilled roles would initially be recruited to work at the new centre in the city, they added. Wes Streeting, secretary of state for health and social care, said: ""There is a global tech revolution in healthcare unfolding, and Yorkshire will help our country lead it.  ""This isn't just about creating new jobs across the region, it's also about bolstering a city that's already leading the way in digital health."" Mr Tallon said that by establishing an MHRA digital hub in Leeds, ""we're strengthening our ability to collaborate with partners across the north of England – bringing regulatory expertise closer to the people, organisations and innovations we serve"". Meanwhile, he said Leeds was ""buzzing, thriving, an exciting place"". ""We are really excited about create new jobs within our organisation right in the heart of Leeds,"" Mr Tallon added. Fiona Venner, Leeds City Council's executive member for equality, health and wellbeing, said the MHRA's announcement of the plan for a digital hub was ""welcome"". ""Leeds is already a centre for digital health and innovation and this rapidly growing market contributes significantly to the economy,"" she said. ""The hub will support the creation of jobs and provide career opportunities for local graduates and professionals.""

6/5/2025,Article,News,Women warned weight-loss jabs may affect the pill,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/cn0gp2pl7zwo,"Women using weight-loss jabs have been warned by the UK's medicines regulator that they must use effective contraception. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) says it is not known whether taking the medicines, such as Wegovy and Mounjaro, could harm an unborn baby. It also warns that weight-loss jabs may make the contraceptive pill less likely to work in those who are overweight or obese. There are concerns that the growing popularity of 'skinny jabs' means many women aren't using the drugs safely or getting the right advice. It's thought the contraceptive pill may not be absorbed properly due to common side-effects of the jabs such as vomiting and diarrhoea, and because they slow the emptying of the stomach.  The MHRA says women should use contraception while taking GLP-1 medicines and for a certain period afterwards before trying to become pregnant - two months for Wegovy and Ozempic, and one month for Mounjaro. It also advises that those using Mounjaro and taking an oral contraceptive should also use a condom for four weeks after starting the drug, or switch to another method such as the coil or implant.  Advice on contraception already appears in patient information leaflets that come with the medicines, but the MHRA has now issued its own guidance. The drugs safety body says weight-loss injections must not be taken: Women should be told this information when they starting taking the jabs, but there are fears the message is not getting through. Natasha Major, 26, started using Mounjaro to lose weight before planning to try for her third baby in a few years' time, but was shocked six weeks later to find she was pregnant. She was taking the contraceptive pill at the time. ""I have polycystic ovaries as well, so I can't get pregnant easily or quickly. So it was an even bigger shock that I had, which didn't make any sense to me,"" she says. She then worried she could be harming the baby or it would not develop properly. Natasha rang her GP for advice and was told to stop taking it. ""We're over the initial shock now and really happy, just wasn't expected,"" she says.  ""The last injection I took, I found out about the pregnancy three hours later and haven't taken it since then. ""I've had an early scan to make sure the pregnancy was viable and okay - baby had a little heartbeat and everything looks good,"" Natasha says.  The MHRA, as well as doctors and pharmacists, are worried that popular GLP-1 medicines, known as Wegovy, Mounjaro, Saxenda, Victoza and Ozempic, are not being used safely. These prescription medicines, which are licensed to treat obesity (and Ozempic for type 2 diabetes), make people feel full by mimicking a hormone released after eating. Mounjaro also acts on another hormone linked to appetite and blood sugar control. They are only available on the NHS to people with a very high BMI, but can also be bought privately from high street and online chemists. Such is the demand for the jabs, they are also being sold illegally on social media and from beauty salons, without any medical advice or prescription, as a quick fix to lose weight.  The MHRA advises people to have a conversation with their prescriber about the risks and benefits of taking them, and understand the potential side-effects by talking to a doctor or pharmacist. It has acted now because it has received around 40 reports relating to pregnancy made to its Yellow Card scheme, where the public can report suspected side-effects of medicines. Some of these have been unintended pregnancies. Dr Alison Cave, chief safety officer at the MHRA, said there was evidence from animal studies ""that these medicines may harm the unborn baby"". ""But we don't know whether we have the same effects in humans, so much more data is needed to determine that."" Women of child-bearing age are usually not included in clinical trials, which is why there is a lack of safety information for them. ""If you are taking this medicine and you are pregnant, you should talk to your doctor about stopping the medicine as soon as possible,"" Dr Cave said. Sukhi Basra, vice-chairwoman of the National Pharmacy Association, said women should visit their pharmacist for advice if they are confused about when to stop using the drugs, and always buy them from an official pharmacy. Dr Bassel Wattar, pregnancy expert and consultant at Epsom and St Helier University Hospitals, said the implant or the intrauterine coil offered ""more robust contraception"" than the oral combined contraceptive pill while taking the injections. Losing a lot of weight can sometimes help some women restore natural ovulation and boost their chances of becoming pregnant, but he said this should be planned under the care of specialist doctors ""to ensure a pregnancy can be planned safely after a washout period off these drugs"". BPAS, the British Pregnancy Advisory Service, says women in the UK ""face significant challenges"" when trying to access their contraceptive method of choice. A lack of appointments, long waiting lists and high costs are just some of the barriers they face, BPAS said, as it called for a better plan for providing the choice women need.

6/5/2025,Article,News,"Charli XCX, Snow Patrol and Stereophonics among Belsonic headline acts",https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/cd7gp2je5ewo,"More than 100,000 music lovers are expected to gather at Belfast's Ormeau Park in the next few weeks for Belsonic.  The annual outdoor music festival kicks off on Thursday night and runs until the end of the month.  The first headliners are Welsh band Stereophonics.  ""Hopefully it doesn't rain. We'll be all right.... we've got our raincoats,"" lead singer Kelly Jones told BBC Radio Ulster's Vinny & Cate show. Jones said a recent world tour proves they are not a band that relies on ""being a phase"" from the 1990s and that their music ""is still appealing to new audiences"".  ""There are kids in the front row,"" he added.   Snow Patrol, Alanis Morissette, Charli XCX, the DJ BLK and Justin Timberlake are among a host of other big names set to take to the stage this year. Lush! Classical, featuring the Ulster Orchestra, are headlining on Saturday while Catfish and the Bottlemen are performing the following Saturday (15 June).  Justin Timberlake will perform on 26 June, supported by Jess Glynne. For dance music fans, the Boiler Room will see Dutch DJ and producer Chris Stussy team up with KETTAMA, a DJ and producer from Galway, on 28 June.  Alanis Morissette will wrap up the festival on 30 June.  Festival director Alan Simms said when deciding on the acts they aim for ""a broad range of music that appeals to as broad a range of people as possible"".  He said personally he was looking forward to seeing Snow Patrol as they had been trying to get them for many years but for ""diaries and for other reasons it hasn't panned out"" in the past.   The gates at Ormeau Park will open at 18:00 BST and close at 21:45 BST. Belsonic says the curfew is usually about 23:00 BST but times will be posted on social media on the day of the event. Translink says while there will be no special shuttle buses in Belfast for the gigs, scheduled Metro bus services connect with Ormeau Park. If you are travelling from the north west, special Goldliner coach services are operating from and to Foyle Street Buscentre in Londonderry for all of the events, with the exception of the Madness concert.  There will also be additional rail services running throughout Belsonic. Further information is available here.  Ormeau Embankment is set to be closed from Ravenhill Road to Ormeau Road from 16:00 BST on the dates of the gigs. It will remain closed for a period after each concert, so the public is asked to be aware of this if arranging a safe collection location. Details about accessibility parking and facilities during Belsonic are available here. The Lush Classical, BLK and Boiler Room gigs are strictly over 16s only and Belsonic says valid ID will be required. Under 16s can attend all the other performances, but will require a parent or guardian who is also a ticket holder to accompany them.  There are also some age restrictions on who can enter the front standing section.  Copyright 2025 BBC.

6/5/2025,Article,News,200-year-old condom 'in mint condition' says museum,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/c1de271qg4yo,"An almost 200-year-old condom - in ""mint condition"" - has just gone on display at an exhibition at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. It is thought to be made of a sheep's appendix and features an explicit print representing a nun and three clergymen. The rare artefact dates back to 1830 and was purchased by the museum at an auction last year. The condom is part of an exhibition on 19th Century prostitution and sexuality. Prints, drawings and photographs also form part of the display. Rijksmuseum curator Joyce Zelen told the BBC when she and her colleague first spotted the condom at auction they ""were laughing"".  Ms Zelen said ""no-one else noticed it"" and they were the only ones who bid on it. After obtaining the item, they inspected it with UV light and ascertained that it had not been used.  ""It's in mint condition,"" said Ms Zelen.  Since it was put on display the museum has been packed with people - young and old - and the ""response has been amazing"", she added. Ms Zelen explained the condom is believed to have been a ""luxury souvenir"" from a fancy brothel in France, and that only two such objects are known to have survived to the present day. The museum said the unusual item ""embodies both the lighter and darker sides of sexual health, in an era when the quest for sensual pleasure was fraught with fears of unwanted pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases – especially syphilis"". The explicit print on this specific object shows the nun sitting in front of the three men with her dress up and her legs apart pointing her finger at the clergymen, all of whom are standing in front of her holding up their habits. The condom also bears the inscription ""Voilà mon choix"", meaning ""There is my choice"". The museum noted the print is thus to be considered as a ""parody of both celibacy and the Judgement of Paris from Greek mythology"", the latter being the mythological story of a Trojan Prince named Paris who had to decide who was the fairest goddess among Aphrodite, Hera and Athena. The Dutch museum notes that their Print Room collection holds some 750,000 prints, drawings and photographs but that this is the first example in the collection of a print on a condom. ""As far as we can tell we are the only art museum with a printed condom,"" said Ms Zelen.  She said her institution was ""open to loan"" the artefact out to other museums, but noted that the condom was very delicate. It will be on display until the end of November. Copyright 2025 BBC.

6/5/2025,Article,Travel,Jimmy Choo's well-heeled guide to Kuala Lumpur,https://www.bbc.com//travel/article/20250602-jimmy-choos-guide-to-kuala-lumpur,"His shoes ignited a worldwide sartorial revolution, but he hangs his hat in KL. Here are his top hometown experiences, from enjoying street food to designing your own bespoke suit. Home to the Petronas Twin towers and one of the world's most recognisable skylines, the Malaysian capital has evolved over the last four decades from a modest metropolis known for its charming colonial architecture to a thriving, ultra-modern city. Born in Penang, Jimmy Choo grew up in a family of shoemakers and crafted his first pair aged 11. He studied footwear design in London and shot to fame in the 1990s when he founded his eponymous brand and Princess Diana became a loyal client. In 2021, Choo opened the Jimmy Choo Academy fashion school in Mayfair to nurture the next generation of design talents. The academy's graduate exposition show takes place on 9 June 2025. (Credit: Tet Leon Lee) ""Many years ago, when I came to Kuala Lumpur for the first time, it wasn't as modern,"" says legendary shoe designer Jimmy Choo, who hails from Penang, an island on Malaysia's north-western coast. ""It has changed a lot. There are now lots of high-rise apartments and hotels and it's a lot more multicultural.""  The perennially fashionable Choo, who splits his time between London and Kuala Lumpur where he owns a penthouse apartment a stone's throw from the Petronas Towers in the upmarket KLCC (Kuala Lumpur City Centre) neighbourhood, says the city has also become a major destination for fashion fans on the hunt for high-end bargains. ""A lot of people come here to shop because we have a lot of designer shops and the prices are not too high,"" he says. ""Whether you want to buy shoes, bags, accessories – you can get them all in KL."" If your budget won't stretch to luxury labels, Choo recommends seeking out homegrown talents. ""Malaysia has a lot of local designers who have been very well trained overseas,"" he says. ""They go to study fashion in places like the UK or Australia, then when they've finished their studies, they often come back to their own country to promote their designs."" Beyond retail therapy, the cosmopolitan city is famous for mouthwatering street food from all corners of Asia and plentiful people-watching opportunities at fancy rooftop bars, where you can show off your designer finery while sipping an ice-cold cocktail.  Here are Choo's favourite places for shopping, dining and drinking in the incredible views of Kuala Lumpur. Founded in 1974 by designer Robert Loh, Lord's Tailor specialises in custom suits for men and women and is beloved by many of Malaysia's most stylish celebrities. Kuala Lumpur benefits from balmy temperatures year-round, with monsoon season from November to March. ""I think May to October is the best time to come for a holiday,"" Choo says. ""During rainy season, the weather can be very difficult to predict."" ""It was recently the 50th anniversary of the designer Robert, who learned tailoring and design in London,"" says Choo, a loyal customer since the 1990s. ""Whenever I travel to different parts of the world, they will design all my outfits – daywear and evening wear.""  Providing exceptional sartorial skills at a fraction of the Savile Row price, the atelier's team of tailors and seamstresses can whip up a bespoke or made-to-measure suit in a matter of days.  ""They have their own factory, and all the staff have been very well trained,"" Choo says. ""If you go on a Monday for the measurements, they will have everything ready by Wednesday or Thursday to bring home."" How much will a Lord's Tailor suit set you back? ""It depends on the fabric you choose,"" says Choo. ""Prices start at around 3,000 ringgit (around £515) for a jacket and trousers with one shirt, going up to 10,000 ringgit (around £1,750) if you choose Italian fabric."" Website: www.lordstailor.com.my Address: F18 & F19, 1st floor, Bangsar Shopping Centre, 285 Jalan Maarof Phone: +6 017 670 7217 Instagram: @lordstailor/ A fashionista's paradise, glitzy Pavilion shopping centre is where you'll find the flagship stores of luxury brands such as Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Dior and Hermès alongside high street favourites like Zara and COS. ""Pavilion has got a lot of different brands so there's something to suit every budget,"" Choo says. ""For example, if you want to spend £30 on a shirt or trousers, or if you want to spend thousands and thousands on those higher-level designers."" To sample Malaysian style, try cool handbag brand Sembonia, trendy plus-size fashion pioneer Ms. Read, or Fipper, which sells rubber flip-flops in a vast array of colours. And if you've exhausted your options at Pavilion, pop over the road to another of Choo's favourite retail hotspots, The Starhill, a luxurious shopping centre home to the world's biggest watch gallery. Website: www.pavilion-kl.com Address: 168 Jalan Bukit Bintang Phone: +6 032 118 8833 Showcasing Malaysian handicraft techniques, the Kuala Lumpur Craft Complex is a series of buildings in the Terengganu style with gabled roofs and intricate wood carvings and features a museum where visitors can see how traditional textiles are woven and dyed. ""Batik is hand-painted and uses wax to create the designs,"" Choo explains. ""Songket comes in lots of different colours and has the gold and silver thread woven through. It's quite expensive because it takes some time to weave by hand."" Typically worn on formal occasions, a songket outfit usually comprises a baju kurung long-sleeved shirt, a sarong or trousers, a sampin decorative scarf around the waist and a songkok cap for men. ""Usually when I'm attending my birthday event I wear songket because one of my students designs with songket material,"" Choo says. ""It's common at Malaysian weddings as well. When government people go to functions, they usually wear batik."" Travellers can purchase songket and batik fabric as well as readymade garments and accessories in the Karyaneka Boutique at the Kuala Lumpur Craft Complex. Website: www.kraftangan.gov.my Address: Section 63, Jalan Conlay Phone: +6 032 162 7459 Instagram: @kraftanganmalaysia To refuel after all that shopping, cheap – and delicious – eats are just a five-minute taxi ride from the city's major shopping centres to Chinatown; namely, Petaling Street Market. When packing for a trip to Kuala Lumpur, be sure to include some light layers, Choo advises. ""Outside, it's humid and hot, so you can wear a T-shirt and shorts, but when you go into a shopping mall, cafe or restaurant, it's all air conditioned, so you need something to wear on top. For some reason, cinemas are always very cold, you almost need a winter jacket!"" Reflecting Kuala Lumpur's history as a trading hub since the 6th Century, the market features a blend of Malay, Indian, and Chinese cuisine with hints of Arab, Thai and Portuguese flavours to boot. Choo lists his favourite Petaling Street eats: ""I love char kway teow [stir-fried flat noodles], Hainanese chicken with rice, roti canai [flaky Malaysian flatbread], nasi lemak [rice cooked in coconut milk and pandan leaves served with chilli paste, anchovies and boiled egg], and nasi kandar, which is chicken with spicy curry sauce."" For dessert, he suggests sniffing out a helping of durian, the divisive yellow-fleshed fruit with a spiky exterior and a distinctive aroma. ""Some people like it, some don't,"" says Choo. ""They say it smells like cheese or something like that. But you cannot bring it back to the hotel, they won't allow it because it smells so strong!"" Address: Jalan Petaling, City Centre While many of Kuala Lumpur's rooftop bars look down on the city, WET Deck at the W Hotel is situated on the 12th floor, meaning the neighbouring Petronas Twin Towers provide a dramatic and glittering backdrop when night falls.  ""If I want to have a drink and some good western or Malay food, I normally go to W Hotel bar,"" Choo says. ""You can sit by the swimming pool and see the Twin Towers right in front of you. It's a place you can relax and take some nice pictures. You can see the whole of KL.""  Choo's tipple of choice is a nod to his international lifestyle. ""People in Malaysia like to drink cognac and whisky,"" he says. ""But my favourite drink is actually a very English one; I love a lager and lime.""  A minimum spend of 500 ringgit (around £90) per table is required at WET Deck on Friday and Saturday nights, so choose a weeknight if you're looking for a more affordable option.

With a jogging track, children's playground and wading pool, it's great for families, or anyone who wants a breather and a shady spot to escape the heat.  ""You can have a beautiful morning walk in the park or go for a run, you can see water features and birds during the day,"" says Choo. ""And at night it's very romantic. You often see couples walking around the lake."" Open from 10:00 to 22:00, with the main entrance on Jalan Ampang, the park also offers a brilliant vantage point to grab some snaps as the sun sets and the skyscrapers light up.

6/5/2025,Article,Travel,The women saving Japan's vanishing cuisine,https://www.bbc.com//travel/article/20250530-the-women-saving-japans-vanishing-cuisine,"For 450 years, the little-known Ryukyu Kingdom thrived in what is now Japan. Now, after nearly vanishing, its unique fusion cuisine is being revived. ""You can learn a lot about a person by looking at their tongue,"" Yukie Miyaguni tells me in the kitchen-classroom of her second-storey apartment in Uruma, a city on the Japanese island of Okinawa. I've taken a few cooking classes over the years, but this is the first time anyone's ever asked to examine my tongue. With my mouth agape, Miyaguni – a Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) practitioner and Ryukyuan chef – gives my tongue a long look before drawing its likeness on a whiteboard and offering a prescription: ""More cacao at night, honey in the morning and more butter,"" she concludes, noting it will help improve my blood circulation and dry skin.  I didn't come to Okinawa for a diagnosis per se, but in many ways, it was my taste buds that led me to Miyaguni's kitchen. I had been hoping to learn more about the island's elusive and indigenous Ryukyuan cuisine, which can be traced back to the 12th Century when the Ryukyu Islands began trading with other East Asian states. The Ryukyu Islands stretch more than 1,100km, from the southern tip of Kyushu to north-eastern Taiwan. From 1429-1879, the archipelago flourished as a semi-autonomous state known as the Ryukyu Kingdom and was an important cross-section of maritime trade during its 450-year history. Over time, the islands developed a distinctive cultural and culinary identity that blended endemic ingredients like bitter melon, shikuwasa (a lime-like citrus fruit), beni-imo (purple sweet potatoes) and mozuku seaweed with non-native cooking techniques and ingredients. Siamese (modern-day Thai) traders brought indica rice; the Chinese introduced a variety of herbs, teas and pork; and Korean merchants taught residents how to pickle and ferment seafood and vegetables. BBC.com's World's Table ""smashes the kitchen ceiling"" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future. As Miyaguni explained, when the Kingdom's royal family welcomed visiting envoys and magistrates, they did so with a refined style of cooking and customs called ""court cuisine"" (Ukwanshin Ryori), in which portions of hana-ika (sliced squid), minudaru (steamed pork in seasame sauce), gunbomachi (burdock root wrapped in pork) and more were presented in a Ryukyuan lacquerware called a tundabun. When Japan annexed and renamed the island chain Okinawa in 1879, court cuisine spread from the upper echelons of Ryukyuan society to the countryside. Everyday households continued to pass down home-cooked recipes from the islands' more relaxed ""folk cuisine"" as well. But when US forces occupied Okinawa for several decades after World War Two, a mixture of American fast food influence, a rapid assimilation to Japanese culture, food shortages and economic hardships led to the near disappearance of the islands' ancient fusion food culture. Now, thanks to a growing contingent of women like Miyaguni, a resurgence of Ryukyuan cuisine is quietly underway. ""This was the food of our ancestors,"" Miyaguni says, slicing into a pimply green bitter gourd called goya and tossing it into a small mixing bowl along with tofu, eggs and pork to make a traditional style of stir fry called champaru. Meaning ""to mix together"", champaru dishes are often considered the spirit of Okinawa because they reflect the islands' diverse influences. ""By cooking this way,"" Miyaguni continued, ""we honour their [memories] and keep this ancient culture alive."" As with traditional Japanese cuisine on the mainland, Ryukyuan food is rooted in locally sourced and seasonal ingredients. Dishes and ingredients like goya champaru, jimami (peanut) tofu, slow-boiled agu (pork) and umibudo (sea grapes) served in tundabun or Okinawan pottery called yachimun are integral to keeping the traditions of Ryukyuan court cuisine and folk cuisine alive. ""Ryukyuan cuisine is not colourful, so using these plates and lacquerware helped make the food look more vivid,"" Miyaguni explained, pointing to the fire engine-red tundabuncontaining each dish on the table. After we finished kneading the dough for chinsuko (a traditional Okinawan shortbread made of lard, flour and sugar) and placed it in the oven, we sat down to enjoy the fruits of our labour. As I savoured delicate bites of buttery soft peanut tofu, slices of black sesame-coated pork loin and mung bean rice balls wrapped in banana leaves, Miyaguni explained the health benefits of Ryukyuan food. She said ingredients like bitter melon and purple sweet potatoes are high in antioxidants and help lower blood sugar and aid digestion, while awamori, a locally distilled spirit, can aid in gut health. Miyaguni's interest in preserving Ryukyuan food culture is rooted in the Chinese philosophy of food as medicine. After retiring as a nutritionist at a hospital in Okinawa in 2008, Miyaguni encountered TCM and began to learn about its ""deep connection"" to Ryukyuan cuisine. For the last 10 years, Miyaguni has been teaching locals and visitors about the health components of Ryukyuan cuisine from her home. In 2018, she was selected as a representative of Ryukyuan cuisine by the Okinawa Prefectural Governor. ""Until now, Okinawa has been the pride of the world as the island of longevity. However, now the health of the people is deteriorating,"" Miyaguni said. Miyaguni explained that even after the islands were annexed, Ryukyuan folk cuisine was still governed by the Chinese philosophy of ishoku dogen, which emphasises the importance of using high-quality, seasonally available ingredients. Homemade tofu, mugwort soup, purple potato and bitter melon remained staples of folk cuisine, along with the Confucian belief of using all parts of the pig. ""Everything but the oink,"" Miyaguni said. Today, Miyaguni still keeps a book in her kitchen called Gozen Honzō (Edible Plants of Ryukyu), which was written by a chief physician to the king of the Ryukyuan Kingdom. ""Gozen Honzō… explains the types of and used of edible plants, animals and many other foods and a number of sections describe methods of preparing them,"" Miyaguni said. ""We've lost the Ryukyuan language because it isn't taught, but understanding how our ancestors cooked, and teaching these traditions is how we will continue to protect the Ryukyuan culture for future generations,"" she added. While Miyaguni's interest in preserving Ryukyuan cuisine stems from her medicinal background, Kazumi Kayo, a Ryukyuan cooking instructor and food culture ambassador for the Okinawa Prefecture, says her interest in reviving these culinary traditions goes back to her mother. ""When I was young, I was not interested in Ryukyuan cuisine,"" Kayo said. ""However, the memory of the taste that my mother made for me since I was a child came back to me, and I wanted to maintain a cooking method that brought out the taste of these simple ingredients, so I specialised in cooking, obtained a qualification and started a cooking class.""  But Kayo is aware that the region's famous longevity – which many believe is inextricably linked to its diet – is increasingly in peril.  ""For a long time, Okinawa prefecture has maintained the world's longest life expectancy, but with the Westernisation of food, that ranking has dropped, and now the number of people suffering from lifestyle-related diseases is increasing, which is a problem for the prefecture,"" Kayo said.  In 2016, Okinawa's prefectural government developed a programme called Ryukyuan Cuisine Masters to help preserve Ryukyuan food while also addressing rising health concerns. ""About five years ago, we strengthened training for chefs in the food and beverage industry and nutrition associations, provided them with qualifications and started activities to pass on and popularise Ryukyuan cuisine, including traditional cooking methods,"" Kayo added. ""I think the residents of the prefecture will realise the goodness of Ryukyuan cuisine again.""  Now in her 18th year as a Ryukyuan cooking instructor, Kayo runs the Yonner Food Cooking Studio, whose classes start by taking locals and visitors to Makishi Public Market in downtown Naha. ""Yonnerfood' means 'slow food' in Okinawan dialect, and by having a leisurely chat while shopping and taking a cooking class, I hope to help people learn about Okinawa's food culture and develop a love for Okinawa,"" Kayo said.  More like this: • Japan's spectacular bike ride through six remote islands • The eight Asian sauces to keep in your pantry • Japan's 97-year-old cherry blossom guardian In 2019, in an effort to further prevent the decline of Ryukyuan cuisine, the non-profit Ryukyu Cuisine Preservation Association was established to safeguard and promote the culinary heritage of the Ryukyu Kingdom. The same year, ""The Unbroken Legacy of the Ryukyu Kingdom"" and its unique food culture was registered as a national heritage of Japan. In addition to educational cooking classes like Miyaguni's and Kayo's, a handful of Ryukyuan restaurants and food tours have also cropped up across the islands.  Local tour guide Junko Yokoo's Blue Zone Okinawa Home Cooking Tour takes guests to the home of Hiromi Nerome, another certified Ryukyuan cuisine specialist and chef whose own cooking class is based out of her home in the seaside village of Nakijin. ""I started offering this tour in 2022 in response to tourists' interest in Okinawa's 'longevity' cuisine,"" Yokoo tells me. ""Locally grown vegetables like bitter melon and purple sweet potato are quite different from mainland Japan, so people are curious to taste them and learn about what makes Okinawan food so healthy."" In 2024, Suitenrou opened in downtown Naha and offers a mix of Ryukyuan folk and court cuisine along with traditional music and dancing. For a more formal court cuisine-inspired affair, Kuninda also in downtown Naha serves classic dishes like stewed pork cubes in white miso and sea grapes topped with freshly grated wasabi. But if you ask Miyaguni or Kayo, they will tell you that the key to preserving Ryukyuan food culture starts in the kitchen and is best learned through hands-on experience. ""I think that if we can spread the word and attract attention outside the prefecture and abroad, the people of the prefecture will once again realise the goodness of Ryukyuan cuisine,"" Kayo said. ""If Ryukyuan cuisine disappears, we will lose the identity of Okinawa, so we must preserve it.""  -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.  For more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.

6/5/2025,Article,News,Giant 1970s cheese plant rehomed at indoor zoo,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/c7715djgr82o,"A giant cheese plant which has been growing at a Leeds medical school since the 1970s has been rehomed at a nearby indoor zoo. The monster Monstera - named Audrey after the blood-sucking antagonist of the 1986 film Little Shop of Horrors - had lived in the stairwell of Old Medical School at Leeds General Infirmary. Due to building work at the site, the 3m (10ft) tall plant has now been rehoused at nearby Tropical World in Roundhay, which boasts the largest collection of tropical plants outside Kew Gardens. Visitor attraction manager Jo Langton said moving Audrey had been a ""massive challenge"" but they were ""determined to do everything we could to rescue her"". Audrey needed to be trimmed back before she was able to be moved, but has now been replanted in the Rainforest Canopy area. Once established, the NHS plans to install a plaque to explain her history. Ms Langton said: ""She's going to need a lot of TLC and it's still early days, but fortunately we do have an established cheese plant here already which grows extremely well, so we all have our fingers crossed that she'll adapt to her new surroundings. ""We also know that Audrey has quite a following on social media, so we're happy to share that she's still around in Leeds and would love visitors to come along and see her settling in."" Native to central and south America, monstera can grow up to a height of 20m (66ft) in the wild, climbing trees by using a network of aerial roots which hooks over branches. Mohammed Rafique, Leeds City Council's executive member for climate, energy, environment and green space, said: ""It's wonderful that we've been able to give Audrey a new home so her story can continue, and we can preserve a little bit of Leeds history for visitors so enjoy too.""

6/6/2025,Article,News,Russia launches 'massive' strikes days after Ukrainian drone attack,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/cvg7zy1jq7no,"Russia launched large-scale drone and missile strikes on Ukraine's capital and other parts of the country early on Friday, officials said.  At least three people were killed and 49 injured in the strikes, according to Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky. The aerial raids targeted Kyiv, as well as the city of Lutsk and the Ternopil region in the north-west of the country. Russia's defence ministry said the strikes were in response to ""terrorist acts by the Kyiv regime"", adding that it had targeted military sites. The ministry said its armed forces ""overnight launched a massive strike with high-precision long-range air, sea and ground-based weapons, as well as attack drones"". The attack came after Russian President Vladimir Putin warned US President Donald Trump he would respond to Ukraine's recent strikes on Russian airbases.  In a post on X on Friday, Zelensky said that ""now is exactly the moment when America, Europe, and everyone around the world can stop this war together by pressuring Russia"". He made a thinly veiled reference to Trump's apparent unwillingness to put pressure on Russia. ""If someone is not applying pressure and is giving the war more time to take lives – that is complicity and accountability,"" Zelensky wrote. ""We must act decisively."" Zelensky said that ""as of now"", three deaths had been confirmed in the strikes - all employees of Ukraine's state emergency services. He said the attack used more than 400 drones and more than 40 missiles, and the number of people injured ""may increase"". In an earlier statement, Kyiv's Mayor Vitali Klitschko said four people had been killed in the country's capital. Air raid alerts were in place in Kyiv, where a residential building was hit, and the city's train system was disrupted after shelling damaged metro tracks. Tens of thousands of civilians in the capital spent a restless few hours in underground shelters. From the centre of the city, prolonged bursts of machine gun fire could be heard as air defences on the outskirts attempted to bring down scores of drones aimed at Kyiv.  From time to time, the distinctive buzz of drones overhead could also be heard. Bright flashes of light, sometimes reflected on nearby buildings, would be followed, five or ten seconds later, by thunderous explosions. Authorities say the attacks included 38 cruise missiles, which is the kind Ukraine targeted in Sunday's so-called ""Spider's Web"" operation, suggesting this attack could be a message from the Kremlin. The cities of Kharkiv, Sumy and Luhansk were also under air raid alerts. Elsewhere, Ternopil's military chief Vyacheslav Negoda said Friday's strike was the ""most massive air attack on our region to date"". Mayor of Ternopil, Igor Polishchuk, said five people were wounded in the attack and there was damage to homes, schools and a government facility. In Lutsk, five people were injured in an attack using 15 drones and six missiles, according to mayor Ihor Polishchuk.  Meanwhile, the Russian defence ministry said its air defences shot down 174 Ukrainian drones overnight in parts of Russia and occupied Crimea.  The ministry said Neptune anti-ship cruise missiles were also intercepted over the Black Sea.  Russia's latest attack on Ukraine comes days after Kyiv launched its biggest long-range drone strike on at least 40 Russian warplanes at four military bases. Zelensky said 117 drones were used in the Spider's Web operation by the SBU security service, striking ""34% of [Russia's] strategic cruise missile carriers"". Earlier this month, direct peace talks between Russia and Ukraine took place in Istanbul, but ended without a major breakthrough.  Ukrainian negotiators said Russia rejected an ""unconditional ceasefire"" - a key demand of Kyiv and its Western allies including the US. The Russian team said they had proposed a two-or three-day truce ""in certain areas"" of the vast front line, but gave no further details. Trump said Putin vowed to ""very strongly"" respond to Ukraine's recent attack on Russian airbases, during a phone call that lasted more than an hour on Wednesday.  Moscow had previously said that military options were ""on the table"" for its response to Ukraine's attack. Last week, Trump appeared to set a two-week deadline for Putin, threatening to change how the US is responding to Russia if he believed Putin was still ""tapping"" him along on peace efforts in Ukraine.

6/6/2025,Article,News,How bitter feud escalated - and what happens next,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/c3wd2215q08o,"What happens when the richest person and the most powerful politician have a knock-down, drag-out fight? The world is finding out – and it's not a pretty picture. Donald Trump and Elon Musk have two of the biggest megaphones, and they have now turned them on each other, as a disagreement has ballooned into a war of words. Trump has threatened Musk's voluminous business dealings with the federal government, which form the lifeblood of his SpaceX programme. ""The easiest way to save money in our budget, billions and billions of dollars, is to terminate Elon's governmental subsidies and contracts,"" Trump posted menacingly on his own social media website. If Trump turns the machinery of government against Musk, the tech billionaire will feel pain. Tesla's stock price plunged by 14% on Thursday. It's not a one-way street, however. After that volley, Musk called for Trump's impeachment and dared him to cut funding for his companies.  Musk also said he was accelerating the decommissioning of his Dragon spacecraft, which the US relies on to carry American astronauts and supplies to the International Space Station.  But hours later, he appeared to back down from that threat, saying in response to a post on X urging him to cool off: ""Good advice. Ok, we won't decommission Dragon."" Musk has near limitless resources to respond, including by funding insurgent challengers to Republicans in next year's elections and primaries. And late on Thursday afternoon, he said he was dropping the ""really big bomb"" – suggesting without evidence that Trump appears in unreleased files related to late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.  His press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, offered only a tepid pushback to Musk's allegations and accusations. ""This is an unfortunate episode from Elon, who is unhappy with the One Big Beautiful Bill because it does not include the policies he wanted,"" she said.  Musk may not win a fight against the whole of Trump's government, but he could exact a high political - and personal - price for Trump and the Republicans. Trump, perhaps aware of this, appeared to tamp down the heat a bit by the end of the day. He avoided commenting on Musk during a public appearance at a White House event and posted a message on Truth Social that said he didn't mind ""turning against him"", but wishes he had quit government service months ago.  He then pivoted to boosting of his ""big, beautiful"" tax and spending legislation. It's difficult to envision an easy walk-down after Thursday's heat, however. The feud started at a simmer last week, began bubbling on Wednesday and became a full-on boil on Thursday afternoon in the Oval Office. As new German Chancellor Friedrich Merz – the day's visitor – sat in awkward silence, the president sounded a bit like a spurned lover. He expressed surprise at Musk's criticism of his legislation. He pushed back against the notion that he would have lost last year's presidential election without Musk's hundreds of millions of dollars in support. And he said Musk was only changing his tune now because his car company, Tesla, will be hurt by the Republican push to end electric vehicle tax credits. Musk quickly took to his social media site, X, with a very Generation X response for his 220 million followers: ""Whatever"".  He said he didn't care about the car subsidies, and that he wanted to shrink the national debt, which he says is an existential threat to the nation. He insisted that Democrats would have prevailed in last year's election without his help. ""Such ingratitude,"" he told Trump. The billionaire then launched a series of extraordinary attacks throughout the afternoon, and the feud was on in earnest. Musk and Trump had formed a powerful but unlikely alliance, culminating in the tech billionaire having a key position of budget-slashing authority in the Trump administration. Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, or Doge, became one of the biggest stories of Trump's first 100 days, as it shuttered entire agencies and dismissed thousands of government workers. It wasn't long, however, before speculation began over when – and how - the two outsized personalities would ultimately fall out. For a while, it seemed like those predictions were off the mark. Trump stood by Musk even as the latter's popularity dropped, as he feuded with administration officials and as he became a liability in several key elections earlier this year.  Every time it appeared there would be a break, Musk would pop up in the Oval Office, or the Cabinet room or on the president's Air Force One flight to Mar-a-Lago. When Musk's 130 days as a ""special government employee"" ended last week, the two had a chummy Oval Office send-off, with a golden key to the White House and hints that Musk might someday return. It's safe to say that any invitation has been rescinded and the locks have been changed. ""Elon and I had a great relationship,"" Trump said on Thursday – a comment notable for its use of the past tense. There had been some thought that Trump's surprise announcement on Wednesday night of a new travel ban, additional sanctions on Harvard and a conspiracy-laced administration investigation of former President Joe Biden were all efforts to change the subject from Musk's criticism. The White House and its allies in Congress seemed careful not to further antagonise him after his earlier comments. Then Trump spoke out and… so much for that. Now the question is where the dispute goes next. Congressional Republicans could find it harder to keep their members behind Trump's bill with Musk providing rhetorical and, perhaps financial, air cover for those who break ranks. Trump has already threatened Musk's government contracts, but he could also take aim at his remaining Doge allies in the administration or reopen Biden-era investigations into Musk's business dealings. Everything at this point is on the table. Meanwhile, Democrats are on the sidelines, wondering how to respond. Few seem willing to welcome Musk, a former donor to their party, back into the fold. But there's also the old adage that the enemy of an enemy is a friend. ""It's a zero-sum game,"" Liam Kerr, a Democratic strategist, told Politico. ""Anything that he does that moves more toward Democrats hurts Republicans."" At the very least, Democrats seem happy to stand back and let the two men exchange blows. And until they abandon this fight, the din is likely to drown out everything else in American politics. But don't expect this spat to end anytime soon. ""Trump has 3.5 years left as president,"" Musk wrote on X, ""but I will be around for 40-plus years.""

6/6/2025,Article,News,India leads in remittances - but Trump's tax could deal a blow ,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/cvg98erzl8eo,"Tucked deep in Donald Trump's sprawling ""One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act"" is a clause that could quietly take billions from money sent abroad. It proposes a 3.5% tax on remittances sent abroad by foreign workers, including green card holders and temporary visa workers such as those on H-1B visas. For India - the world's top remittance recipient - the implications are serious, say experts. Other major recipients include Mexico, China, the Philippines, France, Pakistan and Bangladesh. In 2023, Indians abroad sent home $119bn (£88bn) - enough to finance half of India's goods trade deficit and outpace foreign direct investment, according to a paper by Reserve Bank of India (RBI) economists. Of this, the largest share came from the US. For millions of migrants, that includes the money wired to cover a parent's medicine, a nephew's tuition or a mortgage back home. A blunt levy on remittances could skim billions from migrant workers, many of whom already pay taxes in America. The likely result? A rise in informal, untraceable cash transfers and a dent in India's most stable source of external financing. India has remained the top recipient of remittances since 2008, with its share rising from 11% in 2001 to 14% in 2024, according to World Bank. India’s central bank says that remittances are expected to stay strong, reaching an estimated $160bn by 2029. The country's remittances have consistently hovered around 3% of GDP since 2000. India's international migrant population grew from 6.6 million in 1990 to 18.5 million in 2024, with its global share rising from 4.3% to over 6%. While the Gulf still hosts nearly half of all Indian migrants, skilled migration to advanced economies - especially the US - has increased significantly, driven by India's global IT footprint.  The US remains the top source of remittances worldwide, with its share rising from 23.4% in 2020–21 to nearly 28% in 2023–24, driven by a strong post-pandemic job recovery and a 6.3% rise in foreign-born workers in 2022. Notably, 78% of Indian migrants in the US work in high-earning sectors such as management, business, science, and the arts. Remittance costs - driven by fees and currency conversion - have long been a global policy concern due to their impact on families. While global averages of the costs remain above targets, India stands out as one of the most affordable destinations, reflecting the rise of digital channels and heightened market competition. A 10-15% drop in remittances could cost India $12-18bn a year, tightening dollar supply and putting pressure on the rupee, according to Ajay Srivastava of Delhi-based think tank Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI). He reckons the central bank may have to step in more often to stabilise the currency. The bigger blow would land on households in states such as Kerala, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, where remittances fund essentials like education, healthcare and housing. The tax could ""hit household consumption hard"" even as the Indian economy grapples with global uncertainty and inflation, Mr Srivastava says in a note. The remittance tax could squeeze Indian household budgets, dampen consumption and investment, and undermine one of India's steadiest sources of foreign exchange, warns a brief by the Delhi-based Centre for WTO Studies. Maharashtra, followed by Kerala and Tamil Nadu, continues to be among the dominant recipient states. Remittances in India are largely used for household consumption, savings and investment in assets like housing, gold and small businesses. according to a policy brief by the think tank's Pritam Banerjee, Saptarshee Mandal and Divyansh Dua.  A drop in inflows could shrink domestic savings and reduce investment in both financial and physical assets. When remittance inflows decline, households are likely to ""prioritise consumption needs (e.g. food, healthcare, and education) over savings and investment"", the brief says. A study by Center for Global Development, a Washington-based think tank, suggests the proposed tax could sharply cut formal transfers, with Mexico facing the biggest hit - over $2.6bn annually. Other major losers include India, China, Vietnam and several Latin American nations like Guatemala, the Dominican Republic and El Salvador. To be sure, there's still some confusion surrounding the tax, and final approval is pending Senate action and the President's signature. ""The tax applies to all non-citizens and even embassy and UN/World Bank staff. But those who pay taxes can claim a tax credit. Thus, the remittance tax would apply only to those migrants who do not pay taxes. That would mostly include unauthorised migrants (and diplomats),"" Dilip Ratha, the World Bank lead economist for migration and remittances, told the BBC. Dr Ratha wrote in a note on LinkedIn that migrants would try to cut remittance costs by turning to informal methods - hand-carrying cash, sending money through friends, couriers, bus drivers or airline staff, arranging local currency payouts via friends in the US, or using hawala, hundi and cryptocurrencies.  ""Will the proposed tax deter unauthorised immigration to the US? Will it encourage unauthorised migrants to return home?"" wonders Dr Ratha. Not quite, he says. A minimum wage job in the US earns over $24,000 a year -  roughly four to 30 times more than in many developing countries. Migrants typically send home between $1,800 and $48,000 annually, estimates Dr Ratha.  ""A 3.5% tax is unlikely to deter these remittances. After all the main motivation for migration - migrants trying to cross oceans and rivers and mountains - is to send money home to help helpless family members.""   Copyright 2025 BBC.

6/6/2025,Article,News,India central bank delivers sharp rate cut as growth and inflation fall,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/c62vdq6g945o,"India's central bank has lowered interest rates by a deeper-than-expected half a percent - the third cut in a row amid falling inflation and lower growth in Asia's third largest economy.  It also increased the amount of liquidity - or supply of money - available in the system.  The repo rate - the level at which the central bank lends money to commercial banks, influencing borrowing costs for home and car loans - now stands at 5.5%, the lowest in three years. Explaining the rationale for the cut, RBI governor Sanjay Malhotra said growth is  ""lower than our aspirations"" and the bank felt it was ""imperative to stimulate domestic consumption and investment"" amid rising global uncertainties. The rate cut comes on the back of two previous reductions in April and February. Data released last week showed that India's economy grew by 6.5% in the previous financial year ending March. The country remains the world's fastest expanding major economy, although growth has sharply dropped from the 9.2% high recorded in financial year 2023-24. Meanwhile, retail prices in India have slowed faster than expected to 3.16% in April - the lowest in six years - and below the RBI's 4% target, driven down by falling food prices. RBI has now forecast lower inflation than earlier projected for the year ahead. But the central bank has changed its monetary policy stance from ""accommodative"" to ""neutral"", indicating that further rate cuts will depend on how India's growth-inflation dynamic evolves. However, fuller granaries due to a better-than-expected monsoon, weaker prices of commodities like oil - of which India is a net importer - as well as a strong currency are likely to help keep India's inflation in check in the months ahead, allowing the RBI to keep rates low. Lower borrowing costs could have a positive growth impact due to improved purchasing power for households, lower input costs for companies and lower debt servicing costs for the government. They will also help homebuyers and a struggling real estate sector. ""This effectively lowers the cost of borrowing, making home loan EMIs [mortgage payments] easier on the pocket and thereby directly improving affordability for buyers. This can potentially boost demand in the Indian real estate sector, especially in affordable and mid-income segments. Affordable housing faced the sharpest pandemic fallout, with sales and new launches shrinking in the top 7 cities,"" Anuj Puri, chairman of ANAROCK Group, said.  Indian markets rallied sharply post the rate cut announcement.  Copyright 2025 BBC.

6/6/2025,Article,News,Bouncy castle operator cleared in tragedy that killed six,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/c4gr5kn5d7go,"An Australian bouncy castle operator at the centre of a tragedy in 2021 that killed six children and seriously injured three has been cleared of breaching safety laws. A court found Rosemary Anne Gamble, who runs the business Taz-Zorb, not guilty, ruling that the incident was ""due to an unprecedented weather system"" that was ""impossible to predict"". The victims, who were on a bouncy castle at a primary school fun day in Devonport, Tasmania, fell about 10m (33ft) after strong winds blew the castle skywards at a school fair. The verdict on Friday caused anguish among their families, with some crying out in court in disbelief, ABC News reported. Prosecutors had accused Ms Gamble of failing to anchor the castle adequately, but her defence argued she could not have done more to eliminate or reduce hazards that led to the tragedy. Magistrate Robert Webster agreed with the defence and found that the incident happened due to a dust devil - an upward spiralling vortex of air and debris - that was ""unforeseen and unforeseeable"". ""Ms Gamble could have done more or taken further steps, however, given the effects of the unforeseen and unforeseeable dust devil, had she done so, that would sadly have made no difference to the ultimate outcome,"" the magistrate said. The six children killed in the accident - Addison Stewart, Zane Mellor, Jye Sheehan, Jalailah Jayne-Maree Jones, Peter Dodt and Chace Harrison - were aged between 11 and 12. They were all at a Hillcrest Primary School fair when the accident took place on the last day of term before the school holidays in December 2021. Five of the children were on the castle when the gales swept it up and flung it across the school oval.  The sixth child, who was waiting in line, died after being struck in the head by the inflatable blower. The tragic accident shattered Devonport, a city on the north coast of Tasmania with some 30,000 residents. Ms Gamble was charged nearly two years after, in November 2023.  Andrew Dodt, the father of one of the young victims Peter, said after Friday's verdict that ""our hopes are just shattered now"". ""At the end of the day all I wanted was an apology for my son not coming home, and I'm never going to get it, and that kills me,"" he said in a statement to local media. ""I've been broken for a long time, and I think I'm going to be broken for a lot more."" Ms Gamble's lawyer Bethan Frake spoke on her behalf, acknowledging that the incident has caused ""scars that will remain for an extremely long time, likely forever"". ""I am a mother,"" she said, quoting Ms Gamble. ""I can only imagine the pain that other parents are living with each and every day because of this terrible thing that happened."" ""Their loss is something I will carry with me for the rest of my life."" Copyright 2025 BBC.

6/6/2025,Article,News,India central bank delivers sharp rate cut as growth and inflation fall,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/c62vdq6g945o,"India's central bank has lowered interest rates by a deeper-than-expected half a percent - the third cut in a row amid falling inflation and lower growth in Asia's third largest economy.  It also increased the amount of liquidity - or supply of money - available in the system.  The repo rate - the level at which the central bank lends money to commercial banks, influencing borrowing costs for home and car loans - now stands at 5.5%, the lowest in three years. Explaining the rationale for the cut, RBI governor Sanjay Malhotra said growth is  ""lower than our aspirations"" and the bank felt it was ""imperative to stimulate domestic consumption and investment"" amid rising global uncertainties. The rate cut comes on the back of two previous reductions in April and February. Data released last week showed that India's economy grew by 6.5% in the previous financial year ending March. The country remains the world's fastest expanding major economy, although growth has sharply dropped from the 9.2% high recorded in financial year 2023-24. Meanwhile, retail prices in India have slowed faster than expected to 3.16% in April - the lowest in six years - and below the RBI's 4% target, driven down by falling food prices. RBI has now forecast lower inflation than earlier projected for the year ahead. But the central bank has changed its monetary policy stance from ""accommodative"" to ""neutral"", indicating that further rate cuts will depend on how India's growth-inflation dynamic evolves. However, fuller granaries due to a better-than-expected monsoon, weaker prices of commodities like oil - of which India is a net importer - as well as a strong currency are likely to help keep India's inflation in check in the months ahead, allowing the RBI to keep rates low. Lower borrowing costs could have a positive growth impact due to improved purchasing power for households, lower input costs for companies and lower debt servicing costs for the government. They will also help homebuyers and a struggling real estate sector. ""This effectively lowers the cost of borrowing, making home loan EMIs [mortgage payments] easier on the pocket and thereby directly improving affordability for buyers. This can potentially boost demand in the Indian real estate sector, especially in affordable and mid-income segments. Affordable housing faced the sharpest pandemic fallout, with sales and new launches shrinking in the top 7 cities,"" Anuj Puri, chairman of ANAROCK Group, said.  Indian markets rallied sharply post the rate cut announcement.  Copyright 2025 BBC.

6/6/2025,Article,News,Handwritten notes reveal Churchill's penicillin concern ahead of D-Day,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/cj09v52l8v4o,"Winston Churchill's push to obtain penicillin in time to treat casualties expected from D-Day has come to light in documents seen by BBC News. Official papers unearthed by the National Archives reveal the prime minister's frustration and concern over slow progress securing supplies of what was then seen to be a brand new ""wonder drug"". The BBC was shown the papers ahead of the anniversary of the Normandy landings on 6 June 1944. Even months after D-Day, the wartime prime minister called efforts ""very disappointing"" and bemoaned the fact the US was ""so far ahead"" despite the drug being a ""British discovery"". Penicillin was discovered in London by Professor Alexander Fleming in 1928. Despite attempts to produce a usable medicine from the bacteria-killing mould, this had not been achieved by the start of World War Two.  But an Oxford team of scientists, led by Howard Florey, carried out the first successful trials. With large-scale production difficult in the UK, they took their research to the United States, where drug companies expanded output. Before the development of penicillin, blood poisoning could follow even minor wounds with no cure available. So with the anticipation of the huge military effort ahead, supplies of the drug were seen as essential. Early in 1944, the prime minister was complaining to his ministers about Britain's inability to produce it at scale. He scrawled in red ink on a Ministry of Supply report that said the Americans were producing greater quantities: ""I am sorry we can't produce more"". Later in the year, in response to explanations from officials, he said: ""Your report on penicillin showing that we are only to get about one-tenth of the expected output this year, is very disappointing.""  On another report, he instructs: ""Let me have proposals for a more abundant supply from Great Britain"".  Less than a fortnight before D-Day, health officials could report that sufficient supplies had been obtained, most from the US, but only for battle casualties. Dr Jessamy Carlson, modern records specialist at The National Archives, said: ""The files give a glimpse into the extraordinary levels of preparation undertaken in advance of the D-Day landings.  ""Only six weeks before, penicillin is just reaching our shores in quantities which will allow it to play a major role in improving the outcomes for service personnel wounded in action."" But what's now seen as the first true antibiotic would not be fully available to the general public till 1946.  A telegram in the same files shows a doctor from Cornwall, who was treating a 10-year-old child in 1944, pleading with the authorities for the medicine: ""No hope without penicillin"".  The plea was rejected, with supplies said to be only available for military use. With antibiotics now part of everyday life (and arguably too widely used), the documents seen by the BBC shed new light on the urgent efforts by Churchill and others to secure enough of one such drug for the first time to save lives during the struggle to liberate northern Europe.

6/6/2025,Article,Future,The 'giant firework' built to break Hitler's Atlantic Wall,https://www.bbc.com//future/article/20250603-the-giant-firework-built-to-break-hitlers-atlantic-wall,"To make D-Day a success, the Allies thought they might have to break through formidable German defences. One unconventional idea was a ""giant firework"" that would deliver a one-tonne bomb: the Panjandrum. After conquering much of Western Europe in the first few years of World War II, Nazi Germany then diverted a huge effort into protecting what it had invaded. Once the United States entered the war on the side of the Allies in late 1941, the threat of invasion from the sea went from a distinct possibility to certainty. To prevent it, hundreds of thousands of forced labourers – some of them Russian prisoners captured on the Eastern Front – were set to work. They built walls, tank traps and reinforced-concrete emplacements. The fortifications stretched around 5,000km (3,105 miles) from France's border with Spain all the way to the northern tip of Norway.  Adolf Hitler called it the ""Atlantic Wall"", and there are still many traces of it, littering beaches from the Bay of Biscay to the sub-Arctic fjords.  Allied military planners had many challenges to wrestle with during their long preparations for the liberation of Europe. Seizing a port made the most sense – it would be easier to get vital supplies to the troops on the beachhead by unloading ships more speedily on the docks. But the ports on the English Channel coast had been heavily fortified by German defenders. A bold plan to temporarily take over one of these ports – Dieppe, in France – in August 1942 showed how difficult a port would be to capture. Thousands of mostly Canadian troops were killed or captured in a botched attempt to push through defences; supporting tanks became bogged down on loose shingle sand and the built-up surroundings gave the defenders plenty of cover from which to fire on the invading forces. Dieppe, it turned out, had the wrong kind of beach. The French coast had plenty of beaches firm enough to support tanks and other vehicles coming ashore, but these beaches would be overlooked by the Atlantic Wall defences the Germans were quickly building. How could they be breached, with the minimum loss to Allied soldiers? An eccentric plan was born…  Nevil Shute Norway was an accomplished aeronautical engineer who had worked on one of Britain's most high-profile airship designs. The R100 airship had been designed by engineer Barnes Wallis – who would later invent the bouncing bomb of Dambusters fame – for engineering firm Vickers, with funding from the government. Norway later took over as chief engineer when Wallis left to work on other projects. The R100, intended for long-distance voyages across the British Empire, carried out successful publicity tours as far afield as Canada. It was developed alongside a similar airship designed and built by the UK's Air Ministry, called R101; this design was fatally flawed, and crashed with the loss of 48 lives in northern France while on its maiden flight.  News of the crash flashed around the world, killing Britain's emerging airship industry for good, and Norway drifted into more conventional aircraft designs, including the highly successful Oxford trainer designed by his own aircraft company, Airspeed. When war broke out, Norway joined the Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve, initially serving on naval ships. But his flair for engineering took him in a different direction: into the navy's secret department for experimental weapons. The Directorate of Miscellaneous Weapon Development was known informally as the ""wheezers and dodgers"". They drew bookish, lab-bound talent from the UK's universities and research institutes and challenged them to come up with new weapons that could be used in the war. No idea, however outlandish, was discouraged. One of the weapons the British armed forces needed was something that could be deployed from a ship and was powerful enough to breach the strong concrete sea wall now in place across much of Europe. From there, Allied forces could hopefully capture the ports needed to sustain a sea invasion from behind, where they would be less well-defended. Norway and team did the calculations and arrived at a minimum explosive weight to break through the concrete defences: a tonne of high explosives. Placed against the wall, this should be enough to blow a tank-sized hole that will allow invading troops and vehicles to pour through. But to drive it up across a well-defended beach was likely to be too hazardous. Norway and the naval research team turns to an unlikely inspiration: a firework known as the Catherine wheel. The firework uses part of the energy of the rocket, which is usually pinned to the structure, to spin; it makes a much more impressive display. Enough rockets, the team calculated, could generate enough energy to propel a one-tonne bomb all the way up to the beach to hit the concrete wall.  Obviously, to be able to hold a one-tonne bomb, the device would need to be a very large Catherine wheel, one that could be controlled remotely.  Norway and his team eventually came up with a device that looked like a large film reel, with two wheels 10ft (3m) high, on either side of a large steel tank that contained the explosive charge. Spaced around either side of the two giant wheels were a series of rockets containing cordite (gunpowder) which could be controlled remotely and would propel the device forward once the rockets ignited. The contraption might reach speeds in excess of 60mph (100 km/h), giving it enough momentum to push through any obstacles until it hit the wall. Norway and his team called their device ""the Panjandrum"". The Panjandrum exemplifies the anything-goes attitude that British military thinkers adopted, says David Willey, the recently retired curator at The Tank Museum in Bovington in the UK. And it also feeds into a kind of ""national myth"", he says, that there is always some kind of unconventional inventor that will save the day. ""We love this idea,"" he says. ""We've got all these boffins with round thick glasses in back rooms all over the place that we task to come up with answers and they're always going to be saying 'If only they'd listened to me earlier'. They're fed questions, they're told the problem.""  ""This idea of blasting holes in sea walls or major defensive wall is quite a big one,"" Willey adds. The idea, however far-fetched it sounds now, the idea of some massive Catherine wheel with rockets on and it goes over rolls towards wherever where it's then detonated with a huge charge."" The Panjandrum comes before an age of miniaturised electronics, but in a way it presages the age of the drone – a weapon that can be sent into battle without a human needing to pilot it.  ""In its broadest sense the Panjandrum makes a lot of sense because you're delivering a huge amount of explosives to one single point, the concrete encasements and the Atlantic Wall,"" says Rob Rumble, a curator at the Imperial War Museums in the UK. He says the Panjandrum had to do three things: it had to be robust enough to carry its heavy load up the beach, it had to be able to carry enough explosives to successfully breach the concrete, and it had to be able to do this accurately – ""which was the great failing in the end"".  ""In many ways, I'm also sceptical as to its ability to roll over those defences as well,"" adds Rumble. ""So in a way, the only thing going for it was the fact that it could carry a huge amount of explosives."" The Panjandrum was built in secret in east London and then transported to the west of England for testing. The first test took place at Westward Ho! in Devon in September 1943. The need to test it on a beach conditions completely scuppered the project's secrecy. The team had to test it in front of a crowd of curious civilians, who ignored military warnings that the machine was possibly hazardous. The Panjandrum was successfully launched from a landing craft, but as it moved up the beach rockets on one of the wheels detached, and the lumbering machine quickly blundered off to the side. Norway and his team made many modifications to the Panjandrum and its array of rockets, but several more tests fared little better. One video which has been preserved by the Imperial War Museum in London shows the weapon careering over the beach throwing up a huge spray of sand and seawater – all the while being chased by an excited dog. (Panjandrum footage starts at 2.51.) ""You know it always makes me laugh when we see this footage of this top-secret stuff and there seems to be half a dozen families down there sitting around having a picnic at the same time in the background."" With the planned invasion of France drawing ever closer, time was running out to finetune the Panjandrum. In January 1944 – just five months before the eventual D-Day landings – a last test took place in front of a crowd of military observers. In 1977, the BBC produced a documentary series called The Secret War, and producer Brian Johnson described the final Panjandrum test: ""At first all went well. Panjandrum rolled into the sea and began to head for the shore, the brass hats watching through binoculars from the top of a pebble ridge [...] Then a clamp gave: first one, then two more rockets broke free: Panjandrum began to lurch ominously. It hit a line of small craters in the sand and began to turn to starboard, careering towards [photographer Louis] Klemantaski, who, viewing events through a telescopic lens, misjudged the distance and continued filming. Hearing the approaching roar he looked up from his viewfinder to see Panjandrum, shedding live rockets in all directions, heading straight for him. ""As he ran for his life, he glimpsed the assembled admirals and generals diving for cover behind the pebble ridge into barbed-wire entanglements. Panjandrum was now heading back to the sea but crashed on to the sand where it disintegrated in violent explosions, rockets tearing across the beach at great speed."" Panjandrum had failed for the final time, and the project was quietly scrapped. The idea of a weapon that would make its way to its target under its own steam was outlandish for the time, but makes far more sense today, says Rumble. ""In its concept the Panjandrum was a good idea, you know, the sort of indirect unmanned weapons that you see today but in much more advanced form with drone warfare. But otherwise, the technology to drive and navigate the machine just wasn't there at the time.""  ""Hindsight is wonderful,"" says Willey. ""'This one doesn't work.' Lots of experiments we do don't work. Now, that doesn't mean to say all those experiments are therefore failures. Because number one is you're writing something off the list. So often technology jumps from one project to another, you'll see that happening loads of times. ""In many ways, it baffles me to a certain extent, that the, the solid rocket power was even considered an idea,"" says Rumble. ""Little solid booster rockets aren't 100% an exact science either, depending on how much fuel you have in each one, and how successfully they ignite."" In the end, success on the D-Day beaches came partly due to another unconventional weapon – modified tanks collectively known as ""Funnies"". Led by the eccentric Percy Hobart, normal tanks were modified to do everything from swim to shore using canvas floatation devices, clear minefields with whirling chains, lay steel matting over soft sand or lob dustbin-sized shells at concrete emplacements. They played a massive part in making the landings on 6 June 1944 a success. As for Norway? Panjandrum was a failure, but other projects Shute Norway masterminded during his time in the Navy – such as an anti-submarine depth charge system called ""Hedgehog"" – were far more successful. But engineering was just one of his callings. Since the 1920s, he had been publishing stories and novels, writing under a pen name because he worried his fiction could detract from the seriousness of his engineering. His pen-name? Nevil Shute. In the years after the war, he became one of the world's most popular novelists. The Panjandrum remains a dazzling example of an unconventional approach to warfare, abandoned when tests proved its shortcomings. But could it have been made to work? In recent years, some non-military minds have decided to give the idea another pass, such as Adam Savage, the former Mythbusters host who now fronts the TV programme Savage Builds. In 2020, Savage decided to see if he could improve the design enough that it might be able to carry out a peacetime mission, building a miniature Panjandrum. Putting five rockets on each wheel generated more than 10 times the thrust-to-weight ratio, and a slight delay in one of the rockets firing caused the machine to careen wildly off course. Cutting it down to three rockets each side helped, but the results were still far from successful. Another, bigger Panjandrum was built in 2009 to mark the 65th anniversary of the D-Day landings. Constructed for the Appledore Book Festival, it was created by Skyburst, an industrial pyrotechnics company based in Bristol in the UK. ""We got contacted by a chap from the book festival, to say, 'You know, we're thinking of doing this, is this something you could help with?'"" says Alan Christie, the owner of Skyburst. ""I mean, we love doing fireworks, but it's always great to have something different, you know."" Skyburst's Panjandrum, like Savage's, did not contain an explosive charge. But it was much bigger, with the wheels reaching 6ft high (1.8m). Christie knew very little about the Panjandrum, and had do a crash course in the weapon's design. ""It was really good to actually get involved and learn more about it."" Christie says wistfully that it was ""a shame"" they couldn't use the same kind of solid-fuel rockets as the wildly unpredictable original. The centre of their Panjandrum was a large cable drum, to which the team from Skyburst attached a number of rocket motors, before it was moved down to the beach and launched. ""It probably took us about five, six hours in total, to attach all the drivers and get it in position on the beach,"" says Christie. ""One of the things I wanted to try and simulate it as the landing craft pulled up they dropped down the front of it like a ramp, and it [the Panjandrum] was supposed to roll off. So we built a small ramp ourselves, and then we tied it up with what we call it 'black match', it's just like plastic-covered gunpowder rope. ""We fired it, and it fired the black match as well, which released it and let it go."" Christie says Skyburst tried to make their miniaturised Panjandrum as faithful as possible to the original.  More like this: • The flawed Soviet glider tank • The shape of tanks to come • The strange tanks that helped win D-Day  ""We got it about 50m (165ft),"" he says. ""It looked spectacular. I think it actually looked better than the originals did, with all the sparks snarling off it and stuff."" There is no doubt that this odd weapon was built – we have the pictures, footage and testimony of confused onlookers to corroborate it – but there remains a tantalising hint that the Panjandrum may have been an elaborate ploy to fool the German defenders that the Normandy landings were to take place far closer to one of the fortified ports. Was the Panjandrum ultimately an intelligence tool, rather than something that would have been used in anger? ""I think it was a trick, to be honest,"" says Christie. ""They were very open about testing it. A lot of the other secret weapons that they built, nobody got to see what they were or knew anything about them. It was supposed to roll up the beach and hit certain defences. When you look at the Normandy beaches, there was barbed wire and things like that, but there wasn't anything for them to actually crash it into."" Perhaps the Panjandrum was not intended to be a secret weapon at all…  -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.

6/6/2025,Article,Culture,A death-defying D-day mission in a wooden glider,https://www.bbc.com//culture/article/20240531-how-ww2s-d-day-began-with-a-death-defying-mission-in-a-wooden-aircraft,"Eighty years ago on 6 June, D-Day, the largest land, air and naval operation in history was unleashed to fight the Nazis – led by a group of British troops who crash-landed in Normandy in six flimsy gliders. In 1984, the man who led this mission gave an extraordinary account to the BBC. D-Day was a marvel of planning; it involved the simultaneous landing of tens of thousands of Allied troops on five separate beaches in Nazi-occupied northern France. The British and Canadians would land on three beaches in Normandy, codenamed Sword, Juno and Gold. The Americans were to capture Omaha and Utah beaches.  Major John Howard and his company's part in this elaborate plan required perfect navigation, great daring and complete surprise. Their mission was to capture two bridges intact – Bénouville Bridge, later known as Pegasus Bridge, over the Caen canal, and Ranville Bridge, later renamed Horsa Bridge, over the adjacent River Orne. Because these road bridges were the only way across the parallel water obstacles, capturing them would mean they could stop German reinforcements from reaching the beaches where the Allied armies would land later that day.   Preparation for this audacious glider mission was intense. Thousands of aerial photographs were taken of the bridges and their defences mapped in detail. The British even created a model of the area which was modified to match each day's aerial photograph. When the Germans cut down trees, the model-makers did the same. The idea of using gliders was that troops and heavier weapons could be landed in the same place behind enemy lines, without the need for parachutes. Because of the need to conserve metal supplies during wartime, the gliders were made mostly of spruce and plywood. They were tricky to operate, and liable to break apart upon landing.   Major Howard's 180-strong company of the Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry, from the 6th Airborne Division, had been training for this moment for two years. For many, this would be their first experience of combat. After abandoning their crashed aircraft, they would have to have to fight on foot.   While the name ""glider"" may imply a calm journey, Major Howard admitted to BBC current affairs programme 60 Minutes in 1984 that travelling in these aircraft was anything but smooth. ""Most of us were sick in gliders, but the funny thing is that the only time I was never sick in a glider, and I must have done 12 or 13 flights altogether with training, was on the night of D-Day,"" he said. Towed by heavy bomber planes, the six gliders took off from Tarrant Rushton, a Royal Air Force base in southern England, at 22:56 on 5 June 1944. After about an hour in the air, the gliders were released from their restraints to begin their final descent into enemy territory.   Major Howard said when the order was given to prepare for landing, all they could do was interlock arms and fingers with their comrades and hope for the best. ""You're sitting facing one another, you link arms, you do a butcher's grip like that, you lift your legs and you just pray to God,"" he said. ""Before we almost had time to do that, there was the first thump of a landing, and it was a hell of a crash. And before we knew it, we were airborne again – we'd obviously bounced. On that first bounce, the wheels had come off.   More like this: • The WW2 army that didn't exist • Britain's mysterious WW2 'Island of Death' • The 1970 student protest that shook the US ""We expected that because it was a very bumpy old field, it wasn't like an airfield, and we were going to land on skids. Then there was another thundering crash, and this time I saw sparks, or what looked like Tracer (bullets) going past the door of the window, and I thought, 'my God, they're ready for us. They know we've arrived.'"" The glider bounced again and then came to a juddering halt. They had survived the crash landing. Would they now be met with a hail of German bullets? For Major Howard, everything went dark. ""It occurred to me that there was no firing, and I couldn't see anything,"" he said. ""The first fear was that I'd been blinded in the crash. I felt my body, that felt alright, and then I realised that all that happened was my battle bowler had come down over my eyes. I'd hit the top of the glider."" With only moonlight to guide them, the gliders had landed in silence just 30 metres (98 ft) from their target.   The German garrison was taken by surprise, as Colonel Hans von Luck acknowledged 40 years later. Major Howard and Colonel von Luck would later become good friends in the 1960s through their involvement in giving military lectures, and both men were back in Normandy for the 40th anniversary. Colonel Von Luck said they had not treated these bridges as being important as they believed there were too many complicating factors that prevented the Allies to attack there. ""I think it was a fantastic operation, and I think personally that was the beginning of the end,"" he said.   While Major Howard and his men had won the first battle of D-Day, the disadvantage of going in first was they were left to defend the bridges on their own for hours until reinforcements arrived via sea. When Nazi tanks rumbled in to attack, Charles ""Wagger"" Thornton was lying in wait in a nearby hedgerow, armed with his PIAT (Projector, Infantry, Anti-Tank) weapon, and trying desperately to hold his nerve. ""These PIATs, they're not very effective past 50 yards, so you've got to wait for 30 to 40 yards to get the best out of them,"" he told 60 Minutes. ""The more this bloody tank kept coming, the more shaken I was getting. Anyhow I waited and I thought to myself, 'Well this is it', because it was dark as well, and I let go. Lucky for me, it hit the thing smack in the middle."" At that same time, local café owners Georges and Thérèse Gondrée were sheltering with their children in the cellars. Soon afterwards, Georges was in the garden digging up 98 bottles of champagne which had remained buried throughout the war, waiting for this day. They were the first people in France to be liberated from the Nazis. Major Howard carried with him an unforgettable mental image of that moment. ""Dear Madame, of course, went round kissing all my men and all the paras and all our black camouflage paint was transferred to her face,"" he said. ""That dear old soul, she wandered around that café with that black paint on for three days. She wouldn't wash it off.""  In History is a series which uses the BBC's unique audio and video archive to explore historical events that still resonate today. Subscribe to the accompanying weekly newsletter. Forty years on, Major Howard reunited with Madame Gondrée to lay a wreath at the grave of Lieutenant Den Brotheridge, the first Allied soldier to be killed on D-Day. Shortly after his glider landed, Lt Brotheridge was shot as he led the charge across Pegasus Bridge. His only daughter Margaret would be born 19 days later, but it wasn't until that same 40th anniversary that she discovered just what happened to him. All she knew while growing up was her father had died in the war, her mother remarried when she was aged four and didn't like to talk about it.   Speaking to the BBC in 2014, she said: ""I found out just before I was 40. I opened up the paper, and there was this big picture of my father's group and it had Brotheridge on it and I said, 'Oh my, just look at this.'""  On D-Day alone, as many as 4,400 Allied troops died, with some 9,000 wounded or missing. Total German casualties are estimated as being between 4,000 and 9,000 men. Thousands of French civilians also died, mainly as a result of bombing raids carried out by Allied forces.  The story of the airborne assault on Pegasus Bridge in the early hours of 6 June 1944 was immortalised in the 1962 film The Longest Day. Major Howard was played by the actor Richard Todd, who himself parachuted into Normandy on D-Day. Interviewed shortly before his death in 1999 aged 86, Major Howard laughed at how he was portrayed, describing it as sentimental rubbish.   -- For more stories and never-before-published radio scripts to your inbox, sign up to the In History newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.

6/6/2025,Article,News,Trump and Musk trade insults as row erupts in public view,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/c5yg98rl717o,"The rift between US President Donald Trump and his former adviser Elon Musk has erupted into the open, with each trading insults after the tech billionaire criticised one of Trump's key domestic policies.  The two billionaires escalated the feud throughout Thursday, lobbing barbs at each other on the social media sites they each own, suggesting a bitter conclusion to their unlikely alliance. The day began with Trump saying he was ""disappointed"" with Musk's criticisms of his administration's centrepiece tax and spending bill, musing that it may be the end of their ""great relationship"". Musk then accused Trump of ""ingratitude"", adding: ""Without me, Trump would have lost the election"". After hours of sparring, Trump appeared to downplay the situation. ""Oh it's okay,"" he told news site Politico. ""It's going very well, never done better."" His aides have scheduled a phone call with Musk for Friday, the same news site reported. Musk also appeared to believe there was a need to patch things up. Late on Thursday, in response to post by Bill Ackman, a prominent Trump backer, which suggested the pair needed to make peace, he wrote: ""You're not wrong"". The breaking point in the relationship between the president and his one-time ally came after weeks of Musk lobbying against Trump's ""big, beautiful"" spending bill, which was passed by the US House last month and is awaiting a vote in the Senate.  Shortly after leaving the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) after 129 days in the job, Musk took to his site X to call the bill a ""disgusting abomination"" and posting: ""Shame on those who voted for it: you know you did wrong.""  He argued that the bill will irresponsibly add to the US national debt, and encouraged his followers to phone their representatives to express opposition to the spending plan. Speaking to reporters during a news conference with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz on Thursday, Trump defending the bill and said: ""I'm very disappointed because Elon knew the inner workings of this bill better than almost anybody sitting here. All of a sudden he had a problem."" He went on to suggest that Musk was upset about the removal of subsidies and mandates for electric vehicles, which could affect his Tesla business. Musk denied this was the case and wrote: ""Keep the EV/solar incentive cuts in the bill, even though no oil & gas subsidies are touched (very unfair!!), but ditch the MOUNTAIN of DISGUSTING PORK in the bill."" ""Pork"" is a term used in US politics to describe wasteful government spending, particularly on things meant to curry favour with particular groups or local areas.  The partnership between the two men began when Musk endorsed Trump last July after an assassination attempt in Pennsylvania. The Tesla boss reportedly funnelled $290m (£213m) into getting him back into the White House. Amid a flurry of posts on X after Thursday's news conference, Musk took credit for the sweeping Republican victory in last November's election, writing: ""Without me, Trump would have lost the election, Dems would control the House and the Republicans would be 51-49 in the Senate."" ""Such ingratitude,"" he added. Musk went on to post a poll, asking his followers: ""Is it time to create a new political party in America that actually represents the 80% in the middle?""  Over the course of the day, Musk went on to repost a tweet calling for Trump to resign, argue that his global tariff plan will trigger a US recession, and to suggest without evidence that Trump appears in unreleased files related to late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.  Epstein was arrested in July 2019 on charges of sex trafficking and died by suicide while awaiting trial. Trump was president at the time. He said he knew Epstein ""like everybody in Palm Beach knew him"" but had a ""falling out with him a long time ago"".  The White House condemned Musk's allegation, with press secretary Karoline Leavitt saying in a statement: ""This is an unfortunate episode from Elon, who is unhappy with the One Big Beautiful Bill because it does not include the policies he wanted."" On his Truth Social network, Trump claimed that Musk ""just went CRAZY"" and went on to post: ""The easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon's Governmental Subsidies and Contracts. I was always surprised that Biden didn't do it!"" Musk's companies, including Tesla, SpaceX and Starlink have direct contacts with the US government and, like many other businesses, also benefit from subsidies and tax breaks. In response, Musk said SpaceX ""will begin decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft immediately"". The craft is used to shuttle people and supplies to the International Space Station.  However, he later he appeared to back down from that threat, saying in response to a post on X urging him to cool off: ""Ok, we won't decommission Dragon."" Telsa stock dropped by 14% within hours of the row bursting out into public.  According to the most recent analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the spending bill working its way through Congress will increase the US national debt by $2.4tn over 10 years and leave nearly 11 million people without government-backed health insurance. The White House disputes those figures, saying they don't account for revenues brought in by increased tariffs. Put in charge of radically slashing government spending at Doge, Musk initiated mass sackings and wholesale elimination of departments such as the US Agency for International Development (USAID). Doge claims to have saved $180bn, although that number has been disputed, and is well short of Musk's initial aim to cut spending by up to $2tn.

6/6/2025,Article,News,Former Zambian President Lungu dies aged 68,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/cn4gp07y3xmo,"Zambia's former President Edgar Lungu has died at the age of 68, his party has said in a statement. He had ""been receiving specialized treatment in South Africa"" for an undisclosed illness, the Patriotic Front (PF) added. Lungu led Zambia for six years from 2015, losing the 2021 election to the current President Hakainde Hichilema by a large margin. After that defeat he stepped back from politics but later returned to the fray. He had ambitions to vie for the presidency again but at the end of last year the Constitutional Court barred him from running, ruling that he had already served the maximum two terms allowed by law. Even after being disqualified from running once more for the presidency, he remained hugely influential in Zambian politics and did not hold back in his criticism of his successor. In a short video, Lungu's daughter Tasila said that the former head of state, who had been ""under medical supervision in recent weeks"", died at a clinic in South Africa's capital, Pretoria, at 06:00 (04:00 GMT) on Thursday. ""In this moment of grief, we invoke the spirit of 'One Zambia, One Nation' - the timeless creed that guided President Lungu's service to our country,"" she added in an emotional statement. There was no mention of what his condition was, but a decade ago he underwent throat surgery abroad. At the time his office said he was suffering from a narrowing of the oesophagus. In his condolence message, President Hichilema called for ""solemnity, unity and an outpouring of love and compassion. ""Let us come together as one people, above political affiliation or personal conviction, to honour the life of a man who once held the highest office in our land."" Cyril Ramaphosa, the president of South Africa, where Lungu was being treated, wrote that it was a ""privilege in recent weeks to care for a leader from our region whom we embraced as a brother and friend. We therefore share the grief and loss experienced."" Kenya's President William Ruto described Lungu as a ""progressive and outstanding leader who served the people of Zambia with zeal and commitment"". Lungu first became president in January 2015 after winning a special presidential election triggered by the death in office of Michael Sata. After completing Sata's term, he won a further five years in power in 2016 taking just over 50% of the vote. But after six years at the helm, Lungu, who encouraged Chinese investment and enlisted the country's help in infrastructure development, was blamed for a struggling economy, high unemployment and rising debt levels.  His time in office was also marred by corruption scandals involving his allies and relatives. Lungu always denied wrongdoing. His party's youth wing was accused of harassing opposition supporters, and the population at large. Lungu lost in 2021 by close to a million votes with Hichilema, seen as more pro-Western, tapping into widespread dissatisfaction among the electorate. He said he was retiring in the aftermath of the vote, but returned to frontline politics in 2023 as his successor's popularity waned. ""I am ready to fight from the front, not from the rear, in defence of democracy. Those who are ready for this fight, please come along with me, I am ready for anything,"" Mr Lungu told supporters at the time. After returning to politics, the former president complained of police harassment. At one point last year he said he was ""virtually under house arrest"". ""I cannot move out of my house without being accosted and challenged by the police and driving me back home"", Lungu told the BBC's Newsday programme. In the interview in May 2024, he alleged that he had been barred from attending a conference abroad and from travelling for medical treatment. In 2023, the police warned him against jogging in public, describing his weekly workouts as ""political activism"". The government said that Lungu had ""never been placed under house arrest"" and that he was free to exercise his rights. Lungu was a lawyer by training but enjoyed a meteoric rise in politics after winning a seat in parliament as a PF MP in 2011. He entered government as deputy minister in the vice-president's office in that year and rose to become minister of home affairs in just over 12 months. He later became minister of defence and then justice. A close friend described Lungu as a ""good foot-soldier, lawyer and politician, father, husband and grandparent"". Born on 11 November 1956, Lungu graduated with a law degree from the University of Zambia in 1981. He also underwent military training at the then Miltez army college in Kabwe. He later worked at Andre Masiye and Company Advocates, Barclays Bank and Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines.

6/6/2025,Article,Sport,'Genius' Yamal & all-time classic - why Spain are World Cup favourites,https://www.bbc.com//sport/football/articles/c9q0329d3xeo,"Lamine Yamal (centre) has scored six goals for Spain with one more game to come before he turns 18 Spain and France played out a Nations League semi-final game for the ages with a scoreline that looks like it belongs in a penalty shootout. The 5-4 win for Spain has everyone wondering if anyone can stop these attackers - although the less said about the defenders, the better. Spain, who play Portugal in Sunday's final, are looking for a third Uefa tournament success in a row having won the last Nations League and Euro 2024. And they are favourites for the World Cup coming up next summer, with France second on the list. Spain showed why they will be tough to stop after one of the most exciting international games in memory. A total of 40 shots, 17 on target, nine goals. Spain led 4-0 and 5-1 - and threatened to blow France away - before their rivals rallied. If only every match was like this. ""It was a crazy game,"" said Spain goalscorer Mikel Merino. ""Not the best game for the coaches - nobody wants to concede so many goals - but an amazing game for the fans."" His boss Luis de la Fuente seemed to actually disagree with him. ""I'm happy. I enjoy suffering! I don't understand sport without suffering,"" he said. ""When two great teams face off like today, it's normal every team makes the most of their moments."" Lamine Yamal, who turns 18 later this summer, scored twice for Spain to cement his credentials as a Ballon d'Or contender.  He is up to six goals for his country now, to add to 25 for club side Barcelona.  Yamal impressed more than France's Paris St-Germain stars - Ousmane Dembele and Desire Doue - who were hyped up pre-game after phenomenal club seasons. Les Bleus debutant Rayan Cherki helped spark France's fightback after coming off the bench to show why he is being linked with Liverpool and Manchester City. It would almost take too long to address everything that happened in the game. But here goes. Mikel Oyarzabal picked out Nico Williams to net Spain's opener, before also setting up Merino four minutes later. It was almost 3-0 but Dean Huijsen had a goal disallowed for offside after a sensational free-kick routine. ""That belongs in a musuem,"" said Prime Video summariser Karen Bardsley. After the break Yamal was fouled and scored the resulting penalty, with Williams finding Pedri shortly after for their fourth. Kylian Mbappe's penalty pulled one back, but Yamal bagged his second with a fine first touch and finish. ""It's hard to argue with the genius that you see before you,"" said Bardsley on seeing Yamal poke home his second. That was 5-1 but then France came back. Dembele hit the post, before debutant Cherki volleyed in from the edge of the box.  Dani Vivian turned a cross into his own net and then Randal Kolo Muani nodded in from Cherki's good ball. But they could not create another chance in the remaining two minutes of stoppage time to force the extra-time period every neutral wanted. After 75 minutes it looked as if the story was going to be about Spain blowing France away to cement their place as favourites to win everything going. They were the best side by some way at Euro 2024 and show no signs of slowing down. Wingers Yamal, who seems to improve with every game - which is actually to be expected at the age of 17 - and Williams were electric.  Midfielders Merino and Pedri were on the scoresheet. Oyarzabal had two assists to his name. Their oldest player was 28, and the team had an average age of 24. But there will be question marks about a defence that let in four goals - and a team who almost blew a 5-1 lead. Yamal said: ""When two great teams like this play, you sometimes see a lot of goals. They will make you suffer until the end but we went to the final despite the mistakes we made."" Unai Simon made six saves, so this was far from a story of an opponent who scored with every shot. ""That was a typical Spain performance,"" said Spanish journalist Guillem Balague. ""These players come out on the pitch with the feeling they can beat anyone. ""The interesting thing is they are doing it, winning and creating magic within a structure.  ""Spain have been playing in a way that represents the predominant model of our times. Not only are these players intelligent, creative but they are committed as well. They work so hard to get the ball back. ""Even though at the end Spain relaxed, when you do that you believe you belong to the right path.  ""You have special players all over the park and of course the feeling is more people are watching Spain because its really enjoyable and winning seems to be a habit."" Kylian Mbappe plays his club football in Spain for Real Madrid France's attackers were pretty decent. Even when they were getting whacked by Spain before the hour-mark, they were still having plenty of chances. They had more shots than Spain did in both halves - and more efforts on target in total. Mbappe, speaking to RTVE, said: ""We had some bursts of play we haven't had for a long time. But in just 10 minutes of the first half, we conceded two goals - and the same thing happened in the second half. ""We weren't consistent throughout the 90 minutes, but we did improve. It's not all negative."" PSG's two-goal Champions League final scorer Doue went close, team-mate and Ballon d'Or contender Dembele hit the post - and Mbappe had chances before scoring his penalty. But 21-year-old Lyon attacker Cherki had a big role after coming on. His sweet volley from the edge of the box was probably the best goal of the game - and his cross for Kolo Muani to make it 5-4 was inch-perfect. Again though, like Spain, it was the defending which was the issue. Juventus full-back Pierre Kalulu, making his debut on his 25th birthday, struggled. Clement Lenglet, winning his first cap since 2021, also faced problems too. ""I'm not here to point fingers but I have a backline who are used to working together,"" said boss Didier Deschamps. ""[This was] about finding another line who aren't used to playing together. I'm not going to give up on this defence. There were mitigating circumstances. But Spain have this capability to be very efficient. We were able to score goals too."" Sulaimon Adelekan: This Spain side is so good and young, they could rule world football for the next six years with Yamal, Pedri, Gavi and Nico Williams still yet to peak. They are dismantling and destroying France. Victor: With the way it's going, this Spanish team will easily win the next World Cup. There is simply no need traveling to USA. Robbie: Spain are the best team in the world at moment and it's not even close. Nick: Spain probably are currently the best team in the world, but a full-strength Germany (they were missing Rudiger, Musiala and Havertz yesterday) are close - they were the only team that can really claim they should have beaten Spain at the Euros with the chances they created - and Argentina are strong, too. I feel like France will be incredible at the next World Cup - they just need to work out what their best XI is, because they've arguably got too many good players! Copyright Â© 2025 BBC.

6/6/2025,Article,News,M&S hackers sent abuse and ransom demand directly to CEO,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/cr58pqjlnjlo,"The Marks & Spencer hackers sent an abuse-filled email directly to the retailer's boss gloating about what they had done and demanding payment, BBC News has learnt. The message to M&S CEO Stuart Machin - which was in broken English - was sent on the 23 April from the hacker group DragonForce using an employee email account. The email confirms for the first time that M&S has been hacked by the ransomware group – something that M&S has so far refused to acknowledge. ""We have marched the ways from China all the way to the UK and have mercilessly raped your company and encrypted all the servers,"" the hackers wrote. ""The dragon wants to speak to you so please head over to [our darknet website]."" The cyber attack has been hugely damaging for M&S, costing it an estimated £300m. More than six weeks on, it is still unable to take online orders The extortion email was shown to the BBC by a cyber-security expert. The message, which includes a racist term, was sent to the M&S CEO and seven other executives. As well as bragging about installing ransomware across the M&S IT system to render it useless, the hackers say they have stolen the private data of millions of customers. Nearly three weeks later customers were informed by the company that their data may have been stolen. The email was sent apparently using the account of an employee from the Indian IT giant Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) - which has provided IT services to M&S for over a decade. The Indian IT worker based in London has an M&S email address but is a paid TCS employee. It appears as though he himself was hacked in the attack. TCS has previously said it is investigating whether it was the gateway for the cyber-attack. The company has told the BBC that the email was not sent from its system and that it has nothing to do with the breach at M&S. M&S has declined to comment entirely. A darknet link shared in the extortion email connects to a portal for DragonForce victims to begin negotiating the ransom fee.  This is further indication that the email is authentic. Sharing the link – the hackers wrote: ""let's get the party started. Message us, we will make this fast and easy for us."" The criminals also appear to have details about the company's cyber-insurance policy too saying ""we know we can both help each other handsomely : ))"". The M&S CEO has refused to say if the company has paid a ransom to the hackers. DragonForce ended the email with an image of a dragon breathing fire. The email confirms for the first time the link between M&S's hack and the ongoing Co-op cyber-attack, which DragonForce have also claimed responsibility for. The two hacks - which began in late April - have wrought havoc on the two retailers. Some Co-op shelves were left bare for weeks, while M&S expects its operations to be disrupted until July. Although we now know that DragonForce is behind both, it is still not clear who the actual hackers are. DragonForce offers cyber-criminal affiliates various services on their darknet site in exchange for a 20% cut of any ransoms collected. Anyone can sign up and use their malicious software to scramble a victim's data or use their darknet website for their public extortion. Nothing has appeared on the criminal's darknet leak site about either Co-op or M&S but the hackers told the BBC last week that they were having IT issues of their own and would be posting information ""very soon."" Some researchers say DragonForce are based in Malaysia, while others say Russia. Their email to M&S implies that they are from China. Speculation has been mounting that a loose collective of young western hackers known as Scattered Spider might be the affiliates behind the hacks and also one on Harrods. Scattered Spider is not really a group in the normal sense of the word. It's more of a community which organises across sites like Discord, Telegram and forums – hence the description ""scattered"" which was given to them by cyber-security researchers at CrowdStrike. Some Scattered Spider hackers are known to be teenagers in the US and UK. The UK's National Crime Agency said in a BBC documentary about the retail hacks, that they are focusing investigations on the group. The BBC spoke to the Co-op hackers who declined to answer whether or not they were Scattered Spider. ""We won't answer that question"" is all they said. Two of them said they wanted to be known as ""Raymond Reddington"" and ""Dembe Zuma"" after characters from US crime thriller The Blacklist which involves a wanted criminal helping police take down other criminals on a blacklist. In a message to me, they boasted: ""We're putting UK retailers on the Blacklist."" There have been a series of smaller cyber-attacks on UK retailers since but none as impactful of disruptive as those on Co-op, M&S and Harrods. In the early stages of the M&S hack, unknown sources told cyber news site Bleeping Computer that evidence is pointing to Scattered Spider. The UK's national cyber-crime unit has confirmed to the BBC that the group is one of their key suspects. As for the hackers I spoke to on Telegram, they declined to answer whether or not they were Scattered Spider. ""We won't answer that question"" is all they said.

6/6/2025,Article,News,Arrests made in crackdown on finfluencers,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/crljw8n78l1o,"Hundreds of social media posts and websites operated by financial influencers are to be taken down following action by the City regulator. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said the move was part of an international crackdown, which has led to three arrests in the UK. So-called finfluencers can legitimately give financial tips on social media to large audiences, but sometimes this can stray into illegal financial advice. That can include a lack of authorisation and a failure to explain the risks - all packaged in promotional posts using the pretence of a lavish lifestyle. Regulators across across the UK, Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, Italy and the United Arab Emirates were involved in the crackdown during the week. The FCA said that, in the UK, it resulted in 650 requests for deletions from social media, and 50 take downs of websites operated by unauthorised finfluencers. It has also sent seven ""cease and desist"" letters, and invited four finfluencers for interview. Steve Smart, from the FCA, said: ""Our message to finfluencers is loud and clear. They must act responsibly and only promote financial products where they are authorised to do so - or face the consequences."" There are strict rules surrounding authorisation requirements for financial promotions in the UK. In some cases these are flouted, according to Beth Harris, head of financial crime at the FCA. ""The typical thing you may see is that somebody with a large social media presence will be on a beach in a sunny location with some super cars behind them, and wearing designer clothes and basically trying to sell a lifestyle,"" she told the BBC's Today programme.  ""Often they'll say they have super algorithms that means that they are a wonderful trader, so that then you can pay a fee, and then they will send you their trade."" However, to do this, she said, ""you must be authorised"". The FCA can request that social media platforms take down certain content, but the regulator has no powers to enforce them to do so. It called on these platforms to act on its requests quicker. The plea comes as the Treasury Committee has written to the technology company Meta - the owner of Facebook and Instagram - questioning its response to this kind of harmful content. The committee has asked Meta to set out to it why ""it has taken you on occasion up to six weeks to respond to a takedown request from the Financial Conduct Authority?"" A statement from Meta regarding the committee's letter said: ""There was an isolated incident in late 2024 which resulted in a delay in actioning a small number of reports from the FCA. This was rectified and all other relevant reports made by the FCA have been promptly processed."" On Tuesday, the MPs on Treasury Committee will quiz the chief executive of the FCA, Nikhil Rathi, on moves to bring more cryptoasset activity into regulation. On Friday, the regulator said it was proposing to lift the ban on offering crypto exchange traded notes to retail investors. This would allow individual investors to put money into products that track the value of crypto. The ban has been in place since 2021. Copyright 2025 BBC.

6/6/2025,Article,News,Measles holiday warning as cases rise in Europe,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/c706y4jr95lo,"Families travelling abroad this summer on holiday or to visit relatives are being warned about the rise in measles cases in Europe and other regions. Measles infections in Europe are at a 25-year high, while cases are also surging in countries such as Pakistan and Nigeria. Childhood vaccination rates in the UK that offer protection against measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) are still a long way below the recommended 95% uptake, with the lowest regional rates found in London at just over 73% vaccinated. The UK Health Security Agency is warning holidaymakers to make sure they are up to date with their vaccinations and stress that it is never too late to get vaccinated. The UKHSA's latest data on measles infections shows that an outbreak is continuing in England. Some 109 cases were confirmed in April and 86 so far in May. These cases have mostly been in unvaccinated children aged 10 years and under.  London has reported almost half of all cases in the past four weeks. Dr Vanessa Saliba, consultant epidemiologist at the UK Health Security Agency, says the rise in cases in England reflects what is happening abroad - and that's a concern as the summer holiday season gets going.  ""It's essential that everyone, particularly parents of young children, check all family members are up to date with two MMR doses, especially if you are travelling this summer for holidays or visiting family,"" Dr Saliba said. ""Measles cases are picking up again in England and outbreaks are happening in Europe and many countries with close links to the UK."" Measles spreads very easily and can be a nasty disease, leading to complications like ear and chest infections and inflammation of the brain with some children tragically ending up in hospital and suffering life-long consequences, Dr Saliba added. ""Nobody wants this for their child and it's not something you want to experience when away on holiday."" The decline in vaccination rates in the UK - particularly since the Covid pandemic - has been mirrored in other countries, especially in Europe.  The World Health Organization and UNICEF reported 127,350 measles cases in the European Region in 2024 - double the number of cases reported during the previous year and the highest number since 1997. This year has seen outbreaks in several other European countries popular with UK holidaymakers, including France, Italy, Spain and Germany. The WHO has also reported that Romania, Pakistan, India, Thailand, Indonesia and Nigeria currently have among the largest number of measles cases worldwide. There has been a big push to improve MMR vaccination rates across the UK, but Dr Amanda Doyle, national director for primary care and community services at NHS England, says there is still a lot of work to do. ""Too many babies and young children are still not protected against the diseases, which are contagious infections that spread very easily and can cause serious health problems.  ""MMR jabs are provided free as part of the NHS routine immunisation programme – and I would encourage all parents to act on invites or check vaccination records if they think they may have missed their child's vaccination."" Health experts say that anyone, whatever their age, who has not had two doses of the MMR vaccine can contact their GP surgery to book an appointment and that it is never too late to catch up. Measles is a highly contagious disease which is spread by coughs and sneezes. Common symptoms include: Small white spots may appear inside the mouth. A blotchy red or brown rash usually appears after a few days, typically on the face and behind the ears, before spreading to the rest of the body. It can be harder to see on brown and black skin. Measles normally clears up within seven to 10 days. However, it can lead to pneumonia, meningitis, blindness and seizures. Babies and young children, pregnant women and those with a weakened immune system are at increased risk. Getting it while pregnant can lead to stillbirth, miscarriage or babies being born small. Measles can be fatal, but this is rare. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.  The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites. Read about our approach to external linking.  "
6/6/2025,Article,News,Lost Turner oil painting found after 150 years,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/clyzp4r70m8o,"Turner's first ever exhibited oil painting is to be put up for auction after being lost for more 150 years. The Rising Squall, features a dramatic view of a former hot spring and spa in Bristol seen from east bank of the River Avon, before Clifton Suspension Bridge was built.  It made its way around the world and returned to the UK but was unknown as a Turner masterpiece for more than a century. His signature was revealed after the painting was cleaned last year. The artwork will be displayed in a public exhibition at Sotheby's, in London, between 28 June and 1 July before it is auctioned with an estimated value of up to £300,000. Julian Gascoigne, Sotheby's senior specialist, said: ""It's a fascinating and very instructive insight into his early style."" He added the painting represents Turner, famed as a watercolourist, as a teenage artist with ""ambition and skill"" in his early experiments an oil painter. The painting made its debut at the Royal Academy in 1793, three days after Turner's 18th birthday, before being bought by Reverend Robert Nixon, a customer of his father's barber shop. Reverend Nixon's son inherited the painting after his death, Mr Gascoigne said, adding it then fell ""into obscurity"" having last been exhibited in Tasmania, Australia, in 1858. The painting was done as part of Turner's first artistic tour when he was a teenager, where he travelled from London to the West Country. Mr Gascoigne said: ""Bristol would have been a very natural place for a young artist based in London to get to relatively easily and relatively cheaply, but would provide him with the sort of dramatic, sublime, picturesque landscape that he was seeking."" There was early mention of the painting in obituaries of Turner's life but for at least a century it was mistaken for a watercolour, meaning it was missing from the catalogue of his exhibited oil paintings. Up until the discovery last year during a restoration project, experts believed Turner's earliest exhibited oil was the Fisherman at Sea painting. Follow BBC Bristol on Facebook, X and Instagram.

6/6/2025,Article,Culture,Five works that reveal Banksy's hidden philosophy,https://www.bbc.com//culture/article/20250602-five-works-that-reveal-the-philosophy-of-banksy,"Banksy's new mural in Marseille is not the first image he has connected to the history of ideas. From Plato to Foucault, a Banksy expert reveals the philosophy behind these popular artworks. Which is the real you, the person you are now or the one you are capable of becoming? It's a heady question, to be sure, and not one you would expect to be confronted with while strolling down a street in Marseille in the waning days of May. Yet it's precisely the existential dilemma that Banksy, who once asserted ""being yourself is overrated"" – has surreptitiously installed in a cloistered stretch of the quiet Rue Félix Fregier, the site of a new work – the latest installment in the elusive artist's decades-long career as a provocative philosophical prankster.  For more than 30 years, Banksy has spiked many of his most iconic works – from his girl reaching hopelessly for a heart-shaped balloon to his masked rioter hurling a bouquet of flowers – with barbed allusions to Old Masters, from Michelangelo to Monet, Vermeer to Van Gogh. But there's more. Beneath his stealthy stencils lies a deep and deliberate engagement with the history of ideas as well, from classical Stoicism to postmodern deconstructionism. On 29 May, Banksy posted on Instagram a photo of his first new piece in more than five months, piquing the internet's interest by withholding its precise location. Discovered shortly thereafter in the major port city in southern France, Marseille, the mural is, at first glance, deceptively simple: a tall silhouette of a lighthouse spray-painted on to a blank beige urban wall; a rusting street bollard positioned nearby; and a painted shadow stretching across the pavement, joining the real-world object to its augmented, if two-dimensional, echo. Stencilled across the black lighthouse are the words: ""I want to be what you saw in me.""  Anyone keen to find a source for the ideas that inform Banksy's new work needs merely to flip open any history of philosophy to Plato's seminal allegory of the cave (from the Fourth-Century BC treatise The Republic), then flip the ancient metaphor on its head. In Plato's parable, prisoners chained inside a cave mistake shadows on the wall for reality, unaware of the truer forms that cast them outside. But here, Banksy, being Banksy, baits us by switching the set-up, reversing the relationship between essence and shadow. In Banksy's mural, the drab bollard casts not a diminished imitation of itself, but something far grander – a lighthouse, a symbol of illumination and guidance. Here, it's the silhouette, not reality, that's true. Banksy's inversion urges us to ask where reality really resides: in what is, or in what might be? His poignant phrase – ""I want to be what you saw in me"" – is alluringly elastic. Is this the bollard dreaming of being more than it appears? Or the shadow wishing to become light? Or is it all of us – Banksy included – struggling to live up to the better versions imagined by those who believe in us? The answer is surely yes to all of the above. And it's a yes too to the question: 'is this new work a lamp capable of shining light on further levels of meaning in Banksy?' What follows is a brief look back at some of the artist's best-known works and how they too are invigorated by, and often upend, many of the most important philosophical tenets – both social and intellectual – that underwrite who we are and who we might be. Banksy's new mural in Marseille is not the first to be accompanied by an affecting caption connecting the piece to the history of ideas. Among his most famous murals, Girl with Balloon, which portrays a child reaching towards a heart-shaped balloon drifting away from her, first appeared in 2002 in various locations in London, including on the South Bank, alongside the consoling assertion, ""there is always hope"". That conviction, which fuels the ceaseless striving for an ideal that is seemingly unobtainable in the mural (there's no way that balloon is coming back) rhymes richly with aspects of 19th-Century German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer's ideas concerning an unquenchable and irrational ""Will"" as a fundamental force that drives humanity. When, years later, Banksy mischievously concealed a remote-controlled shredder in the frame of a version of Girl with Balloon that came up for auction in 2018, and sensationally destroyed the work before the eyes of aghast auction-goers, he succeeded in upping the ante on Schopenhauer's belief in the futility of desire by boldly manifesting it himself. Where there's a will there's a fray. Banksy's famous mural of a masked man frozen forever in the instant before he unleashes not a brick or a bomb but a bouquet of flowers may seem, at first blush, to exemplify a pacifist's commitment to peaceful disobedience. The work appears to echo the precepts of Mahatma Gandhi's Satyagraha – a philosophy of non-violence that the Indian ethicist coined in 1919. Banksy's fully flexed figure, incongruously armed with a fistful of beauty, appears to epitomise Gandhi's insistence on wielding moral, not physical, strength. Doesn't it? Or has Banksy slyly subverted the philosophical assertion of pacifistic force by portraying his hero as an enraged rioter? The figure's anger has not been tempered by an appeal to the higher ideals of beauty and truth. Instead, those ideals have been weaponised by Banksy. Here, beauty and truth are not disarming, they are devastatingly explosive. Banksy's mural in Marseille employs a tried-and-true technique to ensure the work protrudes into the urban space in which we'll encounter it – elevating its philosophical potential from something flimsy and flat to something undeniably urgent. It's a tactic he used in a 2007 work that appeared near London's Oxford Street in which he depicts a boy atop a precariously high ladder, spray-painting the penetrating observation that we are ""One Nation Under CCTV"" in outlandishly outsized letters. Also portrayed within the mural is a uniformed officer and his obedient police dog who surveil the young vandal, while above them all an actual CCTV camera, presumably recording everything, juts out from the wall. The endless layers of surveillance-within-surveillance to which the work attests – as we watch the state watch an officer watch the boy – captures with uncanny precision the philosophical contours of the vast and all-encompassing prison machine in which the French poststructural philosopher Michel Foucault believed everyone in society was now irredeemably enmeshed. In Foucault's study Discipline and Punish: The Birth of the Prison, he resuscitates a blueprint for a prison proposed by the British utilitarian philosopher Jeremy Bentham at the end of the 18th Century, ""The Panopticon"" (meaning ""all seeing""), and uses it as a menacing metaphor for how no one can escape the perniciously penetrating eye of the panoptical state.  Banksy's witty 2014 work Mobile Lovers shines a chilling light on the state of contemporary relationships. The mural depicts a couple whose almost affectionate embrace is interrupted by the deeper fondness they have for the warm glow of their smartphones. The French existentialist philosopher Simone de Beauvoir, who died in 1986, may not have lived long enough to witness the emergence of mobiles. Yet her profoundly influential 1947 book The Ethics of Ambiguity – published exactly 60 years before the iPhone was launched in 2007 – with its exploration of the devastation that detachment and disconnection can wreak on the realisation of our truest selves, is profoundly proleptic of our modern predicament. To be free, de Beauvoir insisted, requires a deep attentiveness to each other. She believed in the authenticity of human encounters, without which life is a futile performance, dimly lit by disposable devices, rather than something profound and meaningful.  How Banksy Saved Art History by Kelly Grovier, published by Thames & Hudson, is out now. -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.

6/6/2025,Article,Travel,How WW2 changed the French diet,https://www.bbc.com//travel/article/20250605-how-world-war-two-changed-the-french-diet,"More than 80 years after D-Day, the recipes and ingredients introduced during France's wartime occupation are slowly making a comeback. By June 1940, German forces had blitzed through France in just six weeks, leading more than half of the country to be occupied. As a result, French staples like cheese, bread and meat were soon rationed, and by 1942 some citizens were living on as few as 1,110 calories per day. Even after World War Two ended in 1945, access to food in France would continue to be regulated by the government until 1949. Such austerity certainly had an impact on how the French ate during and just after the war. Yet, more than 80 years after Allied forces landed in Normandy to begin liberating the nation on D-Day (6 June 1944), few visitors realise that France's wartime occupation still echoes across the nation's culinary landscape. In the decades following WW2, the French abandoned the staples that had got them through the tough times of occupation; familiar ingredients like root vegetables and even hearty pain de campagne (country bread) were so eschewed they were nearly forgotten. But as wartime associations have slowly faded from memory, a bevy of younger chefs and tastemakers are reviving the foods that once kept the French alive. There aren't many French residents old enough to vividly recall life in wartime France today, and fewer still would deign to discuss it. Author Kitty Morse only discovered her great-grandparents' ""Occupation diary and recipe book"" after her own mother's death. Morse released them in 2022 in her book Bitter Sweet: A Wartime Journal and Heirloom Recipes from Occupied France. ""My mother never said any of this to me,"" she said. BBC.com's World's Table ""smashes the kitchen ceiling"" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future. Aline Pla was just nine years old in 1945 but, raised by small-town grocers in the south of France, she remembers more than others might. ""You were only allowed a few grams of bread a day,"" she recalled. ""Some [people] stopped smoking – especially those with kids. They preferred trading for food."" Such widespread lack gave rise to ersatz replacements: saccharine stood in for sugar; butter was supplanted by lard or margarine; and instead of coffee, people brewed roots or grains, like acorns, chickpeas or the barley Pla recalls villagers roasting at home. While many of these wartime brews faded from fashion, chicory coffee remained a staple, at least in northern France. Ricoré – a blend of chicory and instant coffee – has been on supermarket shelves since the 1950s. More recently, brands like Cherico are reimagining it for a new generation, marketing it as a climate-conscious, healthful alternative traditional coffee. According to Patrick Rambourg, French culinary historian and author of Histoire de la Cuisine et de la Gastronomie Françaises, if chicory never wholly disappeared in France, it's in large part thanks to its flavour. ""Chicory tastes good,"" he explained. ""It doesn't necessarily make you think of periods of austerity."" Other products did, however, such as swedes and Jerusalem artichokes, which WW2 historian Fabrice Grenard asserted ""were more reserved for animals before the war."" The French were nevertheless forced to rely heavily on them once potato rationing began in November 1940, and after the war, these vegetables became almost ""taboo"", according to Rambourg. ""My mother never cooked a swede in her life,"" added Morse. Two generations later, however, Jerusalem artichokes, in particular, have surged to near-omnipresence in Paris, from the trendy small plates at Belleville wine bar Paloma to the classic chalkboard menu at bistro Le Bon Georges. Alongside parsnips, turnips and swedes, they're often self-awarely called ""les legumes oubliés""(""the forgotten vegetables"") and, according to Léo Giorgis, chef-owner of L'Almanach Montmartre, French chefs have been remembering them for about 15 years.  ""Now you see Jerusalem artichokes everywhere, [as well as] swedes [and] golden turnips,"" he said. As a chef dedicated to seasonal produce, Giorgis finds their return inspiring, especially in winter. ""Without them, we're kind of stuck with cabbages and butternut squash."" According to Apollonia Poilâne, the third generation of her family to run the eponymous bakery Poilâne, founded in 1932, a similar shift took place with French bread. Before the war, she explained, white baguettes, which weren't subject to the same imposed prices as sourdough, surged to popularity on a marketplace rife with competition.  But in August 1940, bread was one of the first products to be rationed, and soon, white bread was supplanted by darker-crumbed iterations bulked out with bran, chestnut, potato or buckwheat. The sale of fresh bread was forbidden by law, which some say was implemented specifically to reduce bread's palatability. ""I never knew white bread!"" said Pla. When one went to eat at a friend's home during wartime, she recalled, ""You brought your bread – your bread ration. Your own piece of bread.""  Hunger for white bread surged post-war – so much so that while Poilâne's founder, Pierre Poilâne, persisted in producing the sourdoughs he so loved, his refusal to bake more modern loaves saw him ejected from bakery syndicates, according to his granddaughter, Apollonia. These days, however, the trend has come full circle: Baguette consumption fell 25% from 2015 to 2025, but the popularity of so-called ""special"" breads made with whole or heirloom grains is on the rise. ""It's not bad that we're getting back to breads that are a bit less white,"" said Pla. For Grenard, however, the most lasting impact the war left on French food culture was a no-waste mindset. ""What remains after the war is more of a state of mind than culinary practices,"" he said. Rambourg agreed: ""You know the value of food when you don't have any."" The French were forced to get creative with what they had. In France's south-eastern Ardèche department, Clément Faugier rebranded its sweetened chestnut paste as Génovitine, a name whose medical consonance made it easier to market as a fortifier and even prescribe. In the coastal Camargue region, local samphire suddenly stood in for green beans. Morse's great-grandfather foraged for wild mushrooms in the nearby Vosges mountains, and in cities, those with balconies planted their window boxes with carrots or leeks. Paris' public Jardin des Tuileries was even transformed into collective kitchen gardens. According to Rambourg, this subsistence mindset ""would affect the entire generation that lived through the war, and our parents, because they were the children of our grandparents, who knew the war."" More like this: • How French winemakers outwitted the Nazis • The top-secret meeting that helped win D-Day • The French cocktail born from a banned spirit As the need for these subsistence methods dissipated, French cuisine underwent another period of change. In 1963, the country welcomed its first Carrefour hypermarket, and large-scale supermarkets soon supplanted small shops. According to Grenard, this was partly due to ""suspicion"" following corruption during the German occupation, when some grocers inflated prices far past the norm, just because they could . ""At the end of the war, consumers held real rancour against small shopkeepers,"" said Grenard. ""In a supermarket, the prices are fixed.""  Fast-forward eight decades, and some locals, now motivated by climate change are turning back to small, local grocers, such as the locavore Terroir d’Avenir shops dotting Paris. Others are reaching into the nation's past to resuscitate techniques like canning, preserving and foraging that saved many French residents during the war, according to Grenard. ""The people that got by the best were the ones who had reserves."" Today, filling the larder with foraged food has become popular once again. In Kaysersberg, Alsace, chef Jérôme Jaegle of Alchémille puts this ancestral knowledge centre-stage by offering wild harvesting workshops culminating in a multi-course meal. And in Milly-la-Forêt, just outside Paris, François Thévenon highlights the foraging techniques he learned from his grandmother with classes teaching others how to seek out these edible plants themselves. ""After the war"", he explained, ""people wanted to reassure themselves that they wouldn't lack anything anymore."" They turned, he said, to overconsumption, specifically of meat, which even his foraging grandmother ate every day, at every meal. ""You often hear when you ask older folk why they no longer eat wild plants, that it's because they don't have to,"" Thévenon said, who forages for wild plants because he believes it's good for his health and that of the planet. According to Apollonia, the war didn't only change how France eats. ""It probably changed the way the world eats,"" she asserted. Today, the techniques and philosophies that helped the French survive are slowly coming back to life. -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.  For more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.   Copyright 2025 BBC.

6/6/2025,Article,Travel,Eight rare juices you can only try in the Amazon,https://www.bbc.com//travel/article/20250529-eight-rare-juices-you-can-only-try-in-the-amazon,"Far from smoothie bars and powdered sachets, these wild Amazonian juices are pulped just hours after picking – making them rich in flavour and cultural meaning. The Amazon is not only the world's largest and most biodiverse ecosystem – it's also one of the most delicious. Among the thousands of native species, around 220 trees are known to bear edible fruit, many of which never leave the jungle. Some are too delicate to export, while others are little known beyond the communities that have nurtured them for generations. But along the Amazon River and its tributaries – from Peru's misty highland jungle to the floodplains of northern Brazil – travellers can find market stalls and cafe counters brimming with thick, vibrant juices that capture the flavour of the forest. These are the fruits you're unlikely to find bottled or powdered at home, often pulped just hours after harvest, served chilled in the tropical heat and prized not only for their nutrients but for their rich textures and sharp tangs. Here are eight juices worth seeking out, whether for their bold flavours, cultural significance or the thrill of trying something new. On the eastern slopes of the Andes, where rivers cascade in dramatic waterfalls into the Amazon Basin, travellers will find the aguaje fruit of the Moriche palm. In the small Peruvian city of Tingo Maria, markets are piled high with silver trays of the armadillo-like fruit. Locals soak them in water for a day or two, before peeling the brown armour to reveal an intensely orange flesh. The pulp is soaked, mashed and transformed into aguajina – a thick and custardy drink that tastes like cross between pumpkin pie and flan. BBC.com's World's Table ""smashes the kitchen ceiling"" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future. Some locals say that the fruit contains oestrogen compounds and men should be careful of drinking too much of it, though there is little scientific evidence. ""The aguajina is very useful – for the bone, for the skin, for the complexion – especially for women,"" says Gianina Pujay, an aguajinera who sells the drink across from Tingo Maria's fruit market. In the same region, the cocona fruit, a tropical relative of the common tomato, yields a tangy juice that tastes like a pineapple-papaya hybrid with a thick, almost oily body.  ""Many Amazonian fruits are consumed in juice form because their pulp is acidic, fibrous or difficult to eat raw, like the cocona,"" explains Miluska Carrasco, a researcher and nutritionist at Peru's Instituto de Investigación Nutricional, ""It's also a practical way to use them quickly before they spoil."" Descending from the verdant slopes of the Andes into the Amazon Basin, the rivers slow down and transform into thoroughfares of commercial activity. On the banks of the Ucayali River is the river port city of Pucallpa, the furthest Peru's road system will take you into the centre of the Amazon. Here, where container barges, passenger ships and canoes all move goods around the forest, camu camu is a must-drink juice.  The small, tart, plum-like fruit tastes like a sour strawberry with a hint of peach, and is a favourite of local juice vendors. ""[It] has more vitamin C than oranges,"" says Carrasco, ""[as well as] other bioactive compounds."" Where a navel orange provides about 6mg of vitamin C per 100g, the camu camu contains more than 2,000mg for the same amount of flesh.  The season for camu camu is short, however, typically between January and March, so take advantage of the fresh juice when it's available. Locals also eat the little plums with salt; just spit out the seeds.  In the heart of Brazil's vast Amazonas state, 700 miles east of Pucallpa as the toucan flies (and at least a week or more on a river boat), tucumã palms provide an orange fruit that's only in season from February to August. During this time, it's often eaten for breakfast with cassava flour and is a key ingredient in the state's signature x-caboquinho sandwich, where slices are layered with salty coalho cheese and sweet chunks of fried plantains. To make juice from the notoriously fibrous tucumã, vendors use peelers, blenders and sieves to reduce shavings of the fruit to a pulp and then filter out the lightly nutty liquid. According to Francisco Falcão, a farmer in the community of Bom Jesus in the Tefé National Forest, ""people say that tucumã is good to eat and improves sight and skin"". Indeed, the fruit is rich in both manganese and calcium. Where kiwi, which is relatively high in calcium, contains around 30mg of calcium per 100g, tucumã has been measured to contain around four times as much. Also in the Tefé region, ""there's a palm tree that people eat the fruit of,"" says Falcão. ""Pupunha is a plant that we harvest starting in December and ending February."" Spanish-speaking parts of the Amazon know this oily palm fruit as pejibaye or pijuayo, and it is a key source of natural fats as well as vitamin B1 and vitamin E.   The pupunha grow in clusters of orange and red acorn-shaped fruit. They cannot be eaten raw, but once boiled they make a filling snack akin to an oily sweet potato. The boiled fruits also produce a creamy orange juice once fully pulped. In Peru, forest communities ferment the pulp into a lightly alcoholic drink called chicha or masato – especially during times of harvest.    In Manaus, capital of the Amazonas, reliable refrigeration means locals and visitors can enjoy fruits in various forms. The thick shell of the cupuaçu contains a collection of seeds surrounded by a fleshy white pulp. That pulp can be transformed into silky, tangy juice. But lately, locals have been incorporating its juice into ice cream. Indeed, the rest of Brazil is catching on, with ice cream parlours in Rio de Janeiro now offering the flavour too. More like this: • Spain's 'white gold' super-drink • A decadent avocado smoothie to break the Ramadan fast • The Caribbean's cooling, healthy elixir for summer Cupuaçu tastes like a creamy pineapple – surprising given that it's a close relative of cacao. ""It's the same genus as cacao and people make cupulate [as opposed to chocolate from it],"" says Daniel Tregidgo, a researcher at Brazil's Mamirauá Institute for Sustainable Development. ""When you go to the markets there are huge piles of cupuaçu seeds. I look at that and I say that's hipster chocolate right there."" Why haven’t we heard of cupulate yet? In Tregidgo's opinion, ""It's a matter of investment. If you take something from the middle of Amazon and you try to get it out into the global market without being exploitative, it is a bit tricky."" Bars produced from cupuaçu have the flavour of chocolate but retain some of their citrus piquancy. In the Amazon delta, jenipapo is known for its traditional use as a blue dye and a temporary tattoo ink. The fruit itself, which grows all along Brazil's coast in addition to the Amazon, has a yellowish pulp that's a great source of vitamin B1 and zinc. While jenipapo can be consumed as a fresh juice that tastes a bit like dried apricots, try ordering licor de jenipapo, an infused cachaça liqueur served in small bars and botecos. While açaí has become a global wellness trend, the version served in the Amazon bears little resemblance to the frozen bowls found abroad. What many travellers don't realise is that there are seven distinct açaí palm species. Locals distinguish between açaí-do-Pará, açaí-do-mato and juçara, depending on region. In Belém, for example, vendors use pneumatic presses to extract the berry's thick, purplish pulp – sold in clear bags and consumed straight out of bowls with spoons, as if a purple gazpacho. Outside of its natural range in Brazil, the rest of the country enjoys the pulp prepared in yogurts and ice creams.  -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.  For more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.  Copyright 2025 BBC.

6/6/2025,Article,Future,The abandoned US quest to control hurricanes,https://www.bbc.com//future/article/20250603-project-stormfury-the-us-quest-to-control-hurricanes,"An ambitious project to weaken or divert hurricanes generated decades of suspicion and disagreement. What did we learn – and will it ever be revived? As a grad student in the 1960s, Joe Golden flew on about a dozen of missions into the ""eyewall"" of a hurricane, where winds of 160mph (260km/h) battered the sides of his propeller-powered plane. ""You could think of it as a ring of thunderstorms that often tower over 40,000ft [12,200m],"" says Golden, who photographed hurricanes and gathered data on their development. ""And it can also have frequent lightning in it,"" he adds, matter-of-factly. ""So that's another hazard."" Crews on the ""hurricane hunting"" flights padded their planes' cabin and learned to never ignore orders to strap in when penetrating the wall. But meteorologist Hugh Willoughby recalls thrilling ""white-knuckle"" flights, including one when life rafts and safety equipment crashed against the ceiling when the plane began falling about 200ft (60m), its engine flaming out. ""This is something I dearly loved: get up at 2:00 in the morning, put on my flight suit, lace up my boots,"" says Willoughby. ""Go into the kids' room, pull the covers up over them, kiss them on the forehead, and go out and fly into a raging tempest."" Since the 1940s, pioneers like Willoughby and Golden have been embarking on daring flights into this most intense region of a hurricane to gather data that has expanded scientific knowledge about them and revealed how they develop their lethal force. But, for a brief window of a few decades, the US Department of Defense and weather services flew missions into the eyewall with an even more ambitious objective: to not only observe these towering storms but to change them. Between 1962 and 1983, under the name Project Stormfury, navy pilots flew missions that released a silver compound into ""the belt of maximum winds"", just beyond the wall, in the belief that this region was violent but unstable. If so, perhaps it could be disrupted, calming the storm's vicious force. Six decades after its first flights – and 42 years since it was cancelled – Stormfury veterans Golden and Willoughby remember a project that gave us vital knowledge that has helped to save lives. But along with this, US attempts to control storms have left behind a controversial legacy that has fueled distrust and conspiracy theories, with some unanswered questions that linger today. Both Golden and Willoughby recall that weather modification projects emerged at a time of enormous optimism following the end of World War Two, when there was a widespread perception that there was no limit to what science could achieve. In the background was the nuclear bomb, says Kristine Harper, professor of history and sciences at the University of Copenhagen. After the destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, there was expectation that constructive uses of atomic energy would follow, from nuclear power to ""atomic gardening"" that used radioactive substances to breed new mutant crops. In 1946, newspaper and radio stations speculated that nuclear weapons might soon safeguard us from acts of God, recounts Harper in her book Make It Rain, an account of the US government's attempts at weather control. One New York Times article asked whether atomic energy ""by its explosive force"" could divert hurricanes away from cities. ""You know, maybe we could destroy hurricanes with nuclear bombs?"" laughs Harper. (This is not a good idea, meteorologists have repeatedly clarified.) Early efforts to explore weather control were backed by veterans of the Manhattan Project, including John von Neumann and the so-called ""father of the H-bomb"" Edward Teller. But the most important breakthrough arrived, instead, inside a small, adapted freezer. At the research laboratory at US firm General Electric run by Nobel Prize-winning chemist Irving Langmuir, experiments had shown it might be possible to induce rain in clouds, by releasing substances  that would cause supercooled water in the clouds to crystallise into snowflakes.  To test this ""cloud seeding"" technology in the field, Langmuir's assistant dropped dry ice out of the window of a single-engine airplane into a cloud hanging over western Massachusetts in November 1946. Langmuir was watching through binoculars from the ground below as snow began to fall in autumn toward a mountain called Mount Greylock. ""This is history!"" he cried down the phone to reporters, according to Caesar's Last Breath: The Epic Story of the Air Around Us by Sam Kean. At a time when many dreamed they might soon ""be able to choose their weather much as they chose a radio station"", writes Harper, the era of weather control appeared to be startlingly close at hand.  Although little was known at the time about hurricane structure and behaviour, the US Navy and Army agreed to collaborate with Langmuir's lab on Project Cirrus, which aimed to understand if cloud seeding technology might be able to help extinguish hurricanes at birth, divert them off-course, or else weaken deadly tropical cyclones before they hit land. Data gathered by weather balloons and aircraft indicated that hurricane clouds might contain large quantities of supercooled water, like the cloud Langmuir had seeded. During the hurricane season of 1947, on October 13, he convinced a navy crew to drop 80kg (200lb) of dry ice into an ice crusher in the belly of a B-17 bomber, sprinkling powder into a hurricane crossing Florida. This would be the historic first attempt to use this technology to modify a tropical cyclone. Although the adapted World War Two bombers did not have the technology to precisely target areas of the hurricane, their mission was enough to encourage the project's directors. Flying in a B-17 half-a-mile behind the seeding plane, a US Navy meteorologist observed overcast clouds turned into snowfall, noting the hurricane appeared to undergo ""pronounced modification"", recounts Fixing The Sky by Jim Flemming. But in the days after, the unexpected happened. The hurricane that had been heading out harmlessly to sea, swerved from its course. Hitching westward, toward shore, it smashed the city of Savannah, Georgia, resulting in one recorded death and damage estimated at millions of dollars. Despite no firm evidence, Langmuir said he was ""99% sure"" the storm had changed course due to the seeding. Fears among the public and questions from meteorologists plagued Project Cirrus until it ended in 1952. But the US military maintained a strong interest in storm modification as their involvement in the Vietnam War escalated in the 1960s, says Harper. ""The Navy had a secret programme out at China Lake Naval Air Station [in California] where they were working on seeding techniques or weather-control techniques that were going to be used in Laos in Vietnam,"" she says. These classified missions, codenamed Operation Popeye, aimed to develop a ""weather weapon"" that could seed rain storms to wash out the Ho Chi Minh Trail, the North Vietnamese military supply line. For these efforts, says Harper, a civilian programme to research weather modification would provide the ""perfect cover"".  According to Stormfury's working hypothesis, by seeding the area just outside the eye wall with silver iodide, they could cause clouds to form a second eyewall, which in turn would compete with the inner eye wall. If they could make an eyewall to reform at a greater width, they expected that they would slow the hurricane's speed, Harper explains – like an ice skater extending their arms to slow their twirl. ""If they could reduce the wind speed by 10% or so, that could make a difference in the category of intensity at landfall,"" says Willoughby, who started out flying storm-monitoring missions in the Pacific for the US Navy during the early 1970s. If a 100mph (160 km/h) wind could be slowed to (80km/h), it would actually lose 75% of its force. Hurricane Esther would provide the crucial test for the theory. Emerging around the islands of Cabo Verde (Cape Verde) in September 1961, the storm was becoming more intense as it swept through the Atlantic, about 400 miles (640km) north of Puerto Rico. On 16 September, an aircraft belonging to the US Weather Bureau flew through Esther's eyewall and dropped eight canisters of silver iodide into the raging winds. On a radar instrument monitoring Esther, US Weather Bureau planes detected a weakening of the eyewall. Despite other checks showing no change, it was declared a success, the Stormfury era was officially launched. The 1947 Project Cirrus mission still loomed large, despite research indicating the hurricane had already begun to turn before the seeding flight. As a result, Stormfury was restricted by a stringent set of requirements for how and where hurricanes could be modified. What resulted was a polygon zone drawn on a map: a confined experimental area, over the open Atlantic far from the US – yet close enough to Cuba that Fidel Castro accused the US of trying to attack his communist regime. As a result of these restrictions, many storm seasons came and went during the 1960s, as Stormfury waited on call, frustrated. After another seeding mission in 1963, which produced mostly inconclusive results, Hurricane Betsy in 1965 appeared the perfect candidate, explains Golden, who joined Stormfury in 1964 and spent four decades at National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa). As the hurricane approached the Caribbean, Golden recalls Stormfury's leaders, the pioneering meteorologists Joanne and Robert Simpson, waiting on the line for Noaa's chief Robert White to give the go-ahead. ""We could only seed if the eye was within a prescribed area – and it was 50 miles [80km] outside the prescribed area,"" he says, so the crew stood down. Although a huge disappointment to the team, that turned out to be a stroke of luck, he adds, which avoided a repeat of Project Cirrus's controversy. ""Hurricane Betsy made a very strange loop and it actually tracked to the south-west and hit just south of Miami."" Stormfury's biggest mission would finally arrive in 1969. On 18 and 20 August, 13 aircraft were involved in five runs across Hurricane Debbie, including a Navy A-6 Intruder jet, which dropped 1,000 silver iodide canisters each day. After nearly a decade of false starts, the data they gathered was jaw-dropping: most encouragingly, they documented a second eye wall emerging after seeding flights, with weaker winds, matching the hypothesis. During the two seeding days, winds decreased by 31% and 15%. Stormfury director R Cecil Gentry concluded that there was less than a one-in-10 chance of this happening naturally and his paper in the journal Science found that the data suggested the storm had been successfully modified by the scientists. Debbie was not the springboard to greater success that many involved in the project hoped. The last seeding flight flew in 1971, dropping canisters into the ill-defined eyewall of Hurricane Ginger with no discernible effect. Later the same year the Navy pulled support. The Navy's exit was in part because they no longer needed to test it, says Harper: ""They were using the techniques in Vietnam and Laos – they didn't need to test them in the Atlantic anymore on hurricanes."" Figures revealed in the Pentagon Papers in 1974 showed a far less cautious use of  silver iodide and similar compounds in Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos, where Air Force and Navy planes dropped in a total of 47,409 canisters in 2,600 seeding missions. In total, Stormfury's seeding flights had dropped canisters of silver iodide into four hurricanes on eight different days. Data across these flights found that on four days, winds reduced, falling in wind-speed by between 10% or more. Other days, nothing happened, which was blamed on flights failing to hit targets or poorly chosen storms. With few candidate storms in the Atlantic, during the 1970s, the US attempted to strike deals with Australia and the Philippines to run further tests on storms in the Pacific Ocean, off their coastlines. ""The countries in the Pacific Rim just said, no,"" says Harper. ""Just: 'No. That's not going to happen.'"" Around the time of Debbie's apparent success, the scientific basis of the project began to crumble. Images appeared to show some hurricanes spontaneously developed multiple concentric eyewalls, a phenomenon that Willoughby personally observed while flying through tropical storms with the Navy. If this was the case, Debbie's results could be mere coincidence. At the same time, research increasingly questioned whether hurricanes contained the vast clouds of supercooled water that Stormfury believed could be seeded, instead finding ice, which would be unaffected by silver iodide. ""Probably [either] one would have carried the day in an objective scientific evaluation,"" says Willoughby. Although he had joined Stormfury with the intention of contributing to storm modification, being assigned to seeding crews, Willoughby never flew a seeding mission and found a project adrift. ""Frankly, to my mind, the experiment did not seem to be well-thought-out in those later days,"" he says. Writing the final evaluation of the project in 1985, Willougby concluded that despite the team's determined efforts, ""the expected results of seeding are often indistinguishable from naturally occurring intensity changes"".  To all involved, it was clear that Stormfury was never a normal meteorological study – instead, an experiment that began ""at the wrong end"", according to the Navy's project leader Pierre St Amand, quoted in Make it Rain. Because of the project's military value, and potential impact on civilian safety, Stormfury received millions of dollars in funding and support that most meteorological studies can only imagine. At the same time, hurricane science was still in its infancy, with not enough known to make accurate predictions about their interior structure and behaviour. ""There was a germ of science,"" Harper summarises. But it's a pretty safe bet Stormfury would've remained in the lab if it weren't for military interests, she adds. Nevertheless, the project delivered results that are still keeping us safe in other ways. ""The aircraft measurements taught us a lot about hurricane structure and behaviour,"" says Joe Golden. ""And those data helped to improve the models at the time."" The funding it generated for meteorology helped address these knowledge gaps.  Willoughby, who is currently a research professor at Florida International University, says that since the start of Stormfury, the 24-hour forecast for hurricane's path has vastly increased in accuracy, from an error of more 120 nautical miles (138 miles/222km) to around 50 nautical miles (58 miles/93km), and forecast of hurricane intensity have improved from vague guidance to predictions accurate to within 10 knots (12mph/19km/h). Data gathered by the observer planes are still being researched, and instruments developed by Stormfury provide more accurate ways for airplanes to track hurricanes. Two highly modified P3 airplanes that were purchased for Stormfury – known affectionately as Kermit and Miss Piggy – continue to be used, some 50 years on. For some, Stormfury is unfinished work. ""Stormfury was one of the most frustrating scientific experiments in my life,"" Golden says. ""In a nutshell, I think that Noaa gave up too soon."" Over the years, Golden has continued to make a case for government agencies to step up and show ambition to make hurricane modification a reality. Spurred by Hurricane Katrina in 2005, in which nearly 2,000 people died, Golden began working with the US Department of Homeland Security on ""Hamp"", the Hurricane Aerosol and Microphysics Program. ""It was also aimed at weakening hurricanes, but it had a whole different approach. Instead of silver iodide, we were going to use very tiny salt aerosols as the seeding agent,"" he says. ""Had the funding continued, we were going to do some field experiments – not on hurricanes initially, but just on cloud lines.""  ""The modeling results were very, very encouraging,"" he says, indicating that aerosols could not only diminish a hurricane's intensity but alter its course. ""That's very important: if you can steer a hurricane like Katrina away from New Orleans, think of all the lives and the property damage that you would have saved."" ""That had some very tantalising results but – yet again – the funding ran out,"" he says. Willoughby, meanwhile, feels Noaa was right to end research. ""It was a beguiling idea – what's not to like about making it rain in the desert or keeping typhoons and hurricanes from wrecking cities?"" he asks. ""But the science didn't work out."" For anyone with a theory of how to stop hurricanes, the hurdles are clear, says Willoughby. ""What you do is you come up with an idea, you'd have to do a tabletop experiment or a small-scale field trial, and then use that to simulate it in a numerical model."" Yet he doubts a solution will find a way to match the force of a tropical storm – even if we use nuclear weapons.  Stormfury was a humbling reality check, says Willoughby, pitting humans against the ""immense"" energy of a hurricane – estimated to be equivalent to a 10-megatonne nuclear bomb exploding every 20 minutes. ""Perhaps some day, somebody will come up with a way to weaken hurricanes artificially,"" he writes in an email. ""Wouldn't it be wonderful if we could do it."" --  If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.

6/8/2025,Article,News,Trump's intervention in LA is a political fight he is eager to have,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/c628vwq9z9zo,"On the campaign trail last year, Donald Trump promised that he was not going to tolerate left-wing lawlessness on American streets and would use the full force of his presidential powers in response. The protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) efforts in California on Saturday night gave him an opening to follow through on that promise.  Never mind that the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) said that the protests were largely peaceful, or that local authorities said they could handle the clashes that did turn violent. Trump administration officials said that immigration agents were being targeted and injured – and that local law enforcement had been too slow to respond. ""Waiting several hours for LAPD to show up - or them telling us that they're not going to back us up until they have an officer in a dangerous situation - is something that just isn't workable when you have violent protests going on,"" Homeland Security Secretary Kirsty Noem told CBS News on Sunday morning. The LAPD said it ""acted as swiftly as conditions safely allowed"" and began dispersing crowds within 55 minutes of receiving the call. Over California Governor Gavin Newsom's objection, Trump federalised the 2,000 California National Guard soldiers, and Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth warned that US Marines were also on ""high alert"" to deploy – which would mark a rare use of the active duty military on US soil. By Sunday morning, Trump was declaring victory and thanking the National Guard for restoring peace, even though the guard had yet to fully assemble. The speed with which Trump reacted suggests that this is a fight his administration is prepared for – and even eager to have.  The White House believes that law and order, and aggressive immigration enforcement, are winning issues for him.  His actions will thrill his core base of supporters and could sway political independents concerned about public safety. Noem, in her interview, said the Black Lives Matters protests of 2020 in Minnesota were allowed to spread unchecked – and that the new Trump administration was going to handle things differently. ""We're not going to let a repeat of 2020 happen,"" she said. Democrats, however, have said the administration's use of masked immigration officers with military gear to arrest civilians in restaurants and shops has been inflammatory, and that the president's eagerness to deploy trained soldiers was unwarranted. ""For the president to do this when it wasn't requested, breaking with generations of tradition, is only going to incite the situation and make things worse,"" said New Jersey Senator Cory Booker.  ""A lot of these peaceful protests are being generated because the president of the United States is sowing chaos and confusion by arresting people who are showing up for their immigration hearings, who are trying to abide by the law."" The US has a long tradition of summer protests, and it is only early June.  Five months into Trump's second term, these California demonstrations may be an isolated event – or the start of greater civil unrest in the days ahead. Copyright 2025 BBC.

6/8/2025,Article,News,Activists say Israeli troops have boarded aid ship,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/c5y264x3nnno,"Activists say Israeli troops have boarded a yacht trying to bring humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip, in defiance of an Israeli naval blockade. ""Connection has been lost"" on the Madleen, the Freedom Flotilla Coalition (FFC) campaign group said on the Telegram app. It posted a photo showing people in life jackets sitting with their hands up.  Appearing to confirm that the ship had been boarded, Israel's foreign ministry said the yacht was ""safely making its way to the shores of Israel"" and its passengers were ""expected to return to their home countries"".  Climate activist Greta Thunberg is among those aboard the vessel, which was reported to be off the Egyptain coast.  Israel says its blockade is necessary to prevent weapons from reaching Hamas militants in Gaza.  After reporting that the yacht had been boarded, the FFC posted short, pre-recorded videos of some of the activists, including Thunberg.  In the footage, activists say ""if you see this video, we have been intercepted and kidnapped"" by the Israeli military or forces supporting Israel.  The FFC earlier said the vessel, which left Italy's island of Sicily on Friday, was carrying humanitarian aid and had been ""prepared for the possibility of an Israeli attack"". Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz had warned that the yacht should turn back and that Israel would act against any attempt to breach the blockade. He wrote in a post on X on Sunday: ""I have instructed the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] to act to prevent the 'Madeleine' [sic] hate flotilla from reaching the shores of Gaza - and to take whatever measures are necessary to that end."" Katz says the purpose of Israel's blockade, which has been in place since 2007, is to ""prevent the transfer of weapons to Hamas"" and is essential to Israel's security as it seeks to destroy Hamas.  The FFC has argued that the sea blockade is illegal, characterising Katz's statement as an example of Israel threatening the unlawful use of force against civilians and ""attempting to justify that violence with smears"". ""We will not be intimidated. The world is watching,"" FFC press officer Hay Sha Wiya said. ""The Madleen is a civilian vessel, unarmed and sailing in international waters, carrying humanitarian aid and human rights defenders from across the globe... Israel has no right to obstruct our effort to reach Gaza."" The Madleen is carrying a symbolic quantity of aid, including rice and baby formula, the group said. Citizens of Brazil, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and Turkey are onboard. In 2010, Israeli commandos killed 10 people when they boarded Turkish ship Mavi Marmara that was leading an aid flotilla towards Gaza. Israel recently began to allow limited aid into Gaza after a three-month land blockade, prioritising distribution through the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which is backed by Israel and the US but widely condemned by humanitarian groups. The UN's human rights chief, Volker Türk, said last week Palestinians were being presented with the ""grimmest of choices: die from starvation or risk being killed while trying to access the meagre food that is being made available"". But in a post on X early on Monday, the Israeli foreign ministry said: ""While Greta and others attempted to stage a media provocation whose sole purpose was to gain publicity - and which included less than a single truckload of aid - more than 1,200 aid trucks have entered Gaza from Israel within the past two weeks, and in addition, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation has distributed close to 11 million meals directly to civilians in Gaza. ""There are ways to deliver aid to the Gaza Strip - they do not involve Instagram selfies."" It is almost 20 months since Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza in response to the unprecedented Hamas-led cross-border attack on Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. At least 54,880 people have been killed in Gaza since, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Copyright 2025 BBC.

6/8/2025,Article,News,Brit Awards to leave London for Manchester after 48 years,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/cdxk7l58xjzo,"Next year's Brit Awards are to be held in Manchester - the first time the ceremony has taken place outside London since the awards began in 1977. The ceremony will be held at the Co-op Live arena on Saturday 28 February. A two-year deal means that the 2027 ceremony, which will celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Brit Awards, will also be held at the same venue. It is the second major music ceremony to announce plans to leave London. Last month the BPI, which represents the British music industry and runs the Brit Awards, also revealed that this year's Mercury Prize will be held in Newcastle in September after 32 years in the capital. Dr Jo Twist, CEO of the BPI, told the BBC: ""We've had a fantastic history in London for nearly 50 years, and we just feel that now is the time to make a bold leap into other parts of the UK to the fans. ""Manchester has such a rich musical heritage and it has a fantastic ecosystem of support there on the ground, including lots of amazing grassroots venues."" Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham described the move as ""a massive coup"" for the area. Hailing the city's ""unparalleled music heritage,"" Burnham said Manchester would ""pull out all the stops"" to prove the BPI had made the right decision. The past 15 Brit Award ceremonies have taken place at London's O2 Arena. This year's awards were dominated by Charli XCX, who won five including best artist, album and song of the year. Back in 1977, when the awards started, they were called The British Record Industry Britannia Awards. As part of the celebrations for the Queen's Silver Jubilee, they gave prizes to the best music released during her reign. Best album went to Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band by The Beatles. Best single was a tie between Procul Harum's A Whiter Shade of Pale and Bohemian Rhapsody by Queen, who turned up to accept the award from host Michael Aspel. The ceremony was held at the Wembley Conference Centre, which was demolished in 2006 and turned into flats. The Brit Awards became an annual event in 1982, taking place at the Grosvenor House Hotel and other London venues including the Royal Albert Hall, the Dominion Theatre, Hammersmith Apollo, Alexandra Palace, Earls Court Exhibition Centre and London Arena. Co-op Live has already held a major music award ceremony, the MTV Europe Music Awards (EMAs), in November last year, which attracted the likes of Teddy Swims, Benson Boone and Shawn Mendes. Britain's biggest indoor venue originally made headlines when its opening was delayed three times due to a series of highly-publicised problems. These included part of a ventilation system falling from the ceiling, an event the boss of Co-op Live Tim Leiweke said could have been ""catastrophic"". Since then, the venue has held the only UK shows on The Eagles' farewell tour, celebrated its first anniversary with three Bruce Springsteen gigs, and last November Charli XCX opened her Brat World Tour there. Manchester has a serious Brit Awards pedigree. Take That, who formed in the city, have won eight Brit Awards. Their former member Robbie Williams holds the record for the most Brit Award wins, with 18 including five while in the band. Simply Red, Elbow and The 1975 have all been named best group. M People were best dance act in 1995 and The Chemical Brothers, who met at the University of Manchester, won the same award in 2000. Two years ago, Aitch was named best hip hop, grime or rap act and in his acceptance speech said: ""Not many people from my side of Manchester get the opportunity to stand up here and receive such an amazing gift or award."" New Order, The Stone Roses, Happy Mondays, The Bee Gees, 10CC, Johnny Marr, Ian Brown, Doves, James, Blossoms and Badly Drawn Boy have all been nominated for Brit Awards over the years, but none of those acts have ever won. The Smiths, one of the most influential indie bands of all time, were never nominated at the Brits. One interesting potential storyline for 2026 is that if the Brit Awards were to bring back the best live act category (last presented in 2013 to Coldplay) then a possible winner might be one of the biggest Manchester bands of all time. Oasis will start their reunion tour in Cardiff on 4 July. The thought of the Gallagher brother picking up a Brit in their hometown, is one that would certainly help bring in audiences. Twist has a twinkle in her eye when she says: ""Our categories are always under review, so we will be looking at that. We're very excited to be part of that whole buzz."" It is exactly 30 years since Oasis won the first of their six Brit Awards - British breakthrough act, beating fellow nominees Echobelly, Eternal, Portishead and PJ & Duncan. Copyright 2025 BBC.

6/8/2025,Article,News,Italy citizenship referendum: 'I was born here - but feel rejected',https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/c780yk3z2lyo,"Sonny Olumati was born in Rome and has lived in Italy all his life but the country he calls home does not recognise him as its own. To Italy, Sonny is Nigerian, like his passport, and the 39-year-old is only welcome as long as his latest residence permit. ""I've been born here. I will live here. I will die here,"" the dancer and activist tells me in what he calls ""macaroni"" Italian-English beneath the palm trees of a scruffy Roman park. ""But not having citizenship is like... being rejected from your country. And I don't think this is a feeling we should have"". That is why Sonny and others have been campaigning for a ""Yes"" vote in a national referendum on Sunday and Monday that proposes halving the time required to apply for Italian citizenship. Any children under 18 would automatically be naturalised along with their parents. Cutting the wait from 10 years to five would bring this country in line with most others in Europe and, proponents argue, improve integration. The referendum was initiated by a citizens' initiative and is supported by civil society groups. But for such a referendum to be valid, 50% of all voters in Italy have to turn up. Giorgia Meloni, the country's hard-right prime minister, has announced she will boycott the vote, declaring the citizenship law already ""excellent"" and ""very open"". Other parties allied to her are calling on Italians to go to the beach instead of the polling station. Sonny will not be taking part either. Without citizenship, he is not entitled to vote. The question of who gets to be Italian is a sensitive one. Large numbers of migrants and refugees arrive in the country each year helped across the Mediterranean from North Africa by smuggling gangs. Meloni's populist government has made a big deal about cutting the number of arrivals. But this referendum is aimed at those who have travelled legally for work to a country with a rapidly shrinking and ageing population. The aim is limited: to speed up the process for getting citizenship, not ease the strict criteria. ""Knowledge of the Italian language, not having criminal charges, continuous residence et cetera - all the various requirements remain the same,"" explains Carla Taibi of the liberal party More Europe, one of several backers of the referendum. The reform would affect long-term foreign residents already employed in Italy and their families: from those on factory production lines in the north to those caring for pensioners in plush Rome neighbourhoods. Up to 1.4 million people could qualify for citizenship immediately, with some estimates ranging higher. ""These people live in Italy, study and work and contribute. This is about changing the perception of them so they are not strangers anymore - but Italian,"" argues Taibi. The reform would also have practical implications. As a non-Italian, Sonny cannot apply for a public sector job, and even struggled to get a driving licence. When he was booked for hit reality TV show Fame Island last year, he ended up arriving two weeks late on set in Honduras because he had had so many problems getting the right paperwork. For a long time, Meloni ignored the referendum entirely. Italy's publicly owned media, run by a close Meloni ally, have also paid scant attention to the vote. There is no substantive ""No"" campaign, making it hard to have a balanced debate. But the real reason appears strategic. ""They don't want to raise awareness of the significance of the referendum,"" Professor Roberto D'Alimonte of Luiss University in Rome explains. ""That's rational, to make sure that the 50% threshold won't be reached."" The prime minister eventually announced she would turn up at a polling station ""to show respect for the ballot box"" - but refuse to cast a vote. ""When you disagree, you also have the option of abstaining,"" Meloni told a TV chat show this week, after critics accused her of disrespecting democracy. Italy's citizenship system was ""excellent"", she argued, already granting citizenship to more foreign nationals than most countries in Europe: 217,000 last year, according to the national statistics agency, Istat. But about 30,000 of those were Argentines with Italian ancestry on the other side of the world, unlikely even to visit. Meanwhile, Meloni's coalition partner, Roberto Vannacci of the far-right League, accused those behind the referendum of ""selling off our citizenship and erasing our identity"". I ask Sonny why he thinks his own application for citizenship has taken over two decades. ""It's racism,"" he replies immediately. At one point his file was lost completely, and he has now been told his case is ""pending"". ""We have ministers who talk about white supremacy - racial replacement of Italy,"" the activist recalls a 2023 comment by the agriculture minister from Meloni's own party.  ""They don't want black immigration and we know it. I was born here 39 years ago so I know what I say."" It is an accusation the prime minister has denied repeatedly.  Insaf Dimassi, 28, defines herself as ""Italian without citizenship"". ""Italy let me grow up and become the person I am today, so not being seen as a citizen is extremely painful and frustrating,"" she explains from the northern city of Bologna where she is studying for a PhD. Insaf's father travelled to Italy for work when she was a baby, and she and her mother then joined him. Her parents finally got Italian citizenship 20 days after Insaf turned 18. That meant she had to apply for herself from scratch, including proving a steady income. Insaf chose to study instead. ""I arrived here at nine months old, and maybe at 33 or 34 - if all goes well - I can finally be an Italian citizen,"" she says, exasperated. She remembers exactly when the significance of her ""outsider"" status hit home: it was when she was asked to run for election alongside a candidate for mayor in her hometown. When she shared the news with her parents, full of excitement, they had to remind her she was not Italian and was not eligible. ""They say it's a matter of meritocracy to be a citizen, that you have to earn it. But more than being myself, what do I have to demonstrate?"" Insaf wants to know. ""Not being allowed to vote, or be represented, is being invisible."" On the eve of the referendum, students in Rome wrote a call to the polls on the cobbles of a city square. ""Vote 'YES' on the 8th and 9th [of June],"" they spelled out in giant cardboard letters. With a government boycott and such meagre publicity, the chances of hitting the 50% turnout threshold seem slim. But Sonny argues that this vote is just the beginning. ""Even if they vote 'No', we will stay here - and think about the next step,"" he says. ""We have to start to talk about the place of our community in this country.""

6/8/2025,Article,News,'My boyfriend is 5ft 6in but it doesn't matter' - Tinder's height filter divides daters,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/c98prk6ljdyo,"Joe is somewhat shorter than the average American man, at 5ft 6in (1.67m) - but when Ashley came across his Tinder profile last year, the last thing she was thinking about was Joe's height. ""We were talking about our hobbies and passions,"" Ashley says, ""not superficial things."" News that the dating app where Ashley and Joe found love is trialling a new feature - allowing some premium users to filter potential matches according to their height - was met with mixed reactions earlier this week. While daters like Ashley worry it might stifle possible connections, others say the feature might actually help shorter men find a match. Tinder's trial is running in ""limited"" parts of the world, excluding the UK, with the feature only available to those who pay for its two highest subscription tiers. Tinder has not told the BBC which countries it is being trialled in. It works by informing the app's matching algorithm based on a user's stated preference, rather than filtering out certain users altogether. But online reaction to its launch has ranged from amusement to outrage. ""Tinder just declared war on short kings,"" wrote one social media user, while another said they'd be ""using the Tinder height filter to filter out all men taller than 5ft 9in"". Another commented: ""I don't care what Tinder says - short kings are elite."" Ashley, from Wisconsin, says she understands why height can be a deal-breaker for some daters - but that wasn't the case for her. ""I've heard people talk: 'I can't wear heels or my partner will look shorter,'"" the 24-year-old says, ""but that's never mattered to me"". Joe is ""just such an amazing person"", she says, it wouldn't matter to her ""if he was six feet tall or five feet tall"". Using a height filter might actually have prevented her and Joe from ever meeting, she adds - and she reckons others could be missing out too. Joe, meanwhile, says Tinder's height filtering feature could actually make dating harder for shorter men. ""Limiting yourself to physical things about someone will lessen your opportunities and chances of finding a partner,"" he says. ""Height shouldn't matter when you're looking for forever."" The 27-year-old says his own dating experience hadn't ""all been so bad"" and that his matches had judged him based on his personality, rather than his height. But he thinks the new Tinder filter might affect other users' chances of meaningful connections. Tinder is not breaking new ground here - seasoned swipers will be familiar with various kinds of filter, which are now common features of dating apps including in the UK. Hinge, a key Tinder competitor, already allows paying users to filter matches according to their height. Other filters include education level, religion, and checking whether potential matches smoke, drink or take drugs. Bumble allows premium users to avoid matches with certain star signs, while paying Grindr users can filter by body type. But as the world's largest dating app, Tinder's experiment with height filtering still has huge significance, and has sparked discussion in Britain too. At 5ft 9in, Matt Heal, from Manchester, says he feels jaded about the online dating scene.  Matt's around average height for a man in the UK, but says some daters' preferences for taller men have disadvantaged him on the apps.  ""As someone who is neither very tall nor financially well off, I have definitely felt desensitised about dating [using apps],"" he says. The 28-year-old thinks it's understandable that apps like Tinder try to optimise their matching algorithms, though. ""People have preferences based on all sorts of things,"" Matt says, adding these features help people ""see others they are interested in, rather than swiping for hours on people you don't consider compatible"". However, he thinks daters shouldn't be too rigid about what they're looking for. ""If you were into people who are over six feet, would you really not date someone who's 5ft 11in"" - if they were good looking and had similar interests?"" Matt feels it's easier for men his height to meet people offline, explaining that meeting someone in person, through mutual friends, for example, can mean a less prescriptive approach. But Beth McColl, 31, thinks the Tinder height filter may offer shorter men some reassurance. The London-based writer and podcaster says it could help people avoid ""women who only want to date really tall men"".  Whether or not women will actually use this feature, Beth is uncertain. ""Women typically don't have a problem with dating a shorter man,"" Beth says, ""but they do, maybe, have a problem with dating a shorter man who is really hung up on it."" Aside from the filters, Beth believes the real problem of modern dating lies with the dating apps themselves. ""It encourages us to treat dating like picking something from the menu,"" she says, adding, ""there's nothing in being a little bit taller that will make that man a better partner - but I think we've tricked ourselves into thinking that there's truth in that."" As to whether the Tinder move will prove popular with users on a mass scale - that remains to be seen. ""Features like this capitalise on a well-known preference - some women desire taller partners,"" says Lara Besbrode, managing director at MatchMaker UK. ""They don't address the deeper issues at the heart of online dating fatigue."" But, she says, attraction is ""not static"" and can evolve over time. ""A man who is 5ft 7in (1.7m), but confident, kind, and emotionally attuned can be far more attractive than someone who ticks the 6ft (1.8m) box but lacks substance,"" Lara says. Tinder told the BBC its new filter demonstrates it is ""building with urgency, clarity, and focus"" and that it is ""part of a broader effort to help people connect more intentionally"" on the app. A spokesperson said: ""Not every test becomes a permanent feature, but every test helps us learn how we can deliver smarter, more relevant experiences and push the category forward."" And that fleeting moment when stumbling across each other's profiles on a dating app can be vital, as Ashley and Joe know. Ashley worries that people who use Tinder's new filter ""might be cutting themselves off from people who're a potential match for them, rather than someone who's their preferred height"". But for now her swiping days are over, and her relationship with Joe is blossoming. He's ""phenomenal"", Ashley says, ""super sweet"". Copyright 2025 BBC.

6/8/2025,Article,News,Israel warns it will stop aid yacht heading for Gaza,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/c0r1dvlkrxgo,"Israel has warned its military will ""take whatever measures are necessary"" to prevent a boat carrying pro-Palestinian activists and humanitarian aid reaching Gaza.  The Madleen yacht is 160 nautical miles from the Gaza Strip and is attempting to challenge Israel's sea blockade around the territory.  Defence Minister Israel Katz said the 12-strong crew, which includes climate protester Greta Thunberg, should turn back and that Israel will act against any attempt to breach the blockade. The Freedom Flotilla Coalition (FFC) said the vessel, which departed Sicily on Friday, was carrying humanitarian aid and was ""prepared for the possibility of an Israeli attack"".  Katz said the purpose of Israel's blockade, which has been in place since 2007, was to ""prevent the transfer of weapons to Hamas"" and was essential to Israel's security as it seeks to destroy the Palestinian armed group Hamas.  He warned in a post on X on Sunday: ""I have instructed the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] to act to prevent the 'Madeleine' [sic] hate flotilla from reaching the shores of Gaza - and to take whatever measures are necessary to that end."" Addressing the crew directly, he added: ""To the antisemitic Greta and her fellow Hamas propaganda spokespeople, I say clearly: You should turn back - because you will not reach Gaza. ""Israel will act against any attempt to break the blockade or assist terrorist organisations – at sea, in the air, and on land."" The FFC argues the sea blockade is illegal, and characterised the minister's statement as an example of Israel threatening the unlawful use of force against civilians and ""attempting to justify that violence with smears"".  ""We will not be intimidated. The world is watching,"" FFC press officer Hay Sha Wiya said.  ""The Madleen is a civilian vessel, unarmed and sailing in international waters, carrying humanitarian aid and human rights defenders from across the globe... Israel has no right to obstruct our effort to reach Gaza."" The group added that the vessel had earlier experienced temporary signal jamming, causing its location to appear near Jordan. The Madleen is carrying a symbolic quantity of aid, including rice and baby formula, the group said.  People from Brazil, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and Turkey are onboard. Israeli media say its navy is expected to block the boat before it reaches Gaza.  ""We will calmly take control of the ship, bring them to Israel, and deport them abroad that same night,"" an Israeli official told the Jerusalem Post.  In 2010, Israeli commandos killed 10 people when they boarded Turkish ship Mavi Marmara that was leading an aid flotilla towards Gaza.  Israel recently began to allow limited aid into Gaza after a three-month land blockade, prioritising distribution through the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), which is backed by Israel and the US but widely condemned by humanitarian groups. The UN's human rights chief Volker Türk said last week Palestinians were being presented with the ""grimmest of choices: die from starvation or risk being killed while trying to access the meagre food that is being made available"". It is almost 20 months since Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza in response to an unprecedented Hamas-led cross-border attack on Israel, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. At least 54,880 people have been killed in Gaza since, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Get our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

6/8/2025,Article,Sport,Sinner and Alcaraz thriller proves rivalry here to stay,https://www.bbc.com//sport/tennis/articles/ckgr4y2nz94o,"Sunday's title decider was the first French Open men's final between two players aged 23 or under in more than three decades A first major final between Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner, the two best players in the world, always promised to deliver. But even the most optimistic could not have anticipated it would reach the heights it did during a breathtaking five hours and 29 minutes. The two generational talents played out an instant classic at Roland Garros, in which Spain's Alcaraz recovered from two sets down - and saved three championship points - to retain his French Open title after a fifth set match tie-break. Alcaraz is only the third man to win a major final after saving a championship point since the Open era began in 1968. It was a fifth major triumph for Alcaraz, 22, who has now shared the sport's past six major titles with Italy's world number one Sinner, 23. Sunday's blockbuster, which broke the record for the longest French Open final in history, was the first Grand Slam men's final to feature two players born in the 2000s. If any doubt remained, this was confirmation of the dawn of a new era in men's tennis. The 2025 French Open final surpassed the four-hour and 47-minute 1982 showpiece as the longest in the tournament's history For more than two decades the men's game was dominated by Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer. But Djokovic, the only remaining active member of the trio, admitted he could have played his last French Open after his latest bid for a standalone record 25th Grand Slam title was ended by Sinner in the semi-finals. As the excitement surrounding Alcaraz and Sinner's rivalry entered the stratosphere in Paris on Sunday, the question of who could rise up and fill the void at the end of the 'Big Three' era has been answered. Seven-time major winner Mats Wilander, who won the previous longest Roland Garros final in 1982, said on TNT Sports: ""Federer and Nadal played a couple of good finals, but nothing comes close to this. ""I thought 'this is not possible - they're playing at a pace that is not human.' ""These are two of the best athletes the human race can put forward and they happen to be tennis players. I'm not speechless often, but what a wonderful day."" This was the first meeting in a major final between two familiar foes who have become the standout performers on the ATP Tour. Italy's Sinner, who served a three-month doping suspension between February and May, has shown remarkable consistency over the past 20 months, losing just 10 of 121 matches since the Beijing Open in September 2023. But half of those defeats have come in his past five meetings with Alcaraz. In fact, Sinner has lost just three of his past 50 matches - all to the Spaniard. ""I think every rivalry is different,"" said Sinner. ""Back in the days, they played different tennis. Now it's very physical, but you cannot compare.  ""I was lucky enough to play against Novak and Rafa. Beating these guys, it takes a lot. ""I have the same feeling with Carlos and some other players. It's very special. I'm happy to be part of this."" Alcaraz, who will begin his Wimbledon title defence in just three weeks, now leads the head-to-head with Sinner 8-4. In becoming the first man to win his first five Grand Slam singles finals in the Open era, Alcaraz ended Sinner's perfect record in major finals and his pursuit of a third-straight slam. ""Every match I'm playing against him is important,"" Alcaraz said. ""This is the first match in a Grand Slam final. Hopefully not the last because every time we face each other, we raise our level to the top.  ""If you want to win Grand Slams, you have to beat the best tennis players in the world."" With seven of the past eight slams going to Alcaraz and Sinner - a streak of dominance punctuated only by Novak Djokovic's 24th major title at the 2023 US Open - it remains to be seen if any other players can challenge the newly established status quo. French newspaper L'Equipe's front page on Monday read: 'Five hours 29 minutes of legend' Alcaraz emulated his childhood hero Rafael Nadal - a record 14-time champion at Roland Garros - by winning his fifth major at the exact same age of 22 years, one month and three days. Sinner, meanwhile, is the youngest man to reach three consecutive Grand Slam singles finals since 14-time major winner Pete Sampras in 1994. Such statistics offer a strong indication of the trajectory they both find themselves on. So, where does their rivalry go from here?  The pair both have titles to defend at the two remaining slams in 2025 - Alcaraz at Wimbledon and Sinner at the US Open. Alcaraz, who leads Sinner 20-19 in career titles, has reduced Sinner's lead at the top of the world rankings to 2,030 points. But the reigning champion has 2,000 points to defend at Wimbledon, compared to just 400 for Sinner after his quarter-final exit last year. ""I'm sure he will learn from this match and come back stronger next time we face each other,"" Alcaraz added. ""I'm sure he's going to do his homework. I'm going to try to learn how I can be better [and] tactically hurt his game.  ""I'm not going to beat him forever, that's obvious. So I have to keep learning from the matches I play against him.""

6/8/2025,Article,News,Trump-Musk row heightens fears over Nasa budget cuts,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/c87jq0djw00o,"The row between US President Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk over a major spending bill has exacerbated uncertainty over the future of Nasa's budget, which was already facing deep cuts. The White House had requested huge cuts to the space agency's budget, which would see funding for science projects cut by nearly a half. Now the president has threatened to withdraw federal contracts with Musk's company, Space X, further jeopardising the US space programme. Nasa relies on the firm's Falcon 9 rocket fleet to resupply the International Space Station with crew and supplies. The space agency also expects to use its Starship rocket to send astronauts to the Moon and eventually to Mars once it has been developed. Dr Simeon Barber, a space scientist at the Open University, said that the uncertainty was having a ""chilling impact"" on the human space programme. ""The astonishing exchanges, snap decisions and U-turns we've witnessed in the last week undermine the very foundations that we build our ambitions on. ""Space science and exploration relies upon long term planning and cooperation between government, companies and academic institutions."" Even before the feud between Trump and Musk, there was concern about the proposed cuts. Forty science missions, which are in development or in space already, are in line to be stood down. All sectors have been earmarked for savings, apart from an effort to send astronauts to Mars, which has received a $100m (£74m) boost. According to Casey Dreier, chief of space policy for the Pasadena-based Planetary Society, which promotes space exploration, the potential cuts represent ""the biggest crisis ever to face the US space programme"". Nasa has published details of how it plans to make the cuts requested by the White House in its budget request to Congress, proposing a reduction by nearly a quarter. The agency says the plan ""aligns [its] science and technology portfolios to missions essential for the exploration of the Moon and Mars"". Dr Adam Baker, a space analyst at Cranfield University, told BBC News that if these proposals are approved by Congress, it would fundamentally shift the agency's focus. ""President Trump is repurposing Nasa for two things: to land astronauts on the Moon before the Chinese and to have astronauts plant a US flag on Mars. Everything else is secondary."" Those who back the proposals say the White House's budget has given Nasa a clear purpose, for the first time since the days of the Apollo Moon landings of the 1960s and 70s, when the aim was to beat the Soviet Union to the Moon.  Nasa's critics say that, since then, the space agency has become a bloated, unfocussed bureaucracy which routinely goes massively over budget in its space missions and wastes taxpayer's money.  One of the most egregious examples of this is Nasa's new rocket for its plans to return American astronauts to the Moon, the Space Launch System (SLS). Its development has been delayed, and costs have spiralled such that it costs $4.1bn (£3.3bn) for each and every launch.  By contrast, SpaceX's equivalent rocket system, Starship, is estimated to cost around $100m (£80m) per launch because it is designed to be reusable. Jeff Bezos's Blue Origin space company promises similar savings for its proposed New Glenn rocket. To no one's surprise, SLS will be phased out under the White House proposals, in the hope that Starship and New Glenn can take its place. But the past three development launches of Starship have been unsuccessful, and Blue Origin has only recently begun to test its Moon rocket. ""The worry is that Nasa may be jumping out of the frying pan, into the fire,"" says Dr Barber. ""The development of these alternatives to SLS is being bankrolled by Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos.  ""If they lose their appetite for this endeavor and SpaceX or Blue Origin say they need more money to develop their systems, Congress will have to give it to them."" Of greater concern, says Dr Barber, is the potential loss of 40 missions to explore other planets and to monitor the impact of climate change on Earth from space, many of which involve collaborations with international partners. ""I think it is very sad that what has taken so long to build can be knocked down with a wrecking ball so quickly with no plan to rebuild it afterwards."" The projects facing the axe include dozens of planetary missions already in space for which most of the development and launch costs have already been paid for, with relatively small savings proposed on their operating costs. Also under threat are two collaborations with the European Space Agency: an ambitious plan to bring martian rocks collected by Nasa's Perseverance rover back to Earth and a mission to send Europe's Rosalind Franklin rover to the red planet to search for signs of past life. Prof Sir Martin Sweeting, head of the UK space firm Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd and co-author of a Royal Society report on the future of space, says that while the development was ""unwelcome"", there may be an upside for Europe as it takes greater responsibility for its own space exploration programme. ""Maybe we have been too reliant on Nasa [as] the big player to carry a lot of the emphasis in space,"" he told BBC News. ""It is an opportunity to think about how Europe wants to get a better balance in its space activities."" But there is much more downside for Europe in the short term. As well as the return of Mars samples and its rover, the ESA risks reduced access to the International Space Station if it is wound down, and the budget cuts cancel Nasa's extensive contributions to its successor, the Lunar Gateway, a multinational space station planned for orbit around the Moon. In its recently published strategy the ESA stated it ""will be seeking to build a more autonomous space capability, and to continue being a reliable, strong and desirable partner with space agencies from around the globe"", with the implication that it would do so with or without Nasa. Also facing cuts are numerous current and proposed Earth Observation programmes, according to Dr Baker. ""These Earth Observation programmes are our canary in the coal mine,"" he told BBC News. ""Our ability to predict the impact of climate change and mitigate against it could be drastically reduced. If we turn off this early warning system it is a frightening prospect."" The budget proposals have yet to be approved by Congress. The Planetary Society's Casey Dreier has told BBC News that many Republicans have told lobbyists privately that they are prepared to vote against the cuts. But, Mr Dreier worries that there is a strong possibility that political gridlock might mean that no budget is agreed.  It is likely that the reduced White House budget would be put in place as an interim measure, which then could not easily be reversed, because once space missions are turned off it is hard, if not impossible, to start them up again.

6/8/2025,Article,News,"It's the Race Across The World finale, and Love Island is back: What's coming up this week",https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/c93yx110neyo,"This week, it's the Race Across the World finale on BBC One, with the competitors battling to reach the finish line first. But that's not all the next seven days have in store. A fresh batch of singletons will be heading into the Love Island villa, it's the finale of I Kissed A Boy, Louis Theroux will be speaking to Ed Sheeran on his podcast, gaming fans have MindsEye to look forward to, and Rebel Wilson and Jason Isaacs are starring in new pop musical Juliet & Romeo. Read on for what's coming up this week... Another frenetic Race Across the World comes to an end on Wednesday. For anyone who hasn't seen the Bafta-winning BBC One show, it features a number of duos racing around the globe for a £20,000 prize. This year's pairs have been tasked with travelling around 14,000km - starting at the Great Wall of China and taking in the sights across Nepal and India. The scenery has been breath-taking, but for me, this show is as much about its contestants as the race and travelling. Everyone taking part has a story to tell, and they are always incredibly relatable - from bickering teenage sweethearts Fin and Sioned, to mother and son Caroline and Tom. This year's lineup also included sisters Elizabeth and Letitia, former married couple Yin and Gaz, and brothers Brian and Melvyn. Love Island is back, and if you're a fan of the show, you'll be getting set for another summer of fun, flirtation and plenty of drama. The latest season of the reality dating show starts on ITV2 and ITVX on Monday, a decade after it first hit our screens. This year's line-up includes a motivational speaker, a gold trader and a landscape gardener. However, one Love Islander's journey has ended before the new series has even started. Kyle Ashman, 23, was due to enter the villa but was axed after The Sun newspaper revealed he had been arrested over a fight at a funeral earlier this year. In an Instagram post Kyle, who was released by police without further action, said he was ""innocent"". After that rocky start, ITV's bosses will be hoping for smoother sailing over the coming weeks - and also to continue the viewing boost that last year's series enjoyed. Tonight, it's the series 2 finale of the UK's first ever gay dating show, I Kissed a Boy, on BBC Three. As the name might suggest, the format sees 10 singles matched up, and introduced for the first time - with a kiss to test out their chemistry. Over the past month, we've seen budding romance, wandering eyes and lots of drama in the Masseria - all overseen by Dannii Minogue in her role as Cupid. One of the remaining contestants, Jack S, says there is more drama in this last episode ""than there has been all series"", while another, Ruben, says you should ""expect the unexpected"". If you miss the grand finale, you can catch up on the whole series on BBC iPlayer. By Guy Lambert, culture reporter Ed Sheeran blew fans away when he made a surprise appearance at Radio 1's Big Weekend in Liverpool last month. Just days later he that was caught off guard, when he took a tumble on stage in front of 70,000 people, kicking off his European tour in Madrid. Ed's 2025 Mathematics Tour will see him play his biggest tunes in venues across 13 European countries, as well as tracks from his upcoming album Play, which is released in September. On Tuesday, he's making a safer appearance on Louis Theroux's podcast, which will be available on Spotify. I am told that the conversation will be a journey through his career, from the challenges he faced breaking into the industry, to performing on the biggest stages like Glastonbury in 2017. By Tom Richardson, Newsbeat reporter If you know games, you know the name. Leslie Benzies is hailed as one of the key minds behind the success of the record-breaking Grand Theft Auto series. After quitting developer Rockstar Games in 2016, he launched his own studio, Build A Rocket Boy (BARB). So you might expect a buzz around MindsEye, BARB's debut effort, releasing on PS5, Xbox and PC from Tuesday. On first glance the single-player game has big GTA vibes with car chases, shootouts and cinematic cut-scenes, but its makers say it's also the start of an ambitious ""multi-narrative universe"". However, the run-up to its release has been dampened by some less-than-enthusiastic previews calling out issues and airing concerns over its quality. BARB vowed to fix these before launch day, but it remains to be seen if this is a narrative it can turn in its favour. By Danny Fullbrook, culture reporter If you've ever wished Romeo & Juliet swapped Shakespearean verse for pop anthems, then Rebel Wilson's latest film might be your perfect match Juliet & Romeo is the first part in a planned pop musical trilogy, hitting cinemas for one night only on 11 June. Filmed on location in fair Verona the film stars Clara Rugaard (Black Mirror) and Jamie Ward (His Dark Materials) as the star-crossed lovers. The supporting players includes Jason Isaacs, Rupert Everett and Sir Derek Jacobi. Wilson said she was interested in playing Juliet's mother, Lady Capulet, as it was a chance to play against type. Critics have seen it a little differently. A one star review from The Washington Post called it as ""a very special kind of hell"". However Maggie Lovitt at Collider was a bit kinder when she said: ""Juliet & Romeo isn't necessarily a good film, but it is a very fun film."" Copyright 2025 BBC.

6/8/2025,Article,News,Doctors trialling 'poo pills' to flush out dangerous superbugs,https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/clyge290l4xo,"UK doctors are attempting to clear dangerous superbug infections using ""poo pills"" containing freeze-dried faeces. The stool samples come from healthy donors and are packed with good bacteria. Early data suggests superbugs can be flushed out of the dark murky depths of the bowel and replaced with a mix of healthy gut bacteria. It is a new approach to tackling infections that resist antibiotics, which are thought to kill a million people each year. The focus is on the bowels which are ""the biggest reservoir of antibiotic resistance in humans"" says Dr Blair Merrick, who has been testing the pills at Guys and St Thomas' hospitals. Drug-resistant superbugs can escape their intestinal home and cause trouble elsewhere in the body – such as urinary tract or bloodstream infections. ""So there's a lot of interest in 'can you get rid of them from the gut?',"" says Dr Merrick. The idea of poo-pills isn't as far-fetched as it might seem. Faecal transplants – also known  as a trans-poo-tion - are already approved for treating severe diarrhoea caused by Clostridium difficile bacteria. But scientists noticed hints that faecal transplants for C. difficile also seemed to get rid of superbugs. New research has focused on patients who had an infection caused by drug-resistant bacteria in the past six months. They were given pills made from faeces which people had donated to a stool bank. Each stool sample is tested to ensure it does not contain any harmful bugs, undigested food is removed and then it is freeze dried into a powder. This is stored inside a pill that can pass through the stomach unscathed and reach the intestines where it dissolves to release its poopy powdery payload. The trial has taken place on 41 patients at Guy's and St Thomas' hospitals in London to lay the groundwork for a large-scale study.  It showed patients were up for taking a poo pill and the donated bacteria were still being detected in the bowels at least a month later. Dr Merrick says there are ""really promising signals"" that poo pills could help tackle the rising scourge of superbugs and that donor bacteria could be going to microbial war with the superbugs as they compete over food and space on the lining of the gut and either rid the body of them completely or ""reduce them down to a level that doesn't cause problems"". The study also suggests the array of gut bacteria becomes more varied after the therapy. This is a sign of good health and ""may well be promoting colonisation resistance"" so it is harder for new infectious bugs to get in. ""It's very exciting. There's a real shift from 20 years ago where all bacteria and viruses were assumed to do you harm; to now where we realise they are completely necessary to our overall health,"" says Dr Merrick. Earlier this week scientists showed the good bacteria our bodies meet – in the hours after we are born – seem to halve the risk of young children being admitted to hospital with lung infections.  Our body's own human cells are outnumbered by the bacteria, fungi and others that live inside us - known as the microbiome. This has led to research implicating the microbiome in everything from Crohn's disease to cancer to mental health.  If poo pills are proven to work against superbugs in larger studies then the researchers think they could be used for both treatment and prevention in people at risk.  Medical procedures that suppress the immune system - including cancer therapies and organ transplants - can make the body more vulnerable. ""A lot of these individuals come to a lot of harm from drug resistant organisms,"" Dr Merrick. The UK's drugs regulator – the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) – said there were more than 450 microbiome medicines currently in development. ""Some of them will succeed, so I do think we will see them coming through quite soon,"" said Dr Chrysi Sergaki, the head of microbiome research at the MHRA. ""We could potentially, in the future, replace antibiotics with microbiome [therapies] - that's the big picture, so there's a lot of potential."" Copyright 2025 BBC.

6/8/2025,Article,Culture,Five works that reveal Banksy's hidden philosophy,https://www.bbc.com//culture/article/20250602-five-works-that-reveal-the-philosophy-of-banksy,"Banksy's new mural in Marseille is not the first image he has connected to the history of ideas. From Plato to Foucault, a Banksy expert reveals the philosophy behind these popular artworks. Which is the real you, the person you are now or the one you are capable of becoming? It's a heady question, to be sure, and not one you would expect to be confronted with while strolling down a street in Marseille in the waning days of May. Yet it's precisely the existential dilemma that Banksy, who once asserted ""being yourself is overrated"" – has surreptitiously installed in a cloistered stretch of the quiet Rue Félix Fregier, the site of a new work – the latest installment in the elusive artist's decades-long career as a provocative philosophical prankster.  For more than 30 years, Banksy has spiked many of his most iconic works – from his girl reaching hopelessly for a heart-shaped balloon to his masked rioter hurling a bouquet of flowers – with barbed allusions to Old Masters, from Michelangelo to Monet, Vermeer to Van Gogh. But there's more. Beneath his stealthy stencils lies a deep and deliberate engagement with the history of ideas as well, from classical Stoicism to postmodern deconstructionism. On 29 May, Banksy posted on Instagram a photo of his first new piece in more than five months, piquing the internet's interest by withholding its precise location. Discovered shortly thereafter in the major port city in southern France, Marseille, the mural is, at first glance, deceptively simple: a tall silhouette of a lighthouse spray-painted on to a blank beige urban wall; a rusting street bollard positioned nearby; and a painted shadow stretching across the pavement, joining the real-world object to its augmented, if two-dimensional, echo. Stencilled across the black lighthouse are the words: ""I want to be what you saw in me.""  Anyone keen to find a source for the ideas that inform Banksy's new work needs merely to flip open any history of philosophy to Plato's seminal allegory of the cave (from the Fourth-Century BC treatise The Republic), then flip the ancient metaphor on its head. In Plato's parable, prisoners chained inside a cave mistake shadows on the wall for reality, unaware of the truer forms that cast them outside. But here, Banksy, being Banksy, baits us by switching the set-up, reversing the relationship between essence and shadow. In Banksy's mural, the drab bollard casts not a diminished imitation of itself, but something far grander – a lighthouse, a symbol of illumination and guidance. Here, it's the silhouette, not reality, that's true. Banksy's inversion urges us to ask where reality really resides: in what is, or in what might be? His poignant phrase – ""I want to be what you saw in me"" – is alluringly elastic. Is this the bollard dreaming of being more than it appears? Or the shadow wishing to become light? Or is it all of us – Banksy included – struggling to live up to the better versions imagined by those who believe in us? The answer is surely yes to all of the above. And it's a yes too to the question: 'is this new work a lamp capable of shining light on further levels of meaning in Banksy?' What follows is a brief look back at some of the artist's best-known works and how they too are invigorated by, and often upend, many of the most important philosophical tenets – both social and intellectual – that underwrite who we are and who we might be. Banksy's new mural in Marseille is not the first to be accompanied by an affecting caption connecting the piece to the history of ideas. Among his most famous murals, Girl with Balloon, which portrays a child reaching towards a heart-shaped balloon drifting away from her, first appeared in 2002 in various locations in London, including on the South Bank, alongside the consoling assertion, ""there is always hope"". That conviction, which fuels the ceaseless striving for an ideal that is seemingly unobtainable in the mural (there's no way that balloon is coming back) rhymes richly with aspects of 19th-Century German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer's ideas concerning an unquenchable and irrational ""Will"" as a fundamental force that drives humanity. When, years later, Banksy mischievously concealed a remote-controlled shredder in the frame of a version of Girl with Balloon that came up for auction in 2018, and sensationally destroyed the work before the eyes of aghast auction-goers, he succeeded in upping the ante on Schopenhauer's belief in the futility of desire by boldly manifesting it himself. Where there's a will there's a fray. Banksy's famous mural of a masked man frozen forever in the instant before he unleashes not a brick or a bomb but a bouquet of flowers may seem, at first blush, to exemplify a pacifist's commitment to peaceful disobedience. The work appears to echo the precepts of Mahatma Gandhi's Satyagraha – a philosophy of non-violence that the Indian ethicist coined in 1919. Banksy's fully flexed figure, incongruously armed with a fistful of beauty, appears to epitomise Gandhi's insistence on wielding moral, not physical, strength. Doesn't it? Or has Banksy slyly subverted the philosophical assertion of pacifistic force by portraying his hero as an enraged rioter? The figure's anger has not been tempered by an appeal to the higher ideals of beauty and truth. Instead, those ideals have been weaponised by Banksy. Here, beauty and truth are not disarming, they are devastatingly explosive. Banksy's mural in Marseille employs a tried-and-true technique to ensure the work protrudes into the urban space in which we'll encounter it – elevating its philosophical potential from something flimsy and flat to something undeniably urgent. It's a tactic he used in a 2007 work that appeared near London's Oxford Street in which he depicts a boy atop a precariously high ladder, spray-painting the penetrating observation that we are ""One Nation Under CCTV"" in outlandishly outsized letters. Also portrayed within the mural is a uniformed officer and his obedient police dog who surveil the young vandal, while above them all an actual CCTV camera, presumably recording everything, juts out from the wall. The endless layers of surveillance-within-surveillance to which the work attests – as we watch the state watch an officer watch the boy – captures with uncanny precision the philosophical contours of the vast and all-encompassing prison machine in which the French poststructural philosopher Michel Foucault believed everyone in society was now irredeemably enmeshed. In Foucault's study Discipline and Punish: The Birth of the Prison, he resuscitates a blueprint for a prison proposed by the British utilitarian philosopher Jeremy Bentham at the end of the 18th Century, ""The Panopticon"" (meaning ""all seeing""), and uses it as a menacing metaphor for how no one can escape the perniciously penetrating eye of the panoptical state.  Banksy's witty 2014 work Mobile Lovers shines a chilling light on the state of contemporary relationships. The mural depicts a couple whose almost affectionate embrace is interrupted by the deeper fondness they have for the warm glow of their smartphones. The French existentialist philosopher Simone de Beauvoir, who died in 1986, may not have lived long enough to witness the emergence of mobiles. Yet her profoundly influential 1947 book The Ethics of Ambiguity – published exactly 60 years before the iPhone was launched in 2007 – with its exploration of the devastation that detachment and disconnection can wreak on the realisation of our truest selves, is profoundly proleptic of our modern predicament. To be free, de Beauvoir insisted, requires a deep attentiveness to each other. She believed in the authenticity of human encounters, without which life is a futile performance, dimly lit by disposable devices, rather than something profound and meaningful.  How Banksy Saved Art History by Kelly Grovier, published by Thames & Hudson, is out now. -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.

6/8/2025,Article,Travel,How WW2 changed the French diet,https://www.bbc.com//travel/article/20250605-how-world-war-two-changed-the-french-diet,"More than 80 years after D-Day, the recipes and ingredients introduced during France's wartime occupation are slowly making a comeback. By June 1940, German forces had blitzed through France in just six weeks, leading more than half of the country to be occupied. As a result, French staples like cheese, bread and meat were soon rationed, and by 1942 some citizens were living on as few as 1,110 calories per day. Even after World War Two ended in 1945, access to food in France would continue to be regulated by the government until 1949. Such austerity certainly had an impact on how the French ate during and just after the war. Yet, more than 80 years after Allied forces landed in Normandy to begin liberating the nation on D-Day (6 June 1944), few visitors realise that France's wartime occupation still echoes across the nation's culinary landscape. In the decades following WW2, the French abandoned the staples that had got them through the tough times of occupation; familiar ingredients like root vegetables and even hearty pain de campagne (country bread) were so eschewed they were nearly forgotten. But as wartime associations have slowly faded from memory, a bevy of younger chefs and tastemakers are reviving the foods that once kept the French alive. There aren't many French residents old enough to vividly recall life in wartime France today, and fewer still would deign to discuss it. Author Kitty Morse only discovered her great-grandparents' ""Occupation diary and recipe book"" after her own mother's death. Morse released them in 2022 in her book Bitter Sweet: A Wartime Journal and Heirloom Recipes from Occupied France. ""My mother never said any of this to me,"" she said. BBC.com's World's Table ""smashes the kitchen ceiling"" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future. Aline Pla was just nine years old in 1945 but, raised by small-town grocers in the south of France, she remembers more than others might. ""You were only allowed a few grams of bread a day,"" she recalled. ""Some [people] stopped smoking – especially those with kids. They preferred trading for food."" Such widespread lack gave rise to ersatz replacements: saccharine stood in for sugar; butter was supplanted by lard or margarine; and instead of coffee, people brewed roots or grains, like acorns, chickpeas or the barley Pla recalls villagers roasting at home. While many of these wartime brews faded from fashion, chicory coffee remained a staple, at least in northern France. Ricoré – a blend of chicory and instant coffee – has been on supermarket shelves since the 1950s. More recently, brands like Cherico are reimagining it for a new generation, marketing it as a climate-conscious, healthful alternative traditional coffee. According to Patrick Rambourg, French culinary historian and author of Histoire de la Cuisine et de la Gastronomie Françaises, if chicory never wholly disappeared in France, it's in large part thanks to its flavour. ""Chicory tastes good,"" he explained. ""It doesn't necessarily make you think of periods of austerity."" Other products did, however, such as swedes and Jerusalem artichokes, which WW2 historian Fabrice Grenard asserted ""were more reserved for animals before the war."" The French were nevertheless forced to rely heavily on them once potato rationing began in November 1940, and after the war, these vegetables became almost ""taboo"", according to Rambourg. ""My mother never cooked a swede in her life,"" added Morse. Two generations later, however, Jerusalem artichokes, in particular, have surged to near-omnipresence in Paris, from the trendy small plates at Belleville wine bar Paloma to the classic chalkboard menu at bistro Le Bon Georges. Alongside parsnips, turnips and swedes, they're often self-awarely called ""les legumes oubliés""(""the forgotten vegetables"") and, according to Léo Giorgis, chef-owner of L'Almanach Montmartre, French chefs have been remembering them for about 15 years.  ""Now you see Jerusalem artichokes everywhere, [as well as] swedes [and] golden turnips,"" he said. As a chef dedicated to seasonal produce, Giorgis finds their return inspiring, especially in winter. ""Without them, we're kind of stuck with cabbages and butternut squash."" According to Apollonia Poilâne, the third generation of her family to run the eponymous bakery Poilâne, founded in 1932, a similar shift took place with French bread. Before the war, she explained, white baguettes, which weren't subject to the same imposed prices as sourdough, surged to popularity on a marketplace rife with competition.  But in August 1940, bread was one of the first products to be rationed, and soon, white bread was supplanted by darker-crumbed iterations bulked out with bran, chestnut, potato or buckwheat. The sale of fresh bread was forbidden by law, which some say was implemented specifically to reduce bread's palatability. ""I never knew white bread!"" said Pla. When one went to eat at a friend's home during wartime, she recalled, ""You brought your bread – your bread ration. Your own piece of bread.""  Hunger for white bread surged post-war – so much so that while Poilâne's founder, Pierre Poilâne, persisted in producing the sourdoughs he so loved, his refusal to bake more modern loaves saw him ejected from bakery syndicates, according to his granddaughter, Apollonia. These days, however, the trend has come full circle: Baguette consumption fell 25% from 2015 to 2025, but the popularity of so-called ""special"" breads made with whole or heirloom grains is on the rise. ""It's not bad that we're getting back to breads that are a bit less white,"" said Pla. For Grenard, however, the most lasting impact the war left on French food culture was a no-waste mindset. ""What remains after the war is more of a state of mind than culinary practices,"" he said. Rambourg agreed: ""You know the value of food when you don't have any."" The French were forced to get creative with what they had. In France's south-eastern Ardèche department, Clément Faugier rebranded its sweetened chestnut paste as Génovitine, a name whose medical consonance made it easier to market as a fortifier and even prescribe. In the coastal Camargue region, local samphire suddenly stood in for green beans. Morse's great-grandfather foraged for wild mushrooms in the nearby Vosges mountains, and in cities, those with balconies planted their window boxes with carrots or leeks. Paris' public Jardin des Tuileries was even transformed into collective kitchen gardens. According to Rambourg, this subsistence mindset ""would affect the entire generation that lived through the war, and our parents, because they were the children of our grandparents, who knew the war."" More like this: • How French winemakers outwitted the Nazis • The top-secret meeting that helped win D-Day • The French cocktail born from a banned spirit As the need for these subsistence methods dissipated, French cuisine underwent another period of change. In 1963, the country welcomed its first Carrefour hypermarket, and large-scale supermarkets soon supplanted small shops. According to Grenard, this was partly due to ""suspicion"" following corruption during the German occupation, when some grocers inflated prices far past the norm, just because they could . ""At the end of the war, consumers held real rancour against small shopkeepers,"" said Grenard. ""In a supermarket, the prices are fixed.""  Fast-forward eight decades, and some locals, now motivated by climate change are turning back to small, local grocers, such as the locavore Terroir d’Avenir shops dotting Paris. Others are reaching into the nation's past to resuscitate techniques like canning, preserving and foraging that saved many French residents during the war, according to Grenard. ""The people that got by the best were the ones who had reserves."" Today, filling the larder with foraged food has become popular once again. In Kaysersberg, Alsace, chef Jérôme Jaegle of Alchémille puts this ancestral knowledge centre-stage by offering wild harvesting workshops culminating in a multi-course meal. And in Milly-la-Forêt, just outside Paris, François Thévenon highlights the foraging techniques he learned from his grandmother with classes teaching others how to seek out these edible plants themselves. ""After the war"", he explained, ""people wanted to reassure themselves that they wouldn't lack anything anymore."" They turned, he said, to overconsumption, specifically of meat, which even his foraging grandmother ate every day, at every meal. ""You often hear when you ask older folk why they no longer eat wild plants, that it's because they don't have to,"" Thévenon said, who forages for wild plants because he believes it's good for his health and that of the planet. According to Apollonia, the war didn't only change how France eats. ""It probably changed the way the world eats,"" she asserted. Today, the techniques and philosophies that helped the French survive are slowly coming back to life. -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.  For more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.   Copyright 2025 BBC.

6/8/2025,Article,Travel,Eight rare juices you can only try in the Amazon,https://www.bbc.com//travel/article/20250529-eight-rare-juices-you-can-only-try-in-the-amazon,"Far from smoothie bars and powdered sachets, these wild Amazonian juices are pulped just hours after picking – making them rich in flavour and cultural meaning. The Amazon is not only the world's largest and most biodiverse ecosystem – it's also one of the most delicious. Among the thousands of native species, around 220 trees are known to bear edible fruit, many of which never leave the jungle. Some are too delicate to export, while others are little known beyond the communities that have nurtured them for generations. But along the Amazon River and its tributaries – from Peru's misty highland jungle to the floodplains of northern Brazil – travellers can find market stalls and cafe counters brimming with thick, vibrant juices that capture the flavour of the forest. These are the fruits you're unlikely to find bottled or powdered at home, often pulped just hours after harvest, served chilled in the tropical heat and prized not only for their nutrients but for their rich textures and sharp tangs. Here are eight juices worth seeking out, whether for their bold flavours, cultural significance or the thrill of trying something new. On the eastern slopes of the Andes, where rivers cascade in dramatic waterfalls into the Amazon Basin, travellers will find the aguaje fruit of the Moriche palm. In the small Peruvian city of Tingo Maria, markets are piled high with silver trays of the armadillo-like fruit. Locals soak them in water for a day or two, before peeling the brown armour to reveal an intensely orange flesh. The pulp is soaked, mashed and transformed into aguajina – a thick and custardy drink that tastes like cross between pumpkin pie and flan. BBC.com's World's Table ""smashes the kitchen ceiling"" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future. Some locals say that the fruit contains oestrogen compounds and men should be careful of drinking too much of it, though there is little scientific evidence. ""The aguajina is very useful – for the bone, for the skin, for the complexion – especially for women,"" says Gianina Pujay, an aguajinera who sells the drink across from Tingo Maria's fruit market. In the same region, the cocona fruit, a tropical relative of the common tomato, yields a tangy juice that tastes like a pineapple-papaya hybrid with a thick, almost oily body.  ""Many Amazonian fruits are consumed in juice form because their pulp is acidic, fibrous or difficult to eat raw, like the cocona,"" explains Miluska Carrasco, a researcher and nutritionist at Peru's Instituto de Investigación Nutricional, ""It's also a practical way to use them quickly before they spoil."" Descending from the verdant slopes of the Andes into the Amazon Basin, the rivers slow down and transform into thoroughfares of commercial activity. On the banks of the Ucayali River is the river port city of Pucallpa, the furthest Peru's road system will take you into the centre of the Amazon. Here, where container barges, passenger ships and canoes all move goods around the forest, camu camu is a must-drink juice.  The small, tart, plum-like fruit tastes like a sour strawberry with a hint of peach, and is a favourite of local juice vendors. ""[It] has more vitamin C than oranges,"" says Carrasco, ""[as well as] other bioactive compounds."" Where a navel orange provides about 6mg of vitamin C per 100g, the camu camu contains more than 2,000mg for the same amount of flesh.  The season for camu camu is short, however, typically between January and March, so take advantage of the fresh juice when it's available. Locals also eat the little plums with salt; just spit out the seeds.  In the heart of Brazil's vast Amazonas state, 700 miles east of Pucallpa as the toucan flies (and at least a week or more on a river boat), tucumã palms provide an orange fruit that's only in season from February to August. During this time, it's often eaten for breakfast with cassava flour and is a key ingredient in the state's signature x-caboquinho sandwich, where slices are layered with salty coalho cheese and sweet chunks of fried plantains. To make juice from the notoriously fibrous tucumã, vendors use peelers, blenders and sieves to reduce shavings of the fruit to a pulp and then filter out the lightly nutty liquid. According to Francisco Falcão, a farmer in the community of Bom Jesus in the Tefé National Forest, ""people say that tucumã is good to eat and improves sight and skin"". Indeed, the fruit is rich in both manganese and calcium. Where kiwi, which is relatively high in calcium, contains around 30mg of calcium per 100g, tucumã has been measured to contain around four times as much. Also in the Tefé region, ""there's a palm tree that people eat the fruit of,"" says Falcão. ""Pupunha is a plant that we harvest starting in December and ending February."" Spanish-speaking parts of the Amazon know this oily palm fruit as pejibaye or pijuayo, and it is a key source of natural fats as well as vitamin B1 and vitamin E.   The pupunha grow in clusters of orange and red acorn-shaped fruit. They cannot be eaten raw, but once boiled they make a filling snack akin to an oily sweet potato. The boiled fruits also produce a creamy orange juice once fully pulped. In Peru, forest communities ferment the pulp into a lightly alcoholic drink called chicha or masato – especially during times of harvest.    In Manaus, capital of the Amazonas, reliable refrigeration means locals and visitors can enjoy fruits in various forms. The thick shell of the cupuaçu contains a collection of seeds surrounded by a fleshy white pulp. That pulp can be transformed into silky, tangy juice. But lately, locals have been incorporating its juice into ice cream. Indeed, the rest of Brazil is catching on, with ice cream parlours in Rio de Janeiro now offering the flavour too. More like this: • Spain's 'white gold' super-drink • A decadent avocado smoothie to break the Ramadan fast • The Caribbean's cooling, healthy elixir for summer Cupuaçu tastes like a creamy pineapple – surprising given that it's a close relative of cacao. ""It's the same genus as cacao and people make cupulate [as opposed to chocolate from it],"" says Daniel Tregidgo, a researcher at Brazil's Mamirauá Institute for Sustainable Development. ""When you go to the markets there are huge piles of cupuaçu seeds. I look at that and I say that's hipster chocolate right there."" Why haven’t we heard of cupulate yet? In Tregidgo's opinion, ""It's a matter of investment. If you take something from the middle of Amazon and you try to get it out into the global market without being exploitative, it is a bit tricky."" Bars produced from cupuaçu have the flavour of chocolate but retain some of their citrus piquancy. In the Amazon delta, jenipapo is known for its traditional use as a blue dye and a temporary tattoo ink. The fruit itself, which grows all along Brazil's coast in addition to the Amazon, has a yellowish pulp that's a great source of vitamin B1 and zinc. While jenipapo can be consumed as a fresh juice that tastes a bit like dried apricots, try ordering licor de jenipapo, an infused cachaça liqueur served in small bars and botecos. While açaí has become a global wellness trend, the version served in the Amazon bears little resemblance to the frozen bowls found abroad. What many travellers don't realise is that there are seven distinct açaí palm species. Locals distinguish between açaí-do-Pará, açaí-do-mato and juçara, depending on region. In Belém, for example, vendors use pneumatic presses to extract the berry's thick, purplish pulp – sold in clear bags and consumed straight out of bowls with spoons, as if a purple gazpacho. Outside of its natural range in Brazil, the rest of the country enjoys the pulp prepared in yogurts and ice creams.  -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.  For more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.  Copyright 2025 BBC.

6/8/2025,Article,News,William warns ocean life 'diminishing before our eyes',https://www.bbc.com//news/articles/c3d4387x1d0o,"The Prince of Wales has described the challenge of protecting the world's oceans as ""like none that we have ever faced before."" In a speech delivered to the Blue Economy and Finance Forum in Monaco, Prince William said life on the ocean floor was ""diminishing before our eyes"" and called for ambitious action ""on a global, national and local level"". At the Grimaldi Forum, named after Monaco's royal family, the Prince spoke in both English and French as he laid out what was at risk. ""The truth is that healthy oceans are essential to all life on earth. They generate half of the world's oxygen, regulate our climate and provide food for more than three billion people,"" he said. Rising temperatures, pollution and overfishing are causing huge damage to the world's oceans and the communities that rely on them. The forum comes ahead of the UN Ocean Conference in Nice, France, this week, with the events looking at the role oceans play in global trade, food security and sustainable energy. In Monaco on Sunday, the Prince was speaking to an audience of environmentalists, scientists and investors – many of whom have travelled there with a view to financing ocean protection projects. Prince William acknowledged that investing in ocean work can be a tricky proposition for investors. ""All too often, it can feel distant and disconnected from our everyday lives, allowing us to forget just how vital it is,"" he said. ""We must realise the potential of the blue economy for our ecosystems, our economies and our communities."" The Prince was speaking as founder of the Earthshot Prize, which gives out five £1m prizes each year for the best solutions to the greatest climate challenges. Several Earthshot winners and past finalists were in the audience. Enric Sala, of the National Geographic Society's Pristine Seas project, was a finalist in 2021 and has pioneered work to protect marine life. He is also part of the team that has produced Sir David Attenborough's new film, Oceans, which Prince William described as ""the most compelling argument for immediate action I have ever seen"". ""Watching human activity reduce beautiful sea forests to barren deserts at the base of our oceans is heartbreaking,"" the Prince said. ""For many, it is an urgent wake up call to just what is going on in our oceans. But it can no longer be a matter of 'out of sight, out of mind'."" He ended his speech saying action was needed for future generations and quoted Sir David. ""If we save the sea, we save our world."" The Prince interviewed Sir David at the premiere of Oceans last month, with the film described by its producer as ""the greatest message [Sir David] has ever told"". Kensington Palace described the speech as a ""landmark intervention"" by Prince William, using his platform to generate change and bring in investments to scale up ocean solutions. While in southern France, the Prince met President Chavez of Costa Rica, France's President Macron and Prince Albert of Monaco - a supporter of many oceans projects and a key player at the forum. Prince William will also attend a closed session, held in private, with ocean experts and investors. Additional reporting by Adam Hale. Copyright 2025 BBC.
